Genome-wide association studies for VWF have identified novel candidate genes that may regulate VWF levels in humans, including RAB5C (RAS-associated protein RAB5C). We hypothesized that RAB5C regulates VWF release from endothelial cells. Methods: We studied the effect of RAB5C on vesicle trafficking in human endothelial cells. We performed CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats) interference targeting 2 genetic variants linked to altered VWF levels and evaluated RAB5C expression by reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction. We silenced RAB5C or overexpressed RAB5C wild-type, constitutive active or dominant negative; and then, we measured VWF exocytosis from human umbilical vein endothelial cells to the media by ELISA. We performed proximity labeling and mass spectrometry to identify intracellular signaling pathways mediating the effects of RAB5C on VWF exocytosis. Results: We found that 2 genetic variants (rs9915255 and rs9912088 identified by genome-wide association studies for VWF levels) regulate RAB5C expression in stem cell-derived endothelial cells. We next silenced or overexpressed RAB5C in endothelial cells to assess its effect on VWF release. RAB5C silencing decreased VWF release after histamine stimulation, whereas overexpression of RAB5C or constitutively active RAB5C increased endothelial VWF release. To explore the intracellular signaling pathway mediating the effects of RAB5C on VWF exocytosis, we performed proximity labeling and mass spectrometry. We identified 147 proteins proximal to RAB5C, many of which are involved in vesicle trafficking. From this screen, we identified SNAP29 (synaptosome-associated protein 29), a SNARE (soluble NSF attachment receptor)-associated protein that plays a crucial role in vesicle fusion, as a key RAB5C interactor regulating VWF exocytosis. Conclusions: Taken together, our data demonstrate that RAB5C regulates VWF release in part through SNAP29 control of vesicle trafficking in endothelial cells. These findings validate genetic epidemiology data linking RAB5C to VWF levels in humans and provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms regulating VWF exocytosis."}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://127.0.0.1:1234/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.0, "prompt_source": "default (hardcoded)"}, "fraud_vector": "None identified", "funding_source": "Unknown", "investigation_status": "Published (Unchallenged)"}}

The most commonly used renal replacement therapy in Turkey and in many countries around the world is haemodialysis (HD). Glycaemia control is important in these populations. In this study we aimed to screen for glycaemic control and complications in a large population of diabetic HD patients in Turkey. Methods: A total of 16 043 patients were screened in 253 dialysis centres in Turkey and 5038 diabetic HD patients were included in the study. At participating centres, patients' diabetes history, complications, medications, haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) and other laboratory data were reviewed and recorded by nephrologists. Results: The average age of the patients was 64.0 ± 11.2 years and 56% were male. The mean HbA1c was 7.4 ± 1.5%. Patients were divided into three groups according to the HbA1c level (<6.5%, 6.5-8% and >8%). As the HbA1c levels increased, the mean systolic blood pressure and diastolic blood pressure increased significantly. In addition, as the HbA1c levels increased, the number of patients with coronary artery disease, patients undergoing coronary artery bypass graft surgery and the rate of patients with diabetic retinopathy and vision loss increased. Diabetic foot disease and amputation rates were also higher in the group with poor glycaemic control. The number of patients using intensive or mixed insulin was also higher in the group with high HbA1c levels. In ordinal logistic regression analysis, age significantly decreased and higher body mass index slightly increased the risk of a higher HbA1c.

Multirefractory AIHA is a more advanced stage of disease that is defined by a lack of response to at least three lines of therapy. CD19-directed chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy results in profound B-cell depletion and may be a useful approach to achieving drug-free remission in multirefractory AIHA. Methods: We enrolled patients from a compassionate-use program and those from a phase 1 study who had primary multirefractory AIHA. Each patient received a single infusion of autologous CD19 CAR T cells. The primary objective was to assess the safety profile - the incidence, characteristics, and severity of adverse events, including cytokine-release syndrome and immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome. Secondary objectives included efficacy and pharmacokinetic features. A complete response was defined by resolution of symptoms, an increased hemoglobin level, and normalization of hemolysis markers. B-cell reconstitution and the origin of relapse were analyzed with flow cytometry, single-cell RNA sequencing, and paired B-cell receptor sequencing. Results: CD19 CAR T cells were administered to 11 patients - 5 in the compassionate-use program and 6 in the phase 1 study. The median follow-up was 12.2 months (range, 7.3 to 21.9). All patients had a complete response; the median time to a complete response was 45 days (range, 21 to 153). The median duration of drug-free remission was 11.5 months (range, 6.8 to 21.0). Cytokine-release syndrome of grade 1 or 2 in severity occurred in 9 patients, and immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome of grade 1 occurred in 1 patient. A total of 15 infections occurred among 7 patients, with no infections of grade 4 or higher. One patient had immune effector cell-associated hematotoxicity of grade 3. In multi-omics assessments of sequential samples, naive B cells were predominant in the reconstituted B-cell population in patients with drug-free remission, and crosstalk between HLA-DRB5+ B cells, CD4+ T cells, and B-cell maturation antigen-expressing long-lived plasma cells contributed to a relapse-specific B-cell niche.

Here, we present a prophylactic strategy leveraging two human neutralizing antibodies, 1A2 and 1B6, which target distinct, conserved epitopes on the RSV prefusion F (pre-F) protein. Cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structural analysis revealed that 1A2 binds a \"waist\" epitope spanning antigenic sites IV/V, whereas 1B6 engages a \"head\" epitope bridging sites Ø/II/V, collectively stabilizing the pre-F trimer to block conformational transitions critical for viral entry. In vitro escape mutagenesis demonstrated that the 1A2/1B6 cocktail can resist viral escape (>20 passages), contrasting with rapid resistance to nirsevimab (targeting site Ø) and single antibodies [1A2: Gly 446 →Glu (G446E); 1B6: Gln 94 →Arg (Q94R) or Gln 94 →Lys (Q94K)]. Fc engineering extended serum half-lives while ablating effector functions, addressing potential safety concerns. Last, prophylactic administration in rodent models conferred robust protection against RSV A and B strains, including nirsevimab-resistant variants, with a 296-fold reduction in lung viral titers.

The pooling of effect size for CD patients in active and inactive phases was as follows: (PLT, MD = 55.51, 95% confidence interval [CI] (35.87, 67.16), Z = 6.45, P < 0.0001), (MPV, MD = - 0.42, 95% CI (-0.84, 0.01), Z = - 1.92, P = 0.05), (PF4, MD = 12.27, 95% CI (3.78, 20.76), Z = 2.83, P = 0.0046), (FIB, MD = 104.09, 95% CI (38.43, 169.75), Z = 3.11, P = 0.002). The pooled effect sizes of patients with UC in active and inactive phases were as follows: (PLT, MD = 58.48, 95% CI (38.71, 78.26), Z = 5.80, P < 0.0001), (MPV, MD = - 0.70, 95% CI (-0.93, - 0.47), Z = - 5.99, P < 0.0001), (PF4, MD = 3.03, 95% CI (-4.03, 10.10), Z = 0.84, P = 0.40), (FIB, MD = 109.73, 95% CI (45.64, 173.81), Z = 3.36, P = 0.001). PF4 levels were markedly elevated in DSS-induced UC mice. The heterogeneity sources analysis revealed that \"Study type\" was a statistically significant source of heterogeneity. Egger's test identified publication bias (t = 0.74, P = 0.47), indicating no significant asymmetry in the funnel plot. Conclusions: Platelet parameters varied at different stages of IBD disease activity. Active patients had significantly higher PLT, PF4, and FIB levels and significantly lower MPV levels than inactive patients. Continuous monitoring of platelet parameters is an effective strategy to learn about the activity of IBD disease and an efficient means of reducing negative outcomes."}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://127.0.0.1:1234/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.0, "prompt_source": "default (hardcoded)"}, "fraud_vector": "None", "funding_source": "Unknown", "investigation_status": "Published (Unchallenged)"}}

However, other subtypes including luminal ER+ and HER2+ breast cancers are largely unresponsive to ICB. Approximately 35% of TNBCs also do not fully respond to ICB. Here we hypothesize that improving priming by cross-presenting conventional dendritic cells (cDCs) with an agonistic CD40 antibody (aCD40) may be complementary to ICB. Systemic administration of aCD40 induced T cell proliferation and activation in tumor-draining lymph nodes and attracted effector T cells to the tumor bed from the periphery. This effect was largely due to activation and maturation of type 1 conventional dendritic cells (cDC1s). aCD40 alone slowed tumor growth and its combination with ICB cured tumor-bearing mice, accomplishing a \"vaccine effect\" and the immune-mediated rejection of tumor rechallenge. The anti-tumor effect of aCD40 was cDC1 and CD8 + T cell-dependent, whereas the rejection of secondary tumor rechallenge in cured mice required CD4 + T cells. Importantly, intra-tumoral administration of aCD40 combined with systemic or intra-tumoral ICB-to mimic neoadjuvant therapeutic approaches-induced complete regressions of both treated and distant tumors. These findings demonstrate aCD40 efficacy in preclinical models of breast cancer and further supports intra-tumoral administration of both aCD40 and ICB as an effective treatment that might limit systemic exposure and lower risk of immune-related toxicity."}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://127.0.0.1:1234/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.0, "prompt_source": "default (hardcoded)"}, "fraud_vector": "None identified", "funding_source": "Unknown", "investigation_status": "Published (Unchallenged)"}}

We assessed the efficacy and safety of a novel extended-release siRNA targeting KRAS G12D/V mutations (siG12D-LODER) combined with chemotherapy in LAPC. Patients and methods: This two-cohort, phase 2 multicenter, open-label study ( NCT01676259 ) evaluated siG12D-LODER with chemotherapy in patients with LAPC, irrespective of KRAS status. In cohort 1, patients were randomized to siG12D-LODER plus gemcitabine/nab-paclitaxel (Arm 1) or gemcitabine/nab-paclitaxel alone (Arm 2). In cohort 2, patients with LAPC or borderline resectable disease received siG12D-LODER plus standard chemotherapy (modified FOLFIRINOX or gemcitabine/nab-paclitaxel) in a single-arm, non-randomized design. Primary endpoints were overall survival (OS) for cohort 1 and objective response rate (ORR) for cohort 2. Secondary endpoints included progression-free survival (PFS), duration of response (DoR), OS (cohort 2), and ORR (cohort 1). Results: Fifty-nine patients were enrolled across two cohorts. In cohort 1, median OS in the modified intent-to-treat (mITT) population unselected for KRAS status was 22.7 months for siG12D-LODER + gemcitabine/nab-paclitaxel versus 21.9 months for chemotherapy alone (p>0.05). Among patients with KRAS G12D/V mutations, OS was 22.7 vs 13.4 months (HR 0.59, 95% CI 0.18-1.96, p=0.36). In cohort 2, ORR was 31.6% (95% CI 0.13-0.57) in the mITT (unselected for KRAS); in the G12D/V subgroup, ORR was 57.1%, similar to 63.6% in cohort 1. TEAEs were mainly procedure-related, including grade 1/2 gastrointestinal events and higher infection rates in the intervention arm.

Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP-1R) agonists were reported to be beneficial for ovarian cancer, but the causal effects and mechanisms on its heterogeneous subtypes remain unclear. Methods: We used genetic variants robustly associated with gene expression, protein level, splicing event, and DNA methylation of GLP-1R in six endocrine-related tissues (N ≤ 35,431) as genetic instruments to proxy the effect of GLP-1R agonism. To increase power, we conducted a meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies of ovarian cancer (29,066 cases, 461,542 controls), and identified 12 genome-wide associated variants, including two previously unreported variants: rs77247401 (MIR1208) and rs56159231 (PLEKHM1). Results: Here we show that gene expression of GLP-1R in pancreas is associated with a reduced risk of overall ovarian cancer risk odds ratio ([OR] = 0.94, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.89-1.00) and endometrioid ovarian cancer (ENOC; OR = 0.83, 95% CI = 0.72-0.95), which the finding is validated using splicing event of GLP-1R in pancreas (OR = 0.13, 95% CI = 0.02-0.86). However, null association is found for GLP-1R expression in pancreas with other ovarian cancer subtypes. The phenome-wide MR followed by mediation MR identifies six body composition and metabolic factors as mediators, including 18:2 linoleic acid. Conclusions: The protective effect of GLP-1R agonists on ovarian cancer, especially ENOC, needs further validation in large-scale and well-conducted clinical trials."}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://127.0.0.1:1234/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.0, "prompt_source": "default (hardcoded)"}, "fraud_vector": "None", "funding_source": "Unknown", "investigation_status": "Published (Unchallenged)"}}

Methods: Mosunetuzumab SC was administered with Cycle (C)1 step-up dosing in both cohorts: C1 Day (D)1, 5 mg; C1D8, D15 and C2 onwards, 45 mg. In FLMOON-2, oral lenalidomide was administered from C2 onwards, on D1-21 of each cycle. Treatment was administered up to C12 in FLMOON-2 and C8 or C17 in FLMOON-3.

The Phase 3, prospective, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 6-month, randomized clinical trial, MODIFY ( NCT03425539 ), aimed to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of lucerastat in adults with FD with moderate-to-severe neuropathic pain. The single-arm, open-label extension (OLE) ( NCT03737214 ) evaluated the longer-term safety and tolerability of lucerastat over 72 months. Lucerastat 1000 mg twice daily (n = 80), compared with placebo (n = 37), failed to affect neuropathic pain at Month-6, with no significant difference between treatment groups (LSM difference -0.42 [95% CI -1.23, 0.40], p = 0.32) (primary endpoint). In contrast, a decrease in baseline plasma Gb3 was observed at Month-6 in lucerastat-treated participants but not placebo-treated participants (LSM difference -873.53 ng/mL [95% CI -1097.53, -649.53], p < 0.0001; NS due to hierarchical testing). In an unplanned OLE Month-18 interim analysis, the eGFR slope (mL/min/1.73m 2 /year) in 93 participants with pre- and post-randomization (23-month median lucerastat exposure) eGFR data was -3.50 (-5.04, -1.969) and -1.48 (-2.64, -0.33), respectively.
