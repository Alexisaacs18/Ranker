openpay_sample_1,1,"Large single payment of $125,000 from Sample Pharma Inc to Sample Doctor 1 suggests potential kickback scheme tied to Medicare Part D prescribing",75,"The record documents a single, unusually large payment of $125,000 from a pharmaceutical company to a physician. This is a classic indicator of possible kickbacks under the Anti‑Kickback Statute and may also implicate the False Claims Act if the payment is tied to Medicare Part D prescriptions. The case is recent, unfiled, and no public disclosure or settlement has been noted, giving a strong basis for further investigation.","Sample Doctor 1 received a single payment of $125,000 from Sample Pharma Inc; Payment exceeds typical industry thresholds for legitimate gifts or research funding; Open Payments data indicates the payment was made in 2023 (within the 6‑year statute of limitations); No public settlement or DOJ announcement has been reported; Payment is potentially linked to Medicare Part D prescriptions",False Claims Act; Anti‑Kickback Statute,Sample Doctor 1; Sample Pharma Inc,Medicare,kickbacks
offlabel_0,2,Potential off‑label marketing of an unknown drug with 703 adverse event reports and 139 indications,45,"The record shows a large volume of adverse events and many indications, suggesting widespread off‑label use.  However, there is no explicit mention of Medicare/Medicaid billing or other federal program involvement, limiting the False Claims Act potential.  The case may still be viable under FDCA but would require additional evidence of federal program billing to qualify for a qui tam action.","703 adverse event reports linked to an unknown drug; 139 distinct indications reported, indicating broad off‑label use; Serious outcomes recorded in multiple reports; No explicit Medicare/Medicaid billing data provided",FDCA,Unknown drug manufacturer / prescriber,,off-label marketing
offlabel_1,3,Potential off‑label Lipitor prescribing pattern that may involve Medicare billing fraud,65,"The record shows a high volume of adverse events (64) linked to Lipitor with diverse indications, suggesting possible off‑label prescribing. While Medicare/Medicaid involvement is not explicitly stated, the next step recommendation to verify coverage implies a federal program angle. The pattern of multiple indications and serious outcomes raises the possibility of false claims if services were billed for off‑label use. The case is not publicly disclosed or settled, and the time frame appears recent enough to be within the 6‑year statute of limitations.","64 adverse event reports for Lipitor in FAERS; Serious outcomes reported (including unknown, 1, 2, 4, 6); Indication diversity of 4 suggests off‑label use; Next steps recommend verifying Medicare coverage and prescribing patterns",False Claims Act; Anti‑Kickback Statute,Lipitor,,off-label marketing
offlabel_2,4,Potential off‑label prescribing of JAKAFI that may lead to false Medicare claims,55,"The record shows a high volume of adverse events and multiple indications for JAKAFI, suggesting widespread off‑label use.  While no explicit Medicare billing data is provided, if such prescribing occurred for Medicare patients it could constitute false claims.  The lack of documented billing records and federal program mention limits the score to a medium‑potential range.",50 adverse event reports linked to JAKAFI; 5 different indications implying off‑label use; record flagged for further verification of Medicare coverage; no direct evidence of Medicare billing or claims data,False Claims Act; FDCA,JAKAFI; Manufacturer: Pfizer,,off-label marketing
offlabel_3,5,"Potential off‑label marketing of Humira with high adverse event volume and multiple indications, raising FDCA and False Claims Act concerns",85,"The record shows a significant number of adverse events (31) linked to Humira across 10 indications, suggesting systematic off‑label use. The high event volume and indication diversity imply a pattern that could be tied to Medicare billing for non‑approved uses, creating strong FDCA and False Claims Act exposure. No public settlement or DOJ announcement is noted, keeping the case open for first‑to‑file action.",31 adverse event reports linked to Humira; 10 distinct indications indicating off‑label use; Potential Medicare billing for non‑approved indications; No public disclosure or settlement noted,False Claims Act; FDCA,Humira,Medicare,off-label marketing
offlabel_4,6,"Potential off‑label marketing of LETAIRIS with 28 adverse event reports and 12 indications, possibly leading to false Medicare claims",78,"The record shows a significant number of adverse events linked to LETAIRIS used for 12 different indications, indicating widespread off‑label prescribing. If Medicare claims were submitted for these uses, the case could violate both the False Claims Act and the FDCA. The lack of public disclosure and the unfiled status make it a viable first‑to‑file opportunity, though confirmation of Medicare billing is required.","28 adverse event reports linked to LETAIRIS; Drug used for 12 distinct indications, many likely off‑label; Serious outcomes reported in 5 cases; Record flagged for verification of Medicare coverage and prescribing patterns; No public settlement or DOJ announcement noted",False Claims Act; FDCA,LETAIRIS; Pharmaceutical manufacturer of LETAIRIS,Medicare,off-label marketing

The case is recent enough for the 6‑year statute, and no public settlement or DOJ announcement has been noted.

offlabel_6,8,"Potential off‑label prescribing scheme for OMNISCAN with 22 adverse events across 13 indications, possibly involving Medicare patients",78,"The record shows a high volume of adverse events and multiple indications for OMNISCAN, suggesting systematic off‑label use. While Medicare involvement is not explicitly stated, the next step recommends verification of coverage and prescribing patterns, indicating a likely federal program connection. The pattern is not isolated, the damages could be significant, and no public disclosure or settlement has been noted.","22 adverse event reports linked to OMNISCAN; 13 distinct indications, indicating off‑label use; Serious outcomes reported in 5 cases; Case status listed as unfiled, no settlement disclosed; Next steps call for verification of Medicare coverage and prescribing patterns",False Claims Act; Anti‑Kickback Statute; Stark Law,OMNISCAN; Pharmaceutical manufacturer of OMNISCAN,Medicare; Medicaid,off-label marketing
offlabel_7,9,Potential off‑label prednisone prescribing that may trigger False Claims Act liability if Medicare billing is involved,78,"The record indicates a sizable number of adverse events (18) linked to off‑label use across 7 indications, suggesting a systematic prescribing pattern that could involve Medicare billing. While the source is FDA FAERS and no explicit Medicare claims are listed, the next steps recommend verifying Medicare coverage, implying a likely federal program connection. The pattern and volume of reports provide a solid basis for further investigation, but the lack of direct billing data keeps the score below slam‑dunk level.","18 adverse event reports linked to prednisone; Reports span 7 different indications, indicating off‑label use; Serious outcomes reported in multiple cases (1,3,5,6,4); Next steps include verifying Medicare coverage and prescribing patterns; Source is FDA FAERS, a reliable adverse event database",False Claims Act; FDCA,Unnamed healthcare provider prescribing prednisone,Medicare; Medicaid,off-label marketing
