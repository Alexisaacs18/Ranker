What fall risk communication exists within the context of patient care workflow that alerts nurses and other providers (physicians, physical therapists, pharmacists) regarding patients' fall risk status?\n\n   * What should the elements of alerts be at the point of care to support fall risk communication to nurses and other interdisciplinary team members?\n   * How should the alert be communicated to professional and paraprofessional providers, patients, and families?\n2. What communication of actions to prevent falls exists within the context of patient care workflow that promotes use of a fall prevention plan of care?\n\n   * Based on empirical data to reduce barriers and enhance facilitators, how can information systems be used to create and communicate a tailored evidence-based fall risk patient safety plan of care derived from the nursing fall risk assessment?\n   * Based on the C-IC conceptual model, how should the tailored evidence-based fall risk patient safety plan of care be communicated to professional and paraprofessional providers, patients, and families?\n\nPhase 2 Specific Aim: To develop a Fall Prevention Tool Kit (FPTK) prototype that includes 1) The Fall Risk Alert and Communication Plan that translates an individual patient's fall risk assessment into an interdisciplinary fall risk status communication and 2) The Patient Safety Plan of Care (PSPOC), that translates the individual patient's fall risk assessment into a decision support intervention that creates a tailored evidence-based plan of care to be used by professional and paraprofessional providers, patients, and family members across acute care settings.\n\nThe FPTK will be developed from fall risk assessment literature, evidence-based fall prevention guidelines and knowledge gained from Phase 1. FPTK components will target common risk communication/fall intervention requirements identified in Phase 1 across the four hospitals to facilitate testing the prototype in Phase 3 and to improve generalizability of our findings.\n\nPhase 3 Specific Aim: To evaluate the effectiveness of the FPTK prototype on reducing patient falls.\n\n1. Is the FPTK used to communicate fall risk status and facilitate adherence with the tailored patient safety plan of care recommendations?\n2. Is there a relationship between use of the FPTK and the incidence of falls (primary outcome measure) and fall-related injury (secondary outcome measure)?\n3. Is there a difference in the frequency with which tailored fall prevention interventions are documented when professional and paraprofessional providers, patients and family members have access to the FPTK when compared to usual care?\n\nPhase 4 Specific Aim: To evaluate satisfaction with the FPTK prototype and to generate recommendations for improvement.\n\n1. Are the interdisciplinary team members, paraprofessionals, patients and family members satisfied with the FPTK?\n2. What components are most useful and what recommendations can be made to improve the perceived usefulness and ease of use of the FPTK? If the FPTK works, then one will see that: 1) the tool kit is used and those helpful and useful components will be identified, 2) those who use the tool kit are satisfied with its use, 3) there is a decrease in the incidence of falls and falls with injury.", "eligibility_criteria": "Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* 2 units per hospital for participation.

Patient falls in hospitals are a key safety issue and represent the most frequently reported adverse event in acute care settings.

In contrast to mirtazapine, serotonin or norepinephrine reuptake inhibiting antidepressants acutely stimulate ACTH and cortisol secretion (Schüle 2007). The investigators also performed a study in depressed patients who were treated either with mirtazapine or with reboxetine using serial dexamethasone/CRH tests (week 0, 1, and 5) as a parameter for HPA axis activity. Mirtazapine, but not the norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor reboxetine was able to significantly reduce HPA axis activity already within one week (Schüle et al. 2006). Mirtazapine is known to have an earlier onset of antidepressant action than do SSRIs such as sertraline (Behnke et al. 2003) or antidepressants with dual mechanism of action such as venlafaxine (Benkert et al. 2006), possibly due to its rapid inhibition of HPA axis activity in unipolar depressed patients.\n\nSince mirtazapine and quetiapine have similar effects on the HPA system in healthy male volunteers (i.e. inhibition of ACTH and cortisol secretion), a rapid attenuation of HPA axis activity is also expected during quetiapine XR treatment in depressed patients.\n\nTherefore, in the present study the investigators goal is to investigate whether quetiapine fumarate XR at a dosage of 300 mg per day has an impact on HPA axis activity in unipolar depressed patients, as measured by serial dexamethasone/CRH tests (week 0, 1, and 5) and salivary cortisol profiles and whether putative effects of quetiapine XR on the HPA system are related to its antidepressant efficacy.", "detailed_description": "", "eligibility_criteria": "Inclusion criteria:\n\nFor inclusion in the study patients must fulfil all of the following criteria:\n\n1.

The eye is a self contained organ relatively isolated from the systemic circulation by the tight blood retinal barrier. Effective intraocular drug levels can be achieved with a much smaller amount of medication if injected intravitreally and this also results in minimal systemic exposure to the patient. Preliminary studies have shown that adalimumab may have a positive role in the management of uveitis in humans and can be an effective treatment intravitreally in animal models. No data has been published yet on intravitreal use of adalimumab in human subjects.", "detailed_description": "Abstract Purpose: Our aim is study to determine the efficacy and safety of intravitreal adalimumab in patients with active vision threatening uveitis, diabetic macular edema (DME) and choroidal neovascularization (CNV) despite standard treatment and to ensure its safety in intravitreal use in humans and its rapid onset of action.\n\nDesign: Pilot study, Non-Randomized, Open Label, Single Group Assignment, Safety Study.\n\nParticipants: 15 eyes with refractory CNV, DME, or uveitis will be injected with intravitreal adalimumab on a 3 week interval. Patients will satisfy the inclusion and exclusion criteria listed at the end.\n\nMethods: Initial treatment will consist of intravitreal adalimumab injection (1.5 mg/ 0.03 mL) in the eyes of patients with refractory CNV, DME, or uveitis and with visual acuity less than or equal to 20/70. Patients will be followed up every 3 weeks for a total of 6 weeks. Patients will have a baseline best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), slit lamp examination, dilated fundus examination, ocular coherence tomography (OCT), fluorescein angiography (F.A), and standard electroretinogram (ERG) and then these studies will be repeated every visit. If there is stabilization or improvement in visual acuity, decrease in edema on OCT and leakage on F.A after the first injection, then further injections will be given. The injection will be delayed if a patient develops an acute systemic infection and will be given when it subsides. If there is worsening of visual acuity after the first injection, patients will be shifted to the traditional treatment with intravitreal Avastin or intravitreal steroids. The paired sample Student t- test, Chi-square test, Pearson correlation and ANOVA will be used to analyze the mean visual acuity and central retinal thickness before and after treatment.\n\nMain outcome measures: to study the response to intravitreal adalimumab injection of patients with different visual acuity at baseline measured in terms of improvement in visual acuity, shrinkage in central retinal thickness, reduction in fluid leakage, and decrease in the active inflammatory uveitis.\n\nConclusion: Our goal is to study the efficacy and intraocular safety of intravitreal adalimumab in the treatment of refractory CNV, DME, or uveitis.\n\nBackground and Significance Inflammatory mediators are involved in the pathogenesis of diabetic retinopathy, choroidal neovascularization and uveitis. Owing to the propensity for visual loss, immunosuppressive treatment in the form of systemic and/or local therapy is often required for the management of cystoids macular edema from posterior uveitis, diabetes or age-related macular degeneration. There have been changes in the management of these conditions over the last few years, with immunomodulatory agents and new intraocular delivery systems. After the new trend of intravitreal corticosteroid and anti-VEGF, the new wave of so-called biologic response modifiers, predominantly monoclonal antibodies directed against inflammatory mediators or their receptors, but also some cytokines, represent a very promising generation of immunomodulating agents. There is rising evidence that these biologic drugs might be superior regarding their anti-inflammatory potential to conventional immunosuppressive therapies. Unfortunately, these new drugs are also very expensive so far. The yearly cost for a regular weight patient is around 20,000 dollars for Adalimumab or Infliximab. Therefore, they may not be universally available in countries with poorly funded health systems and for individuals with low economic status.\n\nIntravitreal injections of anti-VEGF and corticosteroids are currently the standard therapy in a multitude of retinal diseases such as choroidal neovascularization, diabetic maculopathy, proliferative diabetic retinopathy, and uveitis. However many patients respond only partially or develop complications like corticosteroid induced glaucoma or cataract. As such, we are looking for safe new therapies for various chorioretinal disorders aiming at visual improvement.\n\nAdalimumab (Humira) is a genetically engineered antibody against a proinflammatory cytokine, namely, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α). Adalimumab is the first member of a new class of TNF antibody compounds developed to contain exclusively human sequences. Adalimumab (ADA) is a subcutaneously (SC) self-administered fully human Ig G1 monoclonal antibody directed against tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα) which will be used intravitreally.\n\nWe do not know if adalimumab injections into the eye are effective and safe in most people. We are performing this pilot study to determine its efficacy and safety in patients with active vision threatening uveitis despite standard immunosuppressive therapy.\n\nUnlike infliximab, adalimumab contains no nonhuman sequences, making it indistinguishable in structure and function from naturally occurring human IgG1. Unlike infliximab, allergic reactions to adalimumab appear to be rare.\n\nSubcutaneous Adalimumab is currently used for the treatment of systemic inflammatory conditions and inflammatory disease of the eye with a relatively favorable safety profile. However, systemic administration carries the risk of systemic side effects, which in the case of adalimumab can be severe, such as increased risk of infection, reactivation of tuberculosis or increased risk for lymphoma.\n\nIntravitreal injection of Adalimumab The eye to be treated will be prepared with 5% povidone-iodine solution after which 1% lidocaine will be administered as a subconjunctival injection about 3 to 4 mm from the limbus to form a small bleb where the intravitreal injection will be given. Following that, 0.03ml of adalimumab will be injected intravitreally using a 30 gauge needle through the pars plana 3.5 mm from the limbus. Twenty minutes after the injection, a paracentesis will be performed in case the intraocular pressure was greater than 25 mmHg or if the optic nerve head was not adequately perfused. By the end of the procedure, the eyes will be covered by a patch for one day after which topical antibiotics (Ciloxan) will be applied 3 times per day for 3 days.\n\nPotential risks Intravitreal adalimumab have never been tried but as any intravitreal intervention, the risks of anti-VEGF therapy consist of local complications including endophthalmitis (0.16% per injection), retinal detachment (0.08% per injection), cataract (0.07% per injection), subconjuntival hemorrhage mainly related to the size of the needle used, and uveitis (0.09% per injection). Systemic administration carries the risk of systemic side effects, which in the case of adalimumab can be severe, such as increased risk of infection, reactivation of tuberculosis or increased risk for lymphoma. However, because the eye is a self contained organ relatively isolated from the systemic circulation by the tight blood retinal barrier, it is unknown how much the amount of the drug injected intravitreally gets reabsorbed systemically.\n\nPost-injection follow-up Patients will be examined every 3 weeks to measure the BCVA along with slit-lamp examination of the anterior segment, dilated fundus examination, OCT, F.A, and ERG. If any of the patients develops a decrease in visual acuity at least five letters of vision post first injection, he/she will be shifted to the traditional treatment with intravitreal avastin or intravitreal steroids. Else, if the vision is stable, patients will continue treatment\n\nThe total follow-up period of every patient will be 6 weeks.\n\nMain outcome Our goal is to study the efficacy and intraocular safety of intravitreal adalimumab in the treatment of refractory CNV, DME, or uveitis and to ensure its rapid onset of action. The main outcome measure will be the proportion of patients who lose fewer than 15 letters (3 lines) in BCVA score at 6 weeks compared with baseline. Secondary visual acuity endpoints at 6 weeks include 1) mean change from baseline in BCVA score; 2) the proportion of patients who gain ≥15 letters in BCVA; and 3) the proportion of patients with a Snellen visual acuity of 20/70 or worse compared with baseline. Other secondary endpoints include the effect of adalimumab on the central retinal thickness (CRT) as assessed by OCT and on the lesion size assessed by F.A.\n\nLiterature Cited 1-Intravitreal Adalimumab\n\n1A- Manzano et al evaluated the ocular toxicity of escalating doses of intravitreous adalimumab (Humira) in the rabbit eye.

The eye is a self contained organ relatively isolated from the systemic circulation by the tight blood retinal barrier. Effective intraocular drug levels can be achieved with a much smaller amount of medication if injected intravitreally and this also results in minimal systemic exposure to the patient. Preliminary studies have shown that adalimumab may have a positive role in the management of uveitis in humans and can be an effective treatment intravitreally in animal models. No data has been published yet on intravitreal use of adalimumab in human subjects.\n\n\nDetailed Description:\nAbstract Purpose: Our aim is study to determine the efficacy and safety of intravitreal adalimumab in patients with active vision threatening uveitis, diabetic macular edema (DME) and choroidal neovascularization (CNV) despite standard treatment and to ensure its safety in intravitreal use in humans and its rapid onset of action.\n\nDesign: Pilot study, Non-Randomized, Open Label, Single Group Assignment, Safety Study.\n\nParticipants: 15 eyes with refractory CNV, DME, or uveitis will be injected with intravitreal adalimumab on a 3 week interval. Patients will satisfy the inclusion and exclusion criteria listed at the end.\n\nMethods: Initial treatment will consist of intravitreal adalimumab injection (1.5 mg/ 0.03 mL) in the eyes of patients with refractory CNV, DME, or uveitis and with visual acuity less than or equal to 20/70. Patients will be followed up every 3 weeks for a total of 6 weeks. Patients will have a baseline best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), slit lamp examination, dilated fundus examination, ocular coherence tomography (OCT), fluorescein angiography (F.A), and standard electroretinogram (ERG) and then these studies will be repeated every visit. If there is stabilization or improvement in visual acuity, decrease in edema on OCT and leakage on F.A after the first injection, then further injections will be given. The injection will be delayed if a patient develops an acute systemic infection and will be given when it subsides. If there is worsening of visual acuity after the first injection, patients will be shifted to the traditional treatment with intravitreal Avastin or intravitreal steroids. The paired sample Student t- test, Chi-square test, Pearson correlation and ANOVA will be used to analyze the mean visual acuity and central retinal thickness before and after treatment.", "scraped_at": "2026-01-19T00:14:34.721930+00:00", "source": "ClinicalTrials"}

(1) Cholesterol lowering drugs are the most frequently prescribed medications in the U.S. and are known to have muscle, kidney and liver side effects for some users. Recent reviews conclude that benefits outweigh risks reporting statin and other cholesterol-lowering drugs to be safe and effective for most users. (2, 3, 4, 5) The new blood cholesterol level guidelines may recommend that more people take cholesterol lowering medications. According to the American Heart Association (AHA), total cholesterol levels should be below 180 mg/dL, with levels from 200 mg/dL to 239 mg/dL considered borderline high. Total cholesterol of 240 mg/dL and above is considered high. (6) However, published studies on the effect of blood lipids suggested that the actual cholesterol level itself is not the most important risk factor. It is the ratio between the level of total cholesterol and HDL that played a major role in the cardiovascular risk. The ideal HDL/cholesterol ratio should be higher than 25%. The ideal triglyceride/cholesterol ratio should be below 2.0. It is estimated that over 50 million adults in the U.S. have lipid levels higher than the above recommendations. (6) For persons who prefer conservative care, dietary modification is considered a first approach to the treatment and control of high cholesterol. (1, 7, 8) Hypertension is another risk factor for cardiovascular diseases and has close links to high blood cholesterol. (8) Between 40 and 50 million Americans have hypertension, which is defined as systolic blood pressure of at least 140 mm Hg or diastolic blood pressure of at least 90 mm Hg. (8) Hypertension is strongly, continuously, and independently related to coronary artery disease (CAD), stroke, renal disease, and all-cause mortality. For every 7.5-mm Hg increase in diastolic blood pressure, CAD risk increases 29% and stroke risk increases 46%. These risks have been shown for women as well as for men. Even within the high-normal blood pressure range, higher measurements result in greater risk of cardiovascular diseases. (9-10) It has been reported that diet and nutritional supplements are effective in reducing elevated blood pressure and reducing the risk of heart attack and stroke. (11-15) Diet and supplements have also been shown to have effects in reducing blood cholesterol. (16, 17)\n\nTraditional dietary control has focused on reducing intake of saturated fat and cholesterol. Recent studies have suggested that the traditional focus of lipid management may have been overly simplistic and that diets might be more effective if more attention was given on including certain foods or factors rather than just avoiding saturated fat and cholesterol. Gardner et al 2005 reported improved results with more plant-based foods, such as whole grains, vegetables, legumes, and fruits while simultaneously limiting saturated fat and cholesterol. (17) It has been reported that nutritional supplements and diet can reduce serum lipids and blood pressure. There are no reports on the effects of nutritional supplement on HRV despite the close link of the autonomic nervous system activity on regulation of blood pressure.\n\nThe Standard Process 21 day Purification Program consists of a controlled food intake regimen of mostly fruit and vegetables with restricted calories, protein and fats plus daily use of herbal and whole food based supplements. A recent case series of 28 chiropractic patients showed that the use of the SPPP resulted in significantly lowered total cholesterol.

Faced with restricted access to the operating room (anesthetists and nurse anesthetists requisitioned to participate in the care of patients in intensive care), colonoscopy under MEOPA was offered to patients who could have benefited from general anesthesia before the crisis. This monocentric retrospective descriptive study at the CHSF (Centre Hospitalier Sud Francilien) will make it possible to assess the quality of colonoscopies performed under MEOPA in the first line.\n\nThis is a feedback, the MEOPA having allowed us to continue and maintain the performance of screening colonoscopies during the COVID 19 epidemic.\n\n\nEligibility Criteria:\nInclusion Criteria:\n\n* Adult patients who had a colonoscopy under MEOPA between January 2019 and May 2021 at the CHSF.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Colonoscopy under general anesthesia\n* Refusal of data collection.\n\nAge Range: 18 Years - N/A\n\nSex: ALL\n\nHealthy Volunteers: False", "scraped_at": "2026-01-19T00:14:34.728828+00:00", "source": "ClinicalTrials"}

Cell production and quality control assessment procedures were carried out according to GMP protocols authorized by the Ministry of Health of Turkey. Allogenic adipose derived MSCs (ADMSCs) which were obtained from a healthy donor were applied to all patients in the study group. Five doses of ADMSCs were applied to the patients at 1st and 3rd day (post-thawed of frozen MSCs cryo-bag), 5th-7th and 9th day (re-plated ADMSCs vials) of therapy. Each dose of ADMSCs was prepared as 1 x 106 ADMSCs/kg. The vials containing ADMSCs were mixed with gentle motions before the usage; thus, it ensured product homogenization. ADMSCs were infused intravenously via central venous line in a physiological saline solution by using a blood transfusion set. The patients were monitored during all these procedures.\n\nPreparation of ADMSCs Sufficient cryo-preserved ADMSCs vials were thawed to provide the required dose for administration. The frozen ADMSCs were thawed and cultured in the Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) containing 10% human serum, 1% Penicillin- Streptomycin solution, and 1% stable glutamine (Biological Industries, Kibbutz Beit Haemek, Israel) at 37°C and 5% CO2 incubator which described before \\[16\\]. Briefly, ADMSCs were recovered and resuspended in physiological saline solution and transferred to the patient with the temperature-controlled bag. The morphology of cell appearance and the viability were assessed beside the identification of phenotypic characteristics of the cells and microbiological tests. Immunophenotyping characterization of ADMSCs was performed by using flow cytometry analyses (Beckman Coulter, USA) with antibodies against CD45, CD73, CD90, CD105, CD11b, CD19, CD34, CD44 (BD Stem Flow hMSC kit).\n\nCytokine Analysis Ten ml peripheral venous blood samples were collected before each MSCs infusion at 1st, 3rd,5th, 7thand 9th day of therapy.

Patients' demographic characteristics, underlying diseases, clinical and laboratory outcomes were recorded. The patients were monitored for unexpected adverse events. In the clinical follow-up of the patients APACHE II, SOFA (the sequential organ failure assessment score) score, clinical progression and outcome of patients were recorded. As laboratory following, inflammatory markers; C reactive protein (CRP), procalcitonin (PCT) and white blood cell (WBC), bleeding parameters (platelets, INR, fibrinogen), lactate, liver enzymes (AST, ALT), renal functions (creatinine) were also recorded. Laboratory test results were analyzed according to MSCs administration days. The differences of the laboratory tests were compared between the survivor and non-survivor patients according to MSCs therapy days.\n\nOutcomes of the patients were compared with the previous observational study conducted in the same Intensive Care Units (ICUs) as control. The day of death and 0-6th, 7-14th, and 15-28th days were determined as survival status and endpoint.

This study will evaluate:\n\n* How bevacizumab, given with chemotherapy before surgery, and then bevacizumab given alone after surgery, will affect locally advanced breast tumors\n* Side effects from adding bevacizumab to chemotherapy\n* Whether adding bevacizumab to chemotherapy for breast cancer will affect the heart\n* If receiving bevacizumab will have any effect on how patients recover from surgery\n* Side effects of the combinations of drugs used in this study\n\n\nDetailed Description:\nInitial trials of neoadjuvant chemotherapy administered for locally advanced tumors, including those in breast cancer, demonstrated therapy could induce sufficient tumor regression to allow for the resection of otherwise unresectable tumors. Subsequent demonstration of the equivalence of lumpectomy to mastectomy in patients with operable breast cancer, stimulated interest in the concept of using preoperative chemotherapy to reduce large, but operable, primary tumors to allow for lumpectomy in women who would otherwise require a mastectomy. Given the data from previous studies, it is appropriate to continue development of sequential doxorubicin/cyclophosphamide/docetaxel regimens to improve on clinical and pathologic response rates. FB-4 is a Phase II, single arm study for women with locally advanced human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative breast cancer diagnosed by core needle biopsy. The primary aim of the study is to determine the pathologic complete response rate in the breast following neoadjuvant chemotherapy combined with bevacizumab.\n\n\nEligibility Criteria:\nInclusion Criteria:\n\n* Patients must be female.\n* The patient must be greater than/equal to 18 years old\n* The diagnosis of invasive adenocarcinoma of the breast must have been made by core needle biopsy or limited incisional biopsy.\n* Patients must have clinical Stage IIIA, IIIB, or IIIC disease (American Joint Committee on Cancer \\[AJCC\\] staging criteria) with a primary breast tumor that is greater than/equal to 2.0 cm measured by clinical exam, unless the patient has inflammatory breast carcinoma, in which case measurable disease is not required.\n* Patients must have the ability to swallow oral medication.\n* The patient's Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status must be 0 or 1.", "scraped_at": "2026-01-19T00:14:35.023003+00:00", "source": "ClinicalTrials"}

CABG surgery is a common procedure used to increase blood flow to the heart and is typically applied in patients with severe cardiac diseases. However, this procedure can increase the risk of postoperative delirium, especially among elderly and critically ill patients.\n\nIn this study, the goal is to reduce this risk by implementing a care package. The care package includes optimal pain management, sleep regulation, mobilization, ensuring patient orientation, and appropriate medication management.\n\nThe results of the research will be used to determine whether the use of this care package is effective in reducing the risk of delirium after CABG surgery. This could potentially improve patient outcomes and allow for more efficient use of hospital resources.", "detailed_description": "Open-heart surgery is an effective treatment method used in the treatment of heart diseases today. However, after this operation, patients are at risk of postoperative delirium, which negatively affects the patient's recovery process. Open-heart surgery is a commonly performed surgical procedure; despite technological advancements and improvements in hospital care, delirium after open-heart surgery remains a common complicationDelirium, a condition causing acute dysfunction in the brain, leads to changes in patients' mental states and impairments in cognitive functions. Delirium after open-heart surgery is a common complication and can increase the patient's morbidity and mortality. Delirium extends the hospital stay and increases patient care costs. Therefore, it is important to implement a special care package to reduce the risk of delirium. The frequency of delirium in patients undergoing open-heart surgery varies between 20% and 50%. The post-open-heart surgery delirium prevention care package is a series of practices designed to reduce the patient's delirium risk. These practices may include; maintaining a regular sleep pattern, noise control, balancing hormone levels, family proximity, and music therapy.\n\nAntipsychotic drugs, a pharmacological agent, are commonly used in the treatment of delirium. These drugs help to alleviate the symptoms of delirium and make the patient more calm. However, antipsychotic drugs are effective in symptom management and their side effects worsen the patient's condition and the effectiveness of antipsychotic drugs on delirium is doubtful. It is extremely important to avoid routine application of antipsychotic drugs. Instead, non-pharmacological methods are preferred, such as providing a suitable environment, regulating noise and light levels, maintaining sleep patterns, increasing physical activity, preventing unnecessary drug use, and regulating fluid and electrolyte balance. These methods can reduce the risk of delirium and help the patient undergo a faster and more successful recovery process.\n\nThere is a significant place in the literature for non-pharmacological methods for the prevention of delirium. These methods include ensuring the suitability of the environment the patient is in, regulating sleep schedules, keeping noise and light levels under control, psychological support and rehabilitation, pain and symptom management, prevention of sensory disorders, reducing invasive procedures, increasing physical activity, encouraging sleep, preventing unnecessary drug use, family-centered care, regulating fluid and electrolyte balance, and arranging nutritional order. The implementation of these methods can help avoid delirium risk factors and contribute to a faster recovery process for the patient.\n\nDelirium is a very distressing condition for family members, especially those who observe delirium attacks. This situation can also have lasting effects on patients who remember delirium attacks in the hospital. It can also cause difficulties for the healthcare personnel caring for these patients. Therefore, it is extremely important to take the best possible precautions against delirium attacks or to treat the disease.\n\nFamily-centered care is an important factor in reducing the risk of delirium in patients during the postoperative period. Family members can be by the patients' side, provide moral support, and help patients feel more peaceful and comfortable in the postoperative period. Family members' support can reduce the patient's delirium risk, as it helps the patient maintain a familiar environment. A support network can also be critical in observing symptoms of delirium and ensuring appropriate treatment is sought.\n\nInvolvement of family members in patient care can be beneficial in many ways. For example, they can help orient the patient to time, place, and situation, provide emotional support, and communicate the patient's needs and preferences to the healthcare team. They can also encourage the patient to engage in physical activity, eat, and drink, which can help maintain their overall health and well-being.\n\nMusic therapy, one of the non-pharmacological methods, is also known to be effective in preventing delirium after open-heart surgery. Music therapy can help to reduce anxiety and promote relaxation, both of which can aid in delirium prevention.\n\nIn addition to these, maintaining a regular sleep pattern, controlling noise levels, and balancing hormone levels can be very effective in reducing the risk of delirium. Disruptions in sleep can lead to a higher risk of delirium, so ensuring the patient has a quiet and calm environment for rest can be crucial.\n\nIn conclusion, prevention of delirium after open-heart surgery is vital for the successful recovery of patients. A multi-faceted approach that includes non-pharmacological interventions such as environmental modifications, family-centered care, music therapy, and maintaining a regular sleep pattern, in addition to pharmacological treatments when necessary, is likely to be most effective. Further research is needed to identify the most beneficial and feasible interventions for preventing delirium after open-heart surgery.", "eligibility_criteria": "Inclusion Criteria:\n\nParticipants and Sample Criteria Inclusion criteria for the study:\n\n* Over 18 years of age,\n* Considered as a low-risk group according to American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA)\n* I-II and EUROSCORE scores\n* Undergoing open-heart surgery for the first time\n* Having an operation with on-pump and median sternotomy technique,\n* Mild and moderate hypothermia applied,\n* One to three coronary artery bypass grafts performed,\n* Left internal mammary artery and saphenous vein graft applied,\n* Surgery initiated between 08:00-12:00 hours,\n* Having no psychiatric diagnosis and therefore no drug therapy,\n* Not using corticosteroid derivative drugs,\n* No complications observed that may affect the surgery and ICU process,\n* Having a family member who can support the patient in the postoperative wake-up process,\n* Patients who voluntarily agree to participate in the research will be included.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Extended surgery due to complications,\n* Completion of the intraoperative process falls into the evening hours (after 16:00),\n* Consciousness level after extubation prevents participation in the study (Glasgow Coma Score \\<15),\n* Corticosteroid derivative drugs applied at any stage of the perioperative process, Surgery is canceled,\n* No family member is available to stay in the intensive care unit,\n* Wishing to withdraw from the research at any stage after voluntarily agreeing to participate in the study,\n* At any stage of the research, patients who do not wish to use earplugs or listen to music and wish to withdraw from the research, their data will be excluded from the study.", "minimum_age": "18 Years", "maximum_age": "", "sex": "ALL", "healthy_volunteers": true, "type": "protocol", "filename": "clinical_trial_NCT06036017.html", "text": "NCT ID: NCT06036017\n\nTitle: Determining the Effect of Care Package Implementation in Preventing Delirium in Patients Undergoing Coronary Artery Bypass Graft Surgery\n\nStatus: RECRUITING\n\n\nBrief Summary:\nThis research investigates the effectiveness of a care package used in the care of patients undergoing coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery in preventing postoperative delirium. CABG surgery is a common procedure used to increase blood flow to the heart and is typically applied in patients with severe cardiac diseases. However, this procedure can increase the risk of postoperative delirium, especially among elderly and critically ill patients.\n\nIn this study, the goal is to reduce this risk by implementing a care package. The care package includes optimal pain management, sleep regulation, mobilization, ensuring patient orientation, and appropriate medication management.\n\nThe results of the research will be used to determine whether the use of this care package is effective in reducing the risk of delirium after CABG surgery. This could potentially improve patient outcomes and allow for more efficient use of hospital resources.\n\n\nDetailed Description:\nOpen-heart surgery is an effective treatment method used in the treatment of heart diseases today. However, after this operation, patients are at risk of postoperative delirium, which negatively affects the patient's recovery process. Open-heart surgery is a commonly performed surgical procedure; despite technological advancements and improvements in hospital care, delirium after open-heart surgery remains a common complicationDelirium, a condition causing acute dysfunction in the brain, leads to changes in patients' mental states and impairments in cognitive functions. Delirium after open-heart surgery is a common complication and can increase the patient's morbidity and mortality. Delirium extends the hospital stay and increases patient care costs. Therefore, it is important to implement a special care package to reduce the risk of delirium. The frequency of delirium in patients undergoing open-heart surgery varies between 20% and 50%. The post-open-heart surgery delirium prevention care package is a series of practices designed to reduce the patient's delirium risk. These practices may include; maintaining a regular sleep pattern, noise control, balancing hormone levels, family proximity, and music therapy.\n\nAntipsychotic drugs, a pharmacological agent, are commonly used in the treatment of delirium. These drugs help to alleviate the symptoms of delirium and make the patient more calm. However, antipsychotic drugs are effective in symptom management and their side effects worsen the patient's condition and the effectiveness of antipsychotic drugs on delirium is doubtful. It is extremely important to avoid routine application of antipsychotic drugs.", "scraped_at": "2026-01-19T00:14:35.024323+00:00", "source": "ClinicalTrials"}

HIV infected people and others with compromised immunity are at greater risk for HPV-related complications. In particular, researchers are concerned about the risk of HPV infection to women, who may be infected by their male partners, especially if these partners engage in anal intercourse. HIV infected women tend to have multiple types of HPV (associated with a greater risk of HPV-related disease), are less likely to clear HPV-related conditions, and are more likely to progress to HPV-related disease. The quadrivalent HPV (types 6, 11, 16, 18) L1 virus-like particle (VLP) vaccine to be tested in this study was safe and generally well tolerated in previous studies conducted in healthy and HPV-exposed adolescents, young adults, and older women. However, it is still unclear if the vaccine will be safe and will elicit a similar immune response in younger children. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of the novel quadrivalent HPV (Types 6, 11, 16, 18) L1 VLP vaccine in HIV infected children 7 to 12 years of age.\n\nThis study had two stages and lasted at least 108 weeks. In Stage I, participants were stratified by CD4 percentage (CD4%) nadir and CD4% at study screening (Stratum A: CD4% Nadir \\< 15 and CD4% ≥ 15 at screening, Stratum B: CD4% Nadir ≥ 15 and \\< 25 and CD4% ≥ 15 at screening, Stratum C: CD4% Nadir ≥ 25 and CD4% ≥ 25 at screening). Within each stratification group, they were randomly assigned to one of two arms. During Stage I, Arm A (QHPV:Quadrivalent human papillomavirus vaccine) participants received 3 doses of vaccine, while Arm B (Placebo/QHPV) participants received 3 doses of placebo. Participants did not know whether they were receiving vaccine or placebo. Participants received their assigned intervention at study entry and Weeks 8 and 24. At Week 96, Stage II began, and all study participants were told if they received vaccine or placebo in Stage I. Arm A participants received an additional dose of vaccine at Week 96; Arm B participants received doses of vaccine at Weeks 96, 104, and 120. Over the course of the study, there were at least 12 study visits. A physical exam and blood collection occurred at most visits; medical history occurred at selected visits.\n\nAfter each vaccination, participants were observed for at least 30 minutes to monitor for any allergic reactions possibly resulting from the vaccination.

HIV infected people and others with compromised immunity are at greater risk for HPV-related complications. In particular, researchers are concerned about the risk of HPV infection to women, who may be infected by their male partners, especially if these partners engage in anal intercourse. HIV infected women tend to have multiple types of HPV (associated with a greater risk of HPV-related disease), are less likely to clear HPV-related conditions, and are more likely to progress to HPV-related disease. The quadrivalent HPV (types 6, 11, 16, 18) L1 virus-like particle (VLP) vaccine to be tested in this study was safe and generally well tolerated in previous studies conducted in healthy and HPV-exposed adolescents, young adults, and older women. However, it is still unclear if the vaccine will be safe and will elicit a similar immune response in younger children. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of the novel quadrivalent HPV (Types 6, 11, 16, 18) L1 VLP vaccine in HIV infected children 7 to 12 years of age.\n\nThis study had two stages and lasted at least 108 weeks. In Stage I, participants were stratified by CD4 percentage (CD4%) nadir and CD4% at study screening (Stratum A: CD4% Nadir \\< 15 and CD4% ≥ 15 at screening, Stratum B: CD4% Nadir ≥ 15 and \\< 25 and CD4% ≥ 15 at screening, Stratum C: CD4% Nadir ≥ 25 and CD4% ≥ 25 at screening). Within each stratification group, they were randomly assigned to one of two arms. During Stage I, Arm A (QHPV:Quadrivalent human papillomavirus vaccine) participants received 3 doses of vaccine, while Arm B (Placebo/QHPV) participants received 3 doses of placebo. Participants did not know whether they were receiving vaccine or placebo. Participants received their assigned intervention at study entry and Weeks 8 and 24. At Week 96, Stage II began, and all study participants were told if they received vaccine or placebo in Stage I. Arm A participants received an additional dose of vaccine at Week 96; Arm B participants received doses of vaccine at Weeks 96, 104, and 120. Over the course of the study, there were at least 12 study visits. A physical exam and blood collection occurred at most visits; medical history occurred at selected visits.", "scraped_at": "2026-01-19T00:14:35.025784+00:00", "source": "ClinicalTrials"}

Materials and Methods: Seventy-eight patients were randomized to an experimental group that received traditional physical therapy plus KT and a control group that received traditional physical therapy alone. Interventions were administered twice a week for four weeks. Assessment tools used were; RMDQ for disability, FABQ for fear-avoidance beliefs and NPRS for pain intensity.", "detailed_description": "This study followed a prospective experimental pretest-posttest control group randomized design with repeated measures. Two groups were included in this study, an experimental group and a control group. Both groups were tested with respect to three main outcomes which are disability, fear avoidance beliefs and pain intensity. Five points of measurements were used; at baseline, at the end of week 1, at the end of week 2, at the end of week 3 and at the end of week 4.\n\nA total of 88 patients with a primary complaint of low back pain were enrolled and consented to participate in the study. Potential study participants were assessed for study eligibility based on the pre-defined inclusion and exclusion criteria. Study flow chart. Subjects were pre-screened for known contraindications and precautions to thrust joint manipulation and exercises. No individuals were excluded from participation in this study based on race, creed, color, gender, age, national or ethnic origin, sexual orientation, disability, or health status.\n\nAfter obtaining the informed consent, participant's demographic information was collected including age, gender, ethnicity, contact information, emergency contact, employment status etc. History taking also included collecting information about patient's past medical history, family history, mechanism of injury, chief complaint, present history, number of days since onset, presence of previous episodes of low back pain, treatment for previous episodes, questions related to red flags, and review of systems and allergies. Patients were also checked for eligibility criteria. Pain characteristics were also documented including, pain intensity, location, duration, timing, character, aggravating and alleviating factors. History, review of systems and medical screening questionnaire were also used to identify red flags. Red flags are clinical features that may indicate a serious spinal pathology that warrant further investigation.\n\nEach participant was examined by the PI who conducted a thorough physical exam that included observation, palpation, and assessment of vertebral mobility, range of motion testing, muscle tests, neurological screening and special tests. Neurological examination included sensation for dermatomes, muscle testing for myotomes and deep tendon reflexes (Knee jerk and Ankle jerk). The allergy test for Kinesio taping was performed for all participants by the PI. An I strip of KT was applied on either side of lumbar spine at around 25% tension and left in place for 24 hours. The patient was checked during the second visit for any signs of adverse reactions such as rash or excessive hotness or itching in the tested area.\n\nThe PI then opened a new file for the participant that included all the information obtained from history taking, physical examination and any other assessments. This process took between 30 minutes and 45 minutes. In the second visit, the tape was removed and the patient checked for any abnormal reactions. The participant was then randomized to either the experimental group or the control group using random number generator.\n\nThe PI provided the research assistant with participant's basic information including the case number but the research assistant was not aware of the participant group allocation. The research assistant then performed all baseline outcome assessments required for the study which included disability as measured with the Ronald Morris Disability Questionnaire, fear avoidance beliefs as measured with Fear Avoidance Beliefs Questionnaire and pain as measured with the Numerical Pain Rating Scale. The research assistant conducted all study related measurements at baseline (W0), at the end of the first week (W1), at the end of the second week (W2), at the end of the third week (W3) and at the end of the fourth week (W4) and kept all data in a separate locked file cabinet. The second visit took approximately between 45 and 60 minutes to be completed including providing first treatment session. Assessments of study variables took 15 to 20 minutes.\n\nA priori analysis was conducted with an alpha level (α) of 0.05, an effect size of 0.25 and a power of 80 % using G\\*Power (Version 3.0.10). The results indicated that a total 78 subjects would be needed of two groups. However, considering a potential 10-15 % dropout or loss to follow-up rate, around 42 to 45 participants were considered for each group.\n\nBlinding the physical therapist (the principal investigator) who provided interventions to both groups in the study to the type of intervention was not feasible. Blinding the principal investigator to the assessment process was possible by using another physical therapist who conducted all measurements. Blinding the assessor to subject's group assignment was done to ensure unbiased ascertainment of outcomes. Randomization also served to reduce the risk of selection bias by the principal investigator. An online random number generator available at http://www.graphpad.com/quickcalcs/randomize1/ was used to randomly assign participants to two equal groups. The study was conducted at Quick Docs Medical Center located in Brooklyn, NY. This facility is the primary place of employment of the principal investigator and the research assistant. The facility has private treatment rooms where each subject was interviewed and assessment and intervention sessions were conducted. All research activities were approved by the IRB of NOVA Southeastern University. IRB approval was granted on the 29th of June of 2015. All patients provided informed consent prior to participation.\n\nThe outcome variables which were included in the study are; disability, fear-avoidance beliefs and pain intensity. The primary outcome was disability and the secondary outcomes were fear avoidance beliefs and pain intensity. Disability was evaluated with the Ronald-Morris Disability Questionnaire (RMDQ). RMDQ is a patient reported outcome measure that is composed of 24 yes/no questions to assess functional status and disability in patients with low back pain. RMDQ scores can range from 0, the highest functional status indicating no disability, to 24, the lowest functional status indicating maximum disability. Patients were asked to mark the sentences that describe them at the time of evaluation.\n\nFear avoidance beliefs questionnaire (FABQ) is an assessment tool that is developed based on the fear avoidance model of exaggerated pain perception. This model is a theoretical approach of analyzing the behavior of patients with acute conditions as some of these patients recover successfully while others develop chronic pain. FABQ measures patient's fear of pain in terms of patients' behavior as a result of pain in relation to general physical activities and work related functions because of their fear. It consists of two subscales, a work subscale and a physical activity subscale; each item is scored from 0 to 6. Greater fear and consequent avoidance beliefs are associated with higher scores.\n\nAssessment of pain was done using the numerical rating of pain scale (NPRS), which is an 11-point scale from 0 to 10, 0 indicating \"no pain\" and 10 indicating \"the worst pain\". Pain assessments were conducted at baseline and at the end of each week, for four weeks. A verbal response was required from each participant. Three measurements were taken, the current pain level, the worst pain level over the last 24 hours and the lowest pain level over the last 24 hours. The average of the three readings was used as the average pain level for each participant.\n\nDescriptive statistics was conducted to describe all basic characteristics of participants of both groups. Variables such as age, gender, presence of previous episodes, and duration of the current episode were described. Graphical representation of the above-mentioned variables as well as the main outcome measures were obtained from statistical software. Tables and figures were used to provide an understanding of all relevant study data. Mixed model analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to reveal main effects and interaction effects. The group type was the between-subjects' variable and the time was the within subjects' variable. Bonferroni post-tests were used to compare between groups at each individual point of time. SPSS Version 23.0 (SPSS, Inc., IBM Corporation, Somers, New York) and GraphPad Prism (Version 6.01 for Windows; GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA, USA) were used for statistical analysis.\n\nAll patients' data and records pertaining to this research study and any relevant information were stored in a locked file cabinet at the facility in which the study was conducted. A case number was used to indicate patient's identity on these records. This information was only accessible to the principal investigator, the independent physical therapist, and other research study staff involved in conducting this research study. All assessment data were kept in a separate locked file cabinet which was accessible only to the independent physical therapist. To ensure confidentiality, no confidential information such as patient's name, address, phone number, or any other information that might possibly be used to link the data to the patient was transmitted or shared. These measures were used to ensure patients' confidentiality.", "eligibility_criteria": "Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Both genders, age between 18 and 75.\n* Primary complaint of pain in the lower back located between the costal margins and the gluteal folds, less than 4 weeks in duration with or without leg pain but symptoms not distal to the knee.\n* A new episode of low back pain.

No additional tests or treatments will be performed as part of the study.\n\nThe main goal of the study is to examine the relationship between SOFA-2 scores and intensive care unit mortality. The results are expected to help clinicians better assess disease severity and outcomes in critically ill patients.\n\n\nDetailed Description:\nThis is a multicenter, prospective, observational study designed to evaluate the feasibility and prognostic performance of the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment-2 (SOFA-2) score in adult intensive care units across Türkiye.\n\nAdult patients aged 18 years or older who are admitted to participating intensive care units and remain in the ICU for more than 24 hours will be eligible for inclusion. Pregnant patients, organ donors, patients younger than 18 years, and those with unknown ICU discharge outcomes will be excluded.\n\nDemographic characteristics, reasons for ICU admission, comorbid conditions, and routinely collected clinical and laboratory data will be prospectively recorded using standardized case report forms. SOFA and SOFA-2 scores will be calculated based on data obtained during the first 24 hours following ICU admission. For patients with an ICU stay longer than 72 hours, additional SOFA and SOFA-2 scores will be recorded at 72 hours.\n\nPatients will be followed until ICU discharge or death. No study-specific interventions, additional diagnostic procedures, or changes to standard clinical management will be implemented as part of the study.\n\nThe study will assess the feasibility of real-time SOFA-2 score calculation, evaluate its association with ICU mortality, and compare its prognostic performance with the original SOFA score. Analyses will account for the multicenter structure of the study and variations across participating intensive care units.", "scraped_at": "2026-01-19T00:14:35.027157+00:00", "source": "ClinicalTrials"}

{"nct_id": "NCT03958968", "title": "Impact of Exposure to Cosmetics on Sensitive Skin", "status": "COMPLETED", "brief_summary": "The concept of sensitive or reactive skin was evoked in 1947 and developed in the 1970s and is now widely recognized. The international pruritus society has proposed an international consensus definition: sensitive skin is defined as a syndrome manifested by the occurrence of unpleasant sensations (tingling, burning, pain, pruritus, tingling) in response to stimuli that normally do not not cause such sensations. The triggering factors can be cosmetics, water, cold, heat, temperature variations, wind ... etc.\n\nThe physiopathological mechanisms are debated and several hypotheses exist. Sensitive skin can be considered as a decrease of the threshold of cutaneous tolerance. Sensitive skin is linked to abnormalities of the cutaneous nervous system, which becomes hyper-reactive. This hyperreactivity can be modulated by multiple factors. Exposure to cosmetics could be one of the main triggers for sensitive skin, especially for women.

The international pruritus society has proposed an international consensus definition: sensitive skin is defined as a syndrome manifested by the occurrence of unpleasant sensations (tingling, burning, pain, pruritus, tingling) in response to stimuli that normally do not not cause such sensations. The triggering factors can be cosmetics, water, cold, heat, temperature variations, wind ... etc.\n\nThe physiopathological mechanisms are debated and several hypotheses exist. Sensitive skin can be considered as a decrease of the threshold of cutaneous tolerance. Sensitive skin is linked to abnormalities of the cutaneous nervous system, which becomes hyper-reactive. This hyperreactivity can be modulated by multiple factors. Exposure to cosmetics could be one of the main triggers for sensitive skin, especially for women. This can be explained by the wide use of cosmetics (in France women apply an average of 16 different cosmetics per day), by overconsumption of cosmetics, by exposure to potentially irritating ingredients. Sensitive skin would be less tolerant to the frequent and prolonged use of cosmetics.

{"nct_id": "NCT04204668", "title": "A Randomized Trial Comparing Surgical Treatments for Neuroma Pain in Amputees", "status": "WITHDRAWN", "brief_summary": "Amputees often suffer from relentless pain and disability resulting from symptomatic neuromas within the amputation stumps. When conservative measures fail to address these symptoms, two contemporary surgical approaches to treat symptomatic neuromas have become the most popular. Targeted muscle reinnervation (TMR) is a procedure which involves transferring the injured proximal nerve stump into a terminal nerve branch entering muscle, such that the axons from the proximal nerve stump will regenerate into the muscle and thereby prevent neuroma recurrence. Regenerative peripheral nerve interfaces (RPNIs) are muscle grafts placed on the proximal nerve stumps that serve as targets for the regenerating axons from the proximal nerve stumps.\n\nWhile TMR and RPNIs have demonstrated promise for the treatment of symptomatic neuromas, prospective comparative data comparing outcomes with these two approaches is lacking.\n\nThe investigators have recently developed a novel approach to treat symptomatic neuromas that provides vascularized, denervated muscle targets (VDMTs) for the axons regenerating from the severed proximal nerve stump to reinnervate. This is accomplished by islandizing a segment of muscle on its blood supply and ensuring complete denervation prior to implanting the neighboring transected nerve stump into this muscle. VDMTs offer theoretical benefits in comparison to RPNIs and TMR that the investigators also aim to test in the proposed study.\n\nThe investigators' objective is to enroll amputees with symptomatic neuromas into a prospective study in which amputees will be randomized to undergo TMR, RPNI, or VDMT and subsequently monitored for pain and disability for 1-year post-operatively. The investigators' specific aims are as follows: 1) Test the hypothesis that VDMTs are more effective than TMR and RPNIs with regards to treating pain and disability associated with symptomatic neuromas; 2) Provide the first level one, prospective data directly comparing the efficacy of TMR and RPNIs.", "detailed_description": "Extremity amputations are common operations both in the United States and other areas of the world. It is estimated that there are nearly 2 million adults living in the United States alone. Etiologies for extremity amputation are diverse but the most common indications include complications of type 2 diabetes, non-diabetic peripheral vascular disease, trauma, and oncologic conditions. Given the increasing prevalence of several of these pathologies, conservative estimates suggest that the population of people living with an amputated limb will likely double within the next several decades.\n\nPatients who undergo limb amputation are at significant risk of developing chronic neuropathic pain as a result of symptomatic neuroma formation, due in large part to the abundance of sizeable nerves within the extremities that are necessarily transected as part of the procedure. There are two distinct forms of pain experienced by patients who have undergone major extremity amputations. Residual limb pain is the more straightforward form of post-amputation pain attributable to neuroma formation within the amputation stump. Following peripheral nerve transection, axons regenerating from the proximal stump tend to form aggregates of disorganized neural growth called neuromas. Some neuromas will produce severe, intractable pain causing significant impairment in prosthetic fit and function, activities of daily living, and quality of life. Some estimates place the prevalence of residual limb pain attributable to neuroma formation as high as 75%. The other form of pain is known as phantom limb pain. While the underpinnings of phantom limb pain are the subject of ongoing debate, it is thought by many to arise from chronic stimulation of the cerebral cortex with painful inputs from peripheral neuromas, leading to unpredictable and poorly characterized reorganization of the cortex. Informed estimates of phantom limb pain prevalence as high as 85% have been reported. Successful prevention and treatment of symptomatic neuromas in the setting of limb amputation is therefore of paramount importance given the central role in the pathogenesis of chronic post-amputation limb pain encompassing both residual limb pain and phantom limb pain.\n\nTreatment options for chronic post amputation pain caused by symptomatic neuromas are diverse. Medical options for both phantom limb pain and residual limb pain have been met with limited success. Despite the widespread use, the utility of neuromodulating medications, such as gabapentin, has been called into question by recent large scale meta-analyses that failed to demonstrate meaningful improvements. Neurotoxins, such as botulinum toxin, have also been studied and found to offer limited, if any, pain resolution.\n\nOne of the most commonly used surgical approaches to treat and prevent symptomatic neuromas involves burying the proximal nerve stump into nearby muscle. There is a widely-held misconception that burying a proximal nerve stump into muscle will prevent a neuroma from forming. However, elegant animal studies have proven that regeneration of a neuroma is virtually guaranteed because innervated muscle will not accept additional innervation from regenerating neurons.\n\nIn the past decade, two other surgical treatments for chronic post-amputation limb pain have come into vogue. Targeted muscle reinnervation (TMR) was initially pioneered as a means of providing intuitive control of advanced prostheses and only later observed to reduce neuroma pain. TMR involves transferring the proximal nerve stump of the injured nerve into a nearby distal motor branch. Early results are promising. A recently published randomized, controlled trial demonstrated the superiority of the TMR approach over the 'bury in muscle' approach, so much so that the trial concluded prematurely due to the superiority of the TMR compared to the historical technique.\n\nThe other recently developed and widely popularized option for surgical treatment of chronic post-amputation limb pain involves creation of a regenerative peripheral nerve interface (RPNI). Similar to TMR, the RPNI was initially conceived as a method to provide an interface with an advanced neuroprosthetic prior to being employed as a treatment strategy for neuromas. RPNIs are muscle grafts that are coapted to the ends of severed proximal nerve stumps. This technique has gained popularity because of its technical simplicity and promising early clinical data. In contrast to the 'bury in muscle' approach, RPNIs are denervated at the time of harvest and have been shown to accept reinnervation via direct neurotization from the proximal nerve stump.\n\nTo address possible limitations of the strategies described above, the investigators propose using muscle targets similar to RPNIs but maintaining vascularity - a vascularized, denervated muscle target (VDMT). This is accomplished by raising a portion of muscle on a vascular leash in proximity to the transected nerve. Perforating branches from larger blood vessels that perfuse adjacent muscle can be found in abundance throughout the extremities. Any nerves traveling with the vascular leashes will be divided to ensure complete denervation of the muscle. Therefore, VDMTs will be receptive to reinnervation from the implanted proximal nerve stump, maintain vascularity such that the VDMTs can be large enough to supply an abundance of sensory receptors (spindle cells, Golgi apparati, etc) to accept regenerating axons, and avoid the use of a nerve coaptation. In short, the VDMT offers possible enhancements to the surgical techniques currently in use.\n\nIn terms of surgical outcomes, there is a robust body of data surrounding the TMR and RPNI operations, with some more recent reports providing pre- and post-operative pain scores for the individual operations. With the exception of one study that prospectively compared TMR to the historical gold standard of neuroma excision and implantation into surrounding tissue, there is a startling lack of prospective data on pain outcomes. Furthermore, the investigators are not aware of prospective, head-to-head comparative data for RPNI vs TMR. Robust, prospective, comparative data is now needed to validate the VDMT approach and assess its efficacy in comparison to the other established techniques.\n\nIt is of prime importance to surgeons who perform extremity amputations (eg orthopedic surgeons, vascular surgeons, trauma surgeons, plastic surgeons, and podiatrists) as well as those who perform salvage procedures for post-amputation extremity pain to understand the potential of these operations in treating this pain. Physicians are still lacking evidence-based treatment guidelines. With the generation of this data, surgeons and patients can make more informed decisions about which operative intervention provides the highest likelihood of durable, significant pain relief.", "eligibility_criteria": "Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Age \\> 18 years\n* Patients presenting with \\> 6 months of intractable post-amputation limb pain with no history of previous surgical intervention for pain treatment.\n* Patient is able to sign informed consent and able to participate in all testing associated with this clinical investigation\n* Women of childbearing potential who have a negative pregnancy test\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Age \\< 18 years old\n* Patient unable to sign informed consent\n* Patient participating in another investigational device, surgical technique, or pharmacological study\n* Prisoner or patient from vulnerable populations as defined in 45 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 46.", "minimum_age": "18 Years", "maximum_age": "", "sex": "ALL", "healthy_volunteers": false, "type": "protocol", "filename": "clinical_trial_NCT04204668.html", "text": "NCT ID: NCT04204668\n\nTitle: A Randomized Trial Comparing Surgical Treatments for Neuroma Pain in Amputees\n\nStatus: WITHDRAWN\n\n\nBrief Summary:\nAmputees often suffer from relentless pain and disability resulting from symptomatic neuromas within the amputation stumps. When conservative measures fail to address these symptoms, two contemporary surgical approaches to treat symptomatic neuromas have become the most popular. Targeted muscle reinnervation (TMR) is a procedure which involves transferring the injured proximal nerve stump into a terminal nerve branch entering muscle, such that the axons from the proximal nerve stump will regenerate into the muscle and thereby prevent neuroma recurrence. Regenerative peripheral nerve interfaces (RPNIs) are muscle grafts placed on the proximal nerve stumps that serve as targets for the regenerating axons from the proximal nerve stumps.\n\nWhile TMR and RPNIs have demonstrated promise for the treatment of symptomatic neuromas, prospective comparative data comparing outcomes with these two approaches is lacking.\n\nThe investigators have recently developed a novel approach to treat symptomatic neuromas that provides vascularized, denervated muscle targets (VDMTs) for the axons regenerating from the severed proximal nerve stump to reinnervate. This is accomplished by islandizing a segment of muscle on its blood supply and ensuring complete denervation prior to implanting the neighboring transected nerve stump into this muscle. VDMTs offer theoretical benefits in comparison to RPNIs and TMR that the investigators also aim to test in the proposed study.\n\nThe investigators' objective is to enroll amputees with symptomatic neuromas into a prospective study in which amputees will be randomized to undergo TMR, RPNI, or VDMT and subsequently monitored for pain and disability for 1-year post-operatively. The investigators' specific aims are as follows: 1) Test the hypothesis that VDMTs are more effective than TMR and RPNIs with regards to treating pain and disability associated with symptomatic neuromas; 2) Provide the first level one, prospective data directly comparing the efficacy of TMR and RPNIs.\n\n\nDetailed Description:\nExtremity amputations are common operations both in the United States and other areas of the world. It is estimated that there are nearly 2 million adults living in the United States alone. Etiologies for extremity amputation are diverse but the most common indications include complications of type 2 diabetes, non-diabetic peripheral vascular disease, trauma, and oncologic conditions. Given the increasing prevalence of several of these pathologies, conservative estimates suggest that the population of people living with an amputated limb will likely double within the next several decades.", "scraped_at": "2026-01-19T00:14:35.033115+00:00", "source": "ClinicalTrials"}

The ability of AMD3100 to augment the antileukemic effect of chemotherapy and stem cell transplantation in patients with MDS or with AML in first or subsequent relapse, second or greater remission or primary induction failure will be assessed.\n\nThe primary objective in Stage 1 is to determine an acceptably safe dose, utilizing the continual reassessment method (CRM).The CRM is a model-based statistical procedure for conducting phase I clinical trials that assigns doses to successive cohorts of patients based on the doses given and outcomes observed (toxicity or no toxicity) of all previous patients. In this sense, the method is \"outcome-adaptive.\" The CRM relies on a simple Bayesian model for the probability of toxicity as a function of dose. As the dose-toxicity data in the trial accumulate the Bayesian model \"learns\" about the relationship between dose and probability of toxicity. Numerous computer simulation studies (and the references therein) have shown that the CRM has greatly superior properties compared to conventional \"3+3\" algorithms. This is due to the facts that conventional algorithms are not model-based, they only use data from the most recent 6 patients, and they tend to stop the trial very early, with the consequences that they are very likely to give very unreliable estimates of the toxicity probability at each dose and provide an unreliable recommended maximum tolerated dose (MTD).\n\nUnder the particular version of the CRM being used in this trial, following treatment of the first cohort of three patients at the initial dose level 80 µg/kg, the following decisions are possible:\n\n* If 0 of the first 3 patients (#1, 2 and 3) experience toxicity, then the method will escalate and the second cohort of patients (#4, 5 and 6) will be treated at the second dose level, 160 µg/kg.\n* If either 1 or 2 of the first 3 patients experience toxicity, then the method will stay at the starting dose, so the second cohort will be treated at the lowest dose level, 80 µg/kg.\n* If all 3 of the first 3 patients experience toxicity, then the posterior probability that the lowest dose is unacceptably toxic will be 0.951, and since this exceeds the decision cut-off 0.90 in the protocol the phase I trial will be terminated with the conclusion that the lowest dose level 80 µg/kg is excessively toxic.\n\nIf the trial continues, for all successive cohorts after the first, since the decision of which dose to assign utilizes all of the dose-toxicity data from all patients treated previously, there are too many possibilities to enumerate. For example, there are 12 possible outcomes for the second cohort, and this number increases exponentially as the trial progresses. However, at any point in the trial, the estimated probability of toxicity at each dose based on the most recent data may easily be estimated and this information made available to the investigators. Additional safety provisions are that the middle dose of 160 µg/kg may not be skipped when initially escalating from 80 µg/kg, and the trial will be terminated early with no dose chosen if the lowest dose is excessively toxic.\n\nThe primary objective in Stage 2 is to determine progression free survival post-allogeneic transplant, in terms of time to treatment failure and survival. Stage 1 will include both prognostic subgroups CR and not in complete remission (NCR).

Anecdotal reports have indicated improvement with pulsatile IV insulin in patients otherwise resistant to all conventional therapies. Significant complications produce painful peripheral dysesthesias, loss of sensation and gastroparesis. This study is designed to test the effectiveness of pulsatile insulin delivery on diabetic neuropathy.", "detailed_description": "Diabetic neuropathy (DN) is a progressive complication causing serious problems in 25%-40% of diabetic patients. Significant complications produce painful peripheral dysesthesias, loss of sensation, and gastroparesis. DN may affect the peripheral motor and sensory nerves in addition to the autonomic nervous system (1-3). Treatment strategies for patients with DN have generally concentrated on pain relief, without addressing the underlying pathophysiology of the disease (4). Anecdotal reports from patients treated with pulsatile insulin for other complications suggest that this treatment may show efficacy in patients with DN. This study is designed to compare patients with DN who receive pulsatile insulin with a control group.\n\nPulses of IV insulin encourages the glucose metabolism in diabetics to normalize in multiple organs, especially muscle, retina, liver, kidney and nerve endings. The process fundamentally requires the administration of high dose insulin pulses similar to those found in non diabetic humans by their pancreas into the surrounding portal circulation. Oral carbohydrates are given simultaneously to augment the process and prevent hypoglycemia. The process is monitored by frequent measuring of glucose levels and respiratory quotients (RQ). RQ is measured by a metabolic cart which determines the ratio VCO2/ VO2. This ratio is specific for the fuel used at any one time by the body. The glucose levels are monitored to keep glucose levels appropriate and the RQ determines the need to readjust the infusion protocol in each patient for subsequent insulin infusion sessions. The insulin pulses are delivered over 1-hour periods with a 1-hour rest period between each session. Three treatments are given during each treatment day.\n\nThe respiratory quotient (RQ) is a measurement of CO2 exhaled and O2 inhaled and is proportionate to the fuel sources being used by the body, primarily the liver over short periods of time. The higher the RQ, the more glucose and less alternative fuel sources are being utilized. Following the RQ change helps determine the effectiveness of physiological insulin administration in increasing anabolic functions in diabetic individuals. By improving the body's glucose metabolism and thereby causing beneficial effects of anabolic factors, the possibility of serious complications can be decreased. In addition the use of oral carbohydrate at the same time along with the physiologic insulin administration stimulates the appropriate gut hormones which augment this effect, a response which cannot be duplicated with intravenous glucose. The purpose of our studies is to determine whether the physiologic administration of insulin along with the augmenting effect of oral carbohydrates will normalize metabolism in diabetic patients and correlate with an improvement in their manifestations of diabetic neuropathy.\n\nThe RQ is determined by the use of a metabolic cart. Individuals breathe into a mask for 3-5 minutes after a rest period of 30 or more minutes. The ratio of exhaled volume of CO2 to the inhaled volume of O2 is determined as the RQ. The physiologic range is 0.7 to1.3. Individuals using fat as a primary fuel have a ratio of 0.7, protein or mixed fuels is 0.8-0.9 and carbohydrate is 0.9-1.0. Those taking excessive calories will have RQ's higher than 1.05.\n\n1.

Further, it constitutes the main cause of cancer-related deaths. Among the lung cancer types, non-small cell lung cancer represents 80-85% of cases, and the majority of patients are diagnosed with locally advanced or metastatic disease, and 5-year survival rates remain discouraging in most world regions, ranging from 8-18%.\n\nAdvances in molecular biology have led to the discovery of several molecular targets and development of targeted therapy for patients with specific molecular subtypes of NSCLC. One of the most widely studied is the epidermic growth factor receptor (EGFR), which has been long recognized as a key modulator for specific tumor cell functions, and thus it has been used in drug development strategies.\n\nMutations in the EGFR gene are reported in 15% of all NSCLC cases, though incidence varies widely and in Mexico up to 34% of patients present with tumors with EGFR mutations. Treatment of patients with tumors with these characteristics is based on specific tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), achieving higher objective response rates and improved progression-free survival (PFS) compared with chemotherapy-based schemes. Nonetheless, despite the initial response, most patients treated with TKIs will eventually develop resistance mechanisms and present progressive disease. Consequently, the development of novel strategies to overcome TKI resistance and improve PFS of patients with NSCLC with epidermic growth factor receptor mutations (EGFRm) is priority.\n\nUp to 30% of patients with NSCLC present with somatic mutations in the liver kinase B1 (LKB1) gene, which acts as a tumor suppressor through inhibition of mammilian target of rapamycin (mTOR). In a study which included 24 patients with LKB1 expression who received treatment with metformin + TKIs, overall survival was improved significantly, and therefore it is important to evaluate LKB1 expression in addition to mutations which could be related with treatment response in patients given metformin plus antineoplastic agents. LKB1 can activate AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling through specific phosphorylations at aminoacid residues. AMPK can regulate cell cycle, cell proliferation and cell survival in NSCLC. Recently, the loss of expression of LKB1 has been associated with a reduced activation in AMPK using in vivo models, and increase in tumor necrosis after treatment with bevacizumab. The expression of AMPK has also been evaluated in NSCLC, a study which included 99 samples concluded that increased AMPK expression was associated with worse overall survival. Nonetheless, the association between AMPK expression and metformin treatment has not been ascertained.\n\nMetformin is a biguanide used as treatment for type 2 diabetes. Additionally, several studies have identified a reduced incidence and mortality from diverse neoplasms in patients treated with metformin. In vitro studies have shown that metformin is cytotoxic in lung adenocarcinoma cells, producing a cell cycle arrest at G0 and G1, and it inhibits resistance to TKIs induced by Epithelial-Mesenchymal transition (EMT). Retrospective trials have also provided evidence as to the benefit of metformin in patients undergoing treatment for NSCLC. Several prospective trials have evaluated the concurrent use of metformin plus TKIs for patients with lung adenocarcinoma, though results have been controversial.\n\nThis randomized, phase 3 study will evaluate the PFS in patients with NSCLC with EGFR mutations undergoing treatment with TKIs plus placebo vs. TKIs plus metformin.", "detailed_description": "", "eligibility_criteria": "Inclusion Criteria:\n\n1.

{"nct_id": "NCT01597791", "title": "Do Women Receiving Low Dose Combined Spinal Epidural for Labor Analgesia Exhibit Less Bacteriuria Using a Urinary Retention Protocol Versus Routine Urinary Catheter Placement?", "status": "TERMINATED", "brief_summary": "The investigators hypothesize that many parturients can, in fact, spontaneously micturate with low dose combined spinal epidural analgesic doses given for labor and that Foley catheterization is unnecessary in the majority of these parturients. At Prentice Women's Hospital, almost 9000 women annually receive neuraxial labor analgesia and 98% of those receive Foley catheters. By potentially reducing the necessity for Foley catheters, the investigators should be able to ultimately reduce the rate of bacteriuria, urinary tract infections and urethritis leading to unnecessary treatment with antibiotics, as well as reduce costs of placing unnecessary Foley catheter.The hypothesis is parturients receiving low dose combined spinal epidural analgesia for analgesia after induction of labor who are randomized to a spontaneous micturition protocol will require fewer Foley catheter placements and demonstrate a lower incidence of positive urine culture postpartum than those who undergo standard Foley catheter placement.", "detailed_description": "Participation in the study will begin at the patient's request for labor analgesia. The patient will be asked to urinate and a post void residual (PVR) will be measured via ultrasonography. If the PVR is \\>100mL, the patient will be excluded from the study. If CSF is not obtained during CSE placement or the CSE technique is abandoned for any other reason, the patient will be excluded. If the PVR is \\< 100mL and the combined spinal epidural analgesia is successful, they will be randomized to receive either routine Foley catheter placement or begin the spontaneous micturition protocol. Last cervical exam and VRS pain will be recorded at this time.\n\nSubjects will be prepared in the usual fashion for the combined spinal epidural with hemodynamic monitoring and intravenous (IV) access.\n\nThe anesthesiologist will perform a combined spinal epidural analgesia per routine with the subject in the sitting position using sterile technique at the L3-4 interspace (± one vertebral interspace). The epidural space will be found using loss of resistance technique with either 3 mL of air or saline and a 17G Touhy needle. After the epidural space is identified, the dura will be punctured with a 27G Pencan and 2.5mg of plain bupivacaine + 15 μg fentanyl will be injected. The epidural catheter will be inserted to 3-5cm into the epidural space and a test dose of 3 mL of 1.5% lidocaine + 1:200,000 epinephrine will be injected. The epidural catheter will be secured and the PCEA initiated with the standard infusion rate and patient administered boluses using 0.06% bupivacaine + 2mcg/mL fentanyl. Post-procedure vital signs will be monitored in the usual fashion.\n\nPatients randomized to the control group will have a Foley catheter placed after the CSE is performed as is the usual practice at this institution. Their bladder volume will be assessed via ultrasonography before Foley catheter placement. The volume of urine collected in the Foley bag will be used to validate our ultrasonographic measurements.\n\nPatients randomized to the spontaneous micturition algorithm will be assessed for spontaneous micturition and post void residual (PVR) volumes via ultrasonography at regular time intervals. First, the patient's bladder volume is measured via ultrasonography; this is followed by an attempt at spontaneous micturition. The patient will have an attempt at spontaneous micturition only if their bladder contains \\>100mL of urine. This ensures inability to micturate is not due to insufficient urine in the bladder prior to their attempt. An ultrasonographic measurement of their postvoid residual volume will follow their attempt to spontaneously micturate, to ensure the patient does not have urinary retention necessitating Foley catheter placement.\n\nThe first attempt at spontaneous micturition is two hours after the spinal analgesic dose is injected. A study by Campbell et al. demonstrated no urinary retention with this intrathecal dose, but it is a possibility that the spinal dose may still be present and have a differing effect than the epidural analgesic dose. As a result of this possibility, we decided that if a patient has urinary retention at this first attempt, 2 hours post injection of the spinal dose, they will have a straight catheterization and be given another chance at spontaneous micturition more than 3 hours after the spinal dose was injected. This ensures the spinal dose has completely worn off and the epidural analgesic dose is in effect before committing the patient to a bed pan or Foley catheter.\n\nMost patients will be evaluated at least twice for ability to spontaneously micturate and have their PVR volumes accessed via ultrasonography before being assigned to either a bed pan every 2 hours or a Foley catheter placement. If the patient is able to spontaneously micturate twice and their PVR is \\<100mL, they will be assigned to a bed pan every 2 hours. If a patient is unable to micturate with a PVR \\>100mL, they will receive a Foley catheter.\n\nThe spontaneous micturition algorithm allows for a maximum of 3 attempts at micturition before a patient is committed to either a bed pan every 2 hours or Foley catheter placement. In the event that a patient is able to spontaneously micturate but has incomplete bladder emptying with a PVR 100-250mL, they will be allowed to continue in the algorithm for a third and final attempt at spontaneous micturition. If the patient is able to spontaneously micturate at this last attempt with a PVR volume \\<100mL, they will be assigned to a bed pan every 2 hours but if their PVR remains \\>100mL they will have a Foley catheter placed.\n\nOn occasion, patients need a rescue bolus of higher concentration local anesthetic during labor for breakthrough pain. If this occurs, the usual rebolus dose of up to 15mL of bupivacaine 0.125% will be given in incremental doses titrated to patient comfort. Following this rebolus, the infusion rate will be increased to 20ml/hr as is the usual practice. If a patient who was previously assigned to use a bed pan every 2 hours requires a rescue bolus of local anesthetic, their ability to spontaneously micturate will be reassessed 2 hours following the rebolus to evaluate for need for reassignment to Foley catheter placement with the higher doses of bupivacaine.\n\nIf a patient who was assigned to use a bed pan every 2 hours requires a second rebolus, they will receive another rebolus dose of up to 15mL of bupivacaine 0.125%, the concentration of the epidural bupivacaine infusion will be increased to bupivacaine 0.11% + fentanyl 2mcg/mL as is our usual practice and they will automatically be assigned to a Foley catheter placement.\n\nIf a study patient requires a cesarean delivery, a Foley catheter will be inserted at time of decision for cesarean delivery and removed 24 hours post procedure as is the standard practice at our institution.\n\nThe primary outcome (rate of positive urine culture) of this study will be assessed by collecting a twenty-four to forty-eight hour midstream urine sample and performing a urine culture. The clinical and laboratory criteria used to define a urinary tract infection in a woman immediately postpartum is unknown. If the patient is considered uncomplicated (normal female urinary physiology) then she would be treated only if she has symptoms. If the patient is considered complicated (pregnant urinary physiology) then she would be treated for bacterial growth on urine culture even if asymptomatic. For this reason and for the purpose of this study, if the patient is asymptomatic for urinary tract infection but has a positive urine culture with 50,000 colony-forming units (CFU)/mL of bacteria, the patient's obstetrician will be notified and they will likely be treated with antibiotics for suspected urinary tract infection. This is more conservative than the current guidelines for asymptomatic bacteriuria in pregnancy. If a positive urine culture is identified and patients is symptomatic (at least1 sign/symptom) with the number of colonies of bacteria exceed 10,000 CFU/ml, the obstetrician will be notified and they may be treated with antibiotics for suspected urinary tract infection. This is more conservative than the guidelines for catheter-related infections.\n\nIn addition to the primary outcome data, the following information will be collected after delivery: satisfaction with bladder treatment protocol (100 mm scale, 0 mm = not satisfied at all, 100 mm = very satisfied), total labor duration, length of stage 2, mode of delivery, presence and degree of lacerations, fetal weight, duration of Foley catheterization, time to first spontaneous void following delivery or Foley catheter removal, total fluids administered during labor and total dose of epidural analgesics.\n\nIn addition, a postvoid residual (PVR) will be assess via ultrasound at 8-24 hours following delivery or foley catheter removal to assess for postpartum urinary retention. If the PVR is found to be \\>100mL postpartum, this will be considered urinary retention and the obstetrician and co-investigator (urogynecologist) will be notified.\n\nThe following demographic data will also be collected: maternal age, height, weight, pre-pregnancy weight, and gestational age.\n\nOne telephone follow-up evaluation 8 weeks after delivery, the patient will be assessed for treatment of urinary tract infection and urinary retention during or after discharge from the hospital.", "eligibility_criteria": "Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Nulliparous\n* Term (≥37 week gestation)\n* Healthy\n* ASA class 1-2\n* Who are being induced for labor who request labor analgesia and who successfully receive standard combined spinal epidural analgesia (verbal rating score for pain ≤ 1 after 10 min)\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Women with ASA 3 or greater\n* BMI ≥40 kg/m2\n* Prior history of urge or stress incontinence or urinary retention before pregnancy\n* Women with a history of nephrolithiasis\n* Chronic urinary tract infections\n* Women whose post-void residual volume as assessed by ultrasonography is found to be \\>100ml before epidural placement will be excluded.\n* Women with an absolute or relative contraindication to the usual combined spinal epidural technique\n* Failed analgesia will be excluded\n* Women for whom the anesthesiologist selects an analgesic technique other than combined spinal epidural technique or fail to obtain CSF for CSE will be excluded\n* Women with fetal heart rate decelerations before request for analgesia will be excluded due to increased risk of cesarean delivery.\n* Women who experience inadequate labor analgesia due to nonfunctioning epidural catheter necessitating epidural replacement will be included but noted as a protocol violation.", "minimum_age": "18 Years", "maximum_age": "", "sex": "FEMALE", "healthy_volunteers": false, "type": "protocol", "filename": "clinical_trial_NCT01597791.html", "text": "NCT ID: NCT01597791\n\nTitle: Do Women Receiving Low Dose Combined Spinal Epidural for Labor Analgesia Exhibit Less Bacteriuria Using a Urinary Retention Protocol Versus Routine Urinary Catheter Placement?\n\nStatus: TERMINATED\n\n\nBrief Summary:\nThe investigators hypothesize that many parturients can, in fact, spontaneously micturate with low dose combined spinal epidural analgesic doses given for labor and that Foley catheterization is unnecessary in the majority of these parturients.

{"nct_id": "NCT02624674", "title": "Multi-spectral Imaging to Assess Wounds in Peripheral Vascular Disease Patients", "status": "UNKNOWN", "brief_summary": "Peripheral vascular disease (PVD) is a common disease of impaired blood flow resulting in the compromised tissue perfusion of lower limbs. PAD patients can experience pain, diminished exercise capacity, and tissue loss, with some ultimately requiring amputation. The economic burden of PVD is significant. In the United States alone, PVD accounts for over $20 billion in annual healthcare related costs.\n\nThe demand for the development of an effective method to characterize the viability of PVD wounds has resulted in the emergence of several innovative techniques. Commonly used diagnostic methods are ankle-brachial index (ABI), pulse volume recordings, duplex ultrasonography, venous plethysmography, Transcutaneous oxygen tension (TcPO2), toe pressures, angiography by X-ray, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging. Currently, angiography remains the diagnostic gold standard. However, many of these techniques lack the ability to triage and adequately determine the viability of the wound. In addition, there remains a need for effective triage technologies to help clinicians decide whether surgical management is needed. Early determination of surgical versus conservative management may help to improve patient functional outcomes, reduce mortality rates, and prevent limb amputation.\n\nNear-infrared point spectroscopy (NIRS) is a non-invasively technology with recent applications in PVD wound assessment. To date, studies have demonstrated the validity of NIRS technology in patients with peripheral arterial disease. NIRS measures flow, concentration, and oxygenation of hemoglobin in arterioles, capillaries, and venules several centimeters deep in tissue. The MSID is an evolution of existing NIRS imaging devices and has become a portable and functional commercial device produced by KENT imaging (Calgary, Canada). Using this new and clinically applicable NIRS technology designed for assessing wound perfusion and oxygenation, this study seeks to adequately identify viable from non-viable wounds and to rapidly determine indication for vascular interventions. This technology is well-suited for use in a wound patient population as the measurements times are short and can quickly be used at the patient bed side. As such, this project intends to apply NIR technology to quickly assess PVD in the investigators' patient population.", "detailed_description": "Peripheral vascular disease (PVD) is a common disease of the elderly, resulting in the compromise of blood flow to the lower limbs. As a consequence of impaired tissue perfusion, PAD patients can experience pain, diminished exercise capacity, and tissue loss, with some ultimately requiring amputation. Globally, lower extremity peripheral artery disease is the third leading cause of atherosclerotic cardiovascular morbidity, affecting over 200 million individuals worldwide. Peripheral vascular disease is becoming more prevalent with the increase of incidence with age and a globally aging population. In 2010, it was estimated that the number of people living with peripheral artery disease increased by 23.5% in the last decade. The economic burden of PVD is significant. In the United States alone, PVD accounts for over $20 billion in annual healthcare related costs. Specifically, non-healing wounds represent a significant portion of this expenditure at more than $3 billion per year.\n\nThe demand for the development of an effective method to characterize the viability of PVD wounds has resulted in the emergence of several innovative techniques. Commonly used diagnostic methods are ankle-brachial index (ABI), pulse volume recordings, duplex ultrasonography, venous plethysmography, angiography by X-ray, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging. However, many of these techniques lack the ability to triage and adequately determine the viability of the wound. Ankle brachial index (ABI) is one of the most common screening techniques used to establish the presence of PVD, but it lacks sensitivity in creating sensitive and specific categorization of wounds as viable or non-viable. ABI gives an indication of a hemodynamically significant obstruction, but does not measure blood flow directly. Doppler ultrasound is another common method that can measure arterial blood flow, however some groups suggest that the femoral artery blood flow may not be an accurate hemodynamic indication of muscle ischemia. Magnetic resonance spectroscopy is also a new technique that has been validated in its application to assess PVD. Novel magnetic imaging sequences such as PIVOT (Perfusion, Intravascular Venous Oxygen Saturation) combine Blood Oxygen Level Dependent (BOLD) MRI and Arterial Spin Labeling (ASL) to comprehensively assess the tissue. Despite the strengths that many MRI techniques promise, clinical use limitations remain due to the high costs and availability of resources.\n\nPeripheral vascular disease-induced lower extremity wounds have inadequate perfusion. Currently, there are three major approaches to improve vascular perfusion to the area: medical management, open surgery, and endovascular surgery. Medical management consists of lifestyle modification and management of associated risk factors such as smoking, diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, and hypercoagulability. While advances have been made in the medical management of lower extremity ischemia-induced wounds, large arterial revascularization remains the current standard of care. Open bypass surgery is often employed to bypass stenotic arteries and improve perfusion to lower extremity wounds. Over the last two decades, endovascular intervention has emerged as an additional therapy as it is minimally invasive and may have lower associated morbidity and mortality. In addition to improved perfusion of lower extremity wounds by medical management of surgical intervention, local wound care is required to expedite the healing process and prevent infection.\n\nHowever, there remains a need for effective triage technologies to help clinicians decide whether surgical management is needed. This would allow for early determination of surgical versus conservative management and inpatient versus outpatient management. If surgery is required, patient functional outcomes are improved if it takes place earlier. As well, inpatient management of surgical patients is extremely costly. Outpatient management of patients with peripheral vascular wounds that do not require surgery would significantly reduce the costs associated with surgical intervention.\n\nNear-infrared point spectroscopy (NIRS) non-invasively measures flow, concentration, and oxygenation of hemoglobin in arterioles, capillaries, and venules several centimeters deep in tissue. NIRS is safe and comfortable for patients and is well-suited to measure markers of viability in peripheral vascular disease wounds, including tissue perfusion, oxygenation and hemoglobin. To date, studies have demonstrated the validity of NIRS technology in patients with peripheral arterial disease. The Multi spectrum infrared device (MSID) represents an important evolution of existing NIRS imaging devices, which were designed for the clinical environment. The MSID has become a commercial device produced by KENT imaging (Calgary, Canada) after several animal and clinical trials have validated its use. The MSID is a new generation of NIR imaging devices with enhanced portability and functionality. The MSID is able to monitor many variables, such as cytochrome oxidase as a marker of tissue oxygen utilization, oxygen saturation, perfusion and methemoglobin as a marker of free radical injury. The advantage of the MSID is its capacity to account for skin colour. Melanin absorbs light and attenuates the amount of NIR light received by the camera. The Kent imaging device has unique mathematical algorithms to account for melanin content of the skin. In many previous studies done with NIRS technology in PVD wounds, melanin content was not considered to be a factor as patients demographic was predominantly Caucasian. However, in many multicultural cities where there is a wide variability in patient melanin content, melanin corrections in NIRS imaging are very important.\n\nUsing this new and clinically applicable NIRS technology designed for PVD, this study seeks to identify viable from non-viable wounds and to determine the severity of wound in assessing for vascular intervention indication. This technology is well-suited for use in a wound patient population as the measurements times are short and movement of subjects is not an issue. As such, this project intends to apply novel technology that has the capacity to quickly assess wounds as a complication of PVD.", "eligibility_criteria": "Inclusion Criteria\n\n1.

PAD patients can experience pain, diminished exercise capacity, and tissue loss, with some ultimately requiring amputation. The economic burden of PVD is significant. In the United States alone, PVD accounts for over $20 billion in annual healthcare related costs.\n\nThe demand for the development of an effective method to characterize the viability of PVD wounds has resulted in the emergence of several innovative techniques. Commonly used diagnostic methods are ankle-brachial index (ABI), pulse volume recordings, duplex ultrasonography, venous plethysmography, Transcutaneous oxygen tension (TcPO2), toe pressures, angiography by X-ray, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging. Currently, angiography remains the diagnostic gold standard. However, many of these techniques lack the ability to triage and adequately determine the viability of the wound. In addition, there remains a need for effective triage technologies to help clinicians decide whether surgical management is needed. Early determination of surgical versus conservative management may help to improve patient functional outcomes, reduce mortality rates, and prevent limb amputation.\n\nNear-infrared point spectroscopy (NIRS) is a non-invasively technology with recent applications in PVD wound assessment.

Identifying and evaluating MicroEMG measurement parameters in this exploratory manner is a necessary step to evaluate its usability and design, and determine whether the microEMG system may be suitable for in-house use after further confirmative testing.", "detailed_description": "About this study We have developed a completely new multi-electrode electromyography system (MicroEMG) that we want to test in this study. It records muscle activity from multiple recording points in the muscle at once. We believe that this will increase the sensitivity of the technique in diagnosing muscle disease, reduce the time taken, and be more comfortable for patients. However, to prove whether this is the case we first need to understand the how the recorded signals of the new MicroEMG look like in different patient groups.\n\nBackground:\n\nWhy are we doing this study?\n\nElectromyography (EMG) is an essential diagnostic test for nerve and muscle diseases. Cells in the muscle generate electric potentials when they are activated. This activity can be measured by the EMG. Based on those 'patterns', experts can detect medical abnormalities, such as muscle or nerve disorders. EMG involves inserting a thin metal needle electrode through the skin into a muscle. It records changes in the pattern of electrical signals produced by the muscle fibres. In conventional EMG only a single recording surface at the tip of the needle is used and therefore only small part of muscle can be examined.\n\nWe developed a new EMG device called MicroEMG. It uses a novel type of electrode that can examine the muscle in more detail. As it records activity from several different points at the muscle at once it can produce an electrical image (rather than an abstract signal). This way a large volume of muscle can be recorded simultaneously with less movement and discomfort for the patient.\n\nWhat is the goal of this study?\n\nPatients with a disease known to affect the nerves or the muscles typically would be tested with conventional EMG. Some diseases are linked to a specific 'diagnostic pattern' in the EMG that guides the specialist's diagnosis.\n\nWe do not know these pattern for MicroEMG yet. In this study we want to look at how measurements with the new MicroEMG look like in patients with neuromuscular disease. Each patient will undergo recordings from identical muscles using both conventional EMG and microEMG during a single visit. This will allow us to relate the electrical signal patterns in the muscle measured by MicroEMG to the known diagnostic pattern we typically see in conventional EMG. We will do this in both healthy and diseased muscles. Based on that we can determine which of these patterns may be suitable as potential diagnostic markers for the MicroEMG system.\n\nWe will also ask participants about their experience as a patient. It will give us a better understanding about how patients in our hospital may benefit from the new MicroEMG device in the future (after further confirmative research).\n\nWho can participate?\n\nIn this study we want to look at how measurements with the new MicroEMG look like in patients with neuromuscular diseases - in particular, motor neurone disease, sarcopenia, post-polio syndrome, and myasthenia gravis. We also want to look at how those signals compare to signals measured in a healthy control group.\n\nParticipants will have a previously known diagnosis of any of the abovementioned diseases.\n\nNot everyone is able to take part. Important reasons why one may not be able to take part include:\n\n* Having a cardiac pacemaker or implanted defibrillator.\n* Alternative neurological disorders.\n* Lymphedema or dialysis fistula in the arms or legs.\n* Taking clotting inhibitors or having a clotting disorder.\n\nWhat does the study involve? What will I be asked to do?\n\nInitial appointment\n\n* We will ask participants to attend the Neurophysiology Department in Newcastle Hospitals NHS Trust.\n* We will ask participants to fill out a data entry form (e.g. age, gender and contact details).\n* We will ask participants basic questions about their health history to ensure they are able to take part.\n\nRecording EMG\n\n* We will perform 2 EMG exams, one with a conventional EMG needle that is normally used in our clinic. Another exam we will use the newly developed MicroEMG.\n* We will ask participants to put their phone in flight mode (if possible) and lie on a couch.\n* For each exam we will place a fine needle into in the muscles in the arms and shins (in total 5 different points). The insertion spots will be cleaned using alcohol beforehand.\n* The EMG procedures are uncomfortable and can cause a similar amount of pain to having a vaccination. They may cause some temporary bruising to the skin but have no long-term effects.\n* Each EMG exam will take approximately 30 minutes.\n* At the end of each exam, we will ask participants to fill in a short questionnaire. This is to learn about their experience of the EMG exam, any discomfort, and any suggestions for improvement.\n* We expect the entire procedure to not take longer than 2 hours.\n\nWhat are the possible benefits of taking part?\n\n* This study itself will not benefit participants. We expect the results of this study will help us decide us whether and how MicroEMG may be used as a diagnostic tool in our hospital in the future.\n* We hope that this new system will help with the future diagnosis of diseases which damage the nerves and muscles. However, to prove this systematically we need to do more research.\n\nWhat are the possible risks of taking part?\n\n* The needle test (electromyography) is uncomfortable but has no long-term effects.\n* In people with blood clotting abnormalities there is a small risk of bleeding inside the muscles. To avoid this, anyone with blood clotting problems will be excluded from the study as a precaution.\n* To control risk of infection we clean the skin with alcohol before inserting the sterile needle. After use, the needle is safely disposed.\n* In addition, our department has put in place extensive measures to ensure patient safety during the Covid-19 pandemic. These have been reviewed and approved by the hospital Infection Control Team.\n\nWho monitors this study?\n\n• The study is overseen by Newcastle Upon Tyne Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust (NuTH). It is a requirement that participant records in this research, together with any relevant medical records, be made available for scrutiny by monitors from NuTH. Their role is to check that research is properly conducted and the interests of those taking part are adequately protected.

The decrease in lung compliance, increased airway resistance (interstitial and bronchial edema) and hypoxemia will cause an increase in work of breathing. The imbalance between the ability of respiratory muscles to generate effective gas exchange and exaggerated ventilatory load can lead to respiratory muscle fatigue requiring use of mechanical ventilation through endotracheal prosthesis. In addition, the increase in inspiratory muscles work during the CPE generates very important pleural depression, which increases transmural pressure and left ventricular afterload and thus increases pulmonary edema.\n\nThe CPAP is a non-invasive ventilation mode most currently used CPE. It is usually obtained via a mask and an expiratory valve to maintain constant pressure in the circuit. No inspiratory assistance is provided to the patient. The BOUSSIGNAC valve is currently used in clinical practice as an adjunct to the pharmacological treatment of CPE.The effect of CPAP is mainly linked to its ability to recruit zones that are collapsed during expiration. • NIPSV combines a positive expiratory pressure to ventilatory assistance pressure during inspiration delivered by a ventilator. It corresponds to a CPAP associated with inspiratory assistance, and thus, it is likely to improve the ventilation parameters, and in particular to reduce respiratory work more efficiently than CPAP alone.These beneficial physiological effects of NIPSV were well demonstrated during the decompensation of COPD ; they wait to be confirmed during CPE.

As HIV-infected subjects may also be receiving methadone for opioid dependence, an evaluation of the potential interaction between DTG and methadone is warranted. The primary objective of this study is to determine whether concomitant administration of DTG can affect the pharmacokinetics (PK) of methadone. As a secondary endpoint, the PK of DTG will be compared to historical data. This study will be open-label with subjects receiving DTG and stable doses of methadone.

After meeting all eligible criterions, subjects will remain on their individual methadone dose for 3 days in period 1. In period 2, subjects will continue on their individual stable dose of methadone and will receive 50 mg DTG every 12 hours for 5 days. Pharmacokinetics will be collected on Day 3 of period 1 and Day 5 of period 2. Safety measurements will be routine chemistry, haematology and urinalysis. Pharmacodynamic parameters for pupillometry and opioid symptom questionnaire will be collected at the same timepoints as for the pharmacokinetics. Subjects will be discharged after the last PK sample has been collected. A follow-up visit will occur 7-14 days after the last dose of study drug.

Autologous dendritic cells pulsed with an allogeneic tumor lysate (MesoPher) will be administered intra-dermally and intravenously 3 times every 2 weeks. Booster vaccinations are given after 3 and 6 months. On the same day after administration of MesoPher a CD40 agonist (mitazalimab) will be administered intravenously.\n\nStudy parameters/endpoints: The main study endpoint are the dose-limiting toxicities of MesoPher/mitazalimab combination therapy. The secondary endpoints are the induced immune responses on therapy and the radiographical response rate according to RECIST and iRECIST.\n\nNature and extent of the burden and risks associated with participation, benefit and group relatedness: Patients have to undergo additional outpatient clinic visits for this study and additional invasive procedures specifically for this trial, e.g. intravenous catheter placement and tumor metastasis biopsies. Although these are invasive procedures, associated risks are limited. Intravenous access is necessary during every visit, i.e. for leukapheresis, for drawing blood samples and for the administration of study medication. Leukapheresis is a standard procedure and will be performed according to our institutional guidelines. Leukapheresis demonstrates a limited risk for transient thrombocytopenia and leukopenia. Previous clinical studies have shown that injection with tumor lysate-pulsed dendritic cells (MesoPher) was well tolerated without major systemic toxicity, with the exception of low-grade flu-like symptoms (REACtiVE Trial, NL67169.000.18; DENIM/MM04: NCT03610360; MM03 NL44330.000.14 / NCT02395679).\n\nAlso, intravenous injection of mitazalimab up to 1200 µg/kg was well tolerated with manageable side effects. There are currently no trials investigating this combination therapy. Combining two immunomodulatory drugs increases the risk for toxicity.

Different types of PRCC have been described on the basis of two histologic subtypes, type 1 in 25 to 30% cases, and type 2, with a worse prognosis reported for type 2 metastatic disease. There is currently no standard of care specifically dedicated to metastatic PRCC patients (mPRCC) and treatments developed for metastatic clear cell carcinomas are commonly used ; therefore, mPRCC enrollment in clinical trials is encouraged.\n\nClinical trials investigated treatments such as sunitinib, or everolimus approved for advanced clear cell carcinoma, or the dual kinase inhibitor directed both towards VEGF receptors (VEGFr) and the MET pathway foretinib, or more recently, the selective MET inhibitor savolitinib.

{"nct_id": "NCT02566590", "title": "Preventing the Loss of Muscle and Function in Hospitalized Older Adults", "status": "COMPLETED", "brief_summary": "One third of independent older adults over the age of 65y will be hospitalized for an acute medical illness, injury, or operative procedure. Unfortunately, 50% of these older adults will experience functional decline during their hospital stay from the amount of time they are physically inactive and in bed. Following discharge, the functional deficits can persist for months and in many instances never return to pre-hospitalization levels thus compounding morbidity, health care costs and dying. A classic consequence of short-term bed rest in older adults is the significant loss in skeletal muscle mass which underlies the accelerated leg strength deficits. The investigator has shown that an important mechanism of skeletal muscle loss is the inability of nutrients to stimulate a normal muscle protein synthesis response; a process highly regulated by the mammalian target of rapamycin signaling pathway (mTOR) and amino acid transporters. Day to day maintenance of force generating muscle tissue is dictated by anabolic stimulation from muscle contraction and essential amino acid ingestion. Therefore, anabolic interventions such as neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) and high quality protein supplementation that contains a high proportion of essential amino acids (whey protein) may be promising approach to maintain leg muscle mass and strength in hospitalized older adults and prevent the long term consequences of repeated periods of short-term physical inactivity. The purpose of this study is to test in older adults if the combination of NMES and protein supplementation is capable of preserving muscle mass and strength and maintaining muscle nutrient anabolic sensitivity during bed rest. The investigators current hypotheses are that daily NMES and protein supplementation during 5-days of bed rest in older adults will: 1) preserve lower extremity muscle mass and strength and 2) maintain muscle nutrient anabolic sensitivity as measured by mTOR signaling and amino acid transporter expression. The long term goal is to utilize this inpatient preventative therapeutic approach in a clinical setting in which muscle mass and strength deficits are profound (e.g., intensive care patients).", "detailed_description": "A majority of older adults experience repeated periods of physical inactivity during acute illnesses, injuries or after an operative procedure. Following discharge from the hospital, daily activities are adversely impacted. Infirmity follows repeated periods of inactivity (termed \"catabolic hits\") that can occur over an older adults' lifespan and lead to a downward spiral of potentially irrecoverable deficits in physical function resulting in increased health care costs, loss of independence, and premature death. The hallmark sign of short-term physical inactivity in older adults is the rapid deterioration of skeletal muscle mass and strength. Understandably, little attention is placed on physical function during these requisite periods of inactivity as the medical management and/or postoperative recuperation is the focus. However, the muscle deficits that follow as a result of acute hospitalization can have profound long-term consequences.\n\nMuscle contraction and essential amino acids are powerful independent anabolic stimuli and fundamental to maintain skeletal muscle mass and strength. The primary mechanism of disuse atrophy during short-term bed rest in older adults is the reduced acute nutrient stimulation of muscle protein synthesis regulated by the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway and amino acid transporter expression (i.e., LAT1). Intervening with essential amino acid supplements can maintain some muscle function in older adults during bed rest, but it does not preserve muscle mass. Neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) as a muscle intervention is also feasible, but alone is not a panacea. NMES has recently been shown to acutely stimulate protein synthesis in ambulatory older adults with diabetes and attenuate some loss in muscle mass in critically ill patients. The investigator suggests that, together, daily NMES, and a high quality protein source of EAAs (PRO), can be a potent two-pronged approach to preserve the loss of muscle and strength in older adults confined to short-term bed rest. The goal is to test if the combination of NMES and PRO will maintain muscle mass, strength, nutrient-induced mTOR signaling and amino acid transporter expression in older adults during bed rest. The central hypothesis for this project which will support this next step is that a daily combination of NMES and PRO in older adults experiencing bed rest will preserve: 1) leg muscle mass and knee extensor strength and 2) muscle anabolic sensitivity in response to acute nutrient ingestion, as measured by mTOR signaling and LAT1 expression.", "eligibility_criteria": "Inclusion Criteria:\n\nAge between 60-85 yrs Ability to sign informed consent Montreal cognitive assessment (MOCA) exam score ≥26 Free-living, prior to admission\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n1.

Unfortunately, 50% of these older adults will experience functional decline during their hospital stay from the amount of time they are physically inactive and in bed. Following discharge, the functional deficits can persist for months and in many instances never return to pre-hospitalization levels thus compounding morbidity, health care costs and dying. A classic consequence of short-term bed rest in older adults is the significant loss in skeletal muscle mass which underlies the accelerated leg strength deficits. The investigator has shown that an important mechanism of skeletal muscle loss is the inability of nutrients to stimulate a normal muscle protein synthesis response; a process highly regulated by the mammalian target of rapamycin signaling pathway (mTOR) and amino acid transporters. Day to day maintenance of force generating muscle tissue is dictated by anabolic stimulation from muscle contraction and essential amino acid ingestion.

{"nct_id": "NCT06738290", "title": "Predicting Motor Learning of an Upper Limb Task Based on Behavioral and Disease-specific Characteristics in Patients With Parkinson's Disease", "status": "COMPLETED", "brief_summary": "Manual dexterity deficits and loss of motor automaticity are commonly seen in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). Amongst these problems, using a touchscreen is becoming increasingly burdensome. In addition, a variety of non-motor symptoms, including cognitive impairment have a significant impact on the quality of life of patients with PD which will also affect the use of mobile devices. As the degradation of dopaminergic neurons in the striatum results in an impaired capacity for motor learning and more specifically for consolidation in motor memory, the investigators want to unravel the remaining rehabilitation potential in this patient group. Recent work on the consolidation of an intensive writing training program from our group, indicated inconsistent and variable results on retention of learning gains, which strongly depended on the clinical profile of the patients involved. This raises the question whether it is possible to predict different training responses and better understand how this is determined by clinical characteristics, such as disease severity and the degree of cognitive impairment. Also, baseline task performance and early acquisition may determine long-term learning outcomes. Our main focus (primary dependent outcome) is to know which patients will be able to retain the learning gains after 4 weeks without training. For this aim, the investigators will use a home-based training program of a touchscreen task called the Swipe-Slide Pattern (SSP) task. Training of this SSP-task will be offered on a tablet under single and dual task conditions in a random fashion, not only to provide variation but also to increase the cognitive challenge, thereby stimulating consolidation. A crucial factor, which may affect the success of training, is compliance, which the investigators will measure objectively for the first time. As independent variables the investigators will measure several motor and cognitive functions as well as compliance, while including a broad sample of PD patients.", "detailed_description": "In order to achieve personalised rehabilitation in PD, it is imperative to understand which factors predict whether a patient will benefit from targeted training. To date, only few studies have looked into the predictors of gait and balance training and identified cognitive function at baseline and initial motor performance as the most important determinants. However, these studies focused on global cognitive function, while cognitive subdomains, such as executive function and memory, which are most affected in PD, likely impact more seriously on learning. In addition, patients with cognitive impairments were excluded in these studies. Hence, little is known about how non-motor symptoms, which may also include apathy and depression, interact with the capacity to retain learning in PD.\n\nSo far, the determinants of motor learning retention have only been examined as secondary analyses of effect studies in PD. Hence, this study aims to identify predictive factors, including motor and non-motor symptoms, for sustained motor learning in a wide and large PD cohort. The primary dependent outcome is to identify which patients are able to retain the learning gains after 4 weeks without training.\n\nGiven the impaired touchscreen skills and the espoused difficulties with retention, training of touchscreen sliding motions will be delivered on a tablet enabling practice in the home setting. Both single (ST) and dual task (DT) conditions will be offered in a random order and feedback will be provided to enhance motivation and retention. This project aims to identify the predictive factors for effect maintenance after receiving this two-week training program. The investigators will recruit a broad cohort of PD patients. Sample size was estimated, using a squared multiple correlation coefficient of 0.17 based on a prediction model from earlier work, which included DT-motor performance and cognitive function as determinants. Using an α = 0.05 and β = 0.20, sample size was calculated for a linear multiple regression: fixed model, R² deviation from 0. Although the number of predictors is dependent on possible multicollinearity, sample size was computed on the assumption of 10 predictors. Sample size was estimated to be 89 and after accounting for a dropout of 20%, 107 patients will have to be included. Importantly, this sample size is also supported by the rule of thumb to include 10 participants per predictor, suggested by Harrell et al. (1996). As the investigators expect to include 10 predictors in our multiple linear regression model (see below), a total number of 100 PD patients will be recruited. The investigators will enroll a wide range of cognitive profiles. However, all patients need to be able to follow instructions and engage in the motor learning. During the instructions of how to perform the touchscreen task, the investigators will assess eligibility pragmatically. The investigators will exclude PD-dementia using level I MDS-diagnostic criteria. All patients will train the SSP-task for a duration of two weeks. On day 1 (T0), all participants will undergo an extensive screening session, including motor and non-motor tests performed at the subject's home or in a quiet room in our laboratory at KU Leuven, according to patients' preference.\n\nThe global cognitive screening will consist of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment. Moreover, 2 specific tests will assess each cognitive subdomain. Attention and working memory are captured by the digit and visual span forward and backward test. The trail making and alternating names tests will be used for executive function. Visuospatial function will be examined using the short form of the Benton's judgement of line orientation and the Rey Osterrieth Complex figure. The 30-min recall of the latter test will also be used to assess memory, together with the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning test. The Boston naming test and the Animal fluency test of the Controlled Oral Word Association test will be used to assess language. Other non-motor features, such as anxiety, depression, and sleep quality, will be tested using validated questionnaires for PD. Touchscreen skills will be assessed using the SSP-test in ST and DT condition, the mobile phone task (MPT, typing a predefined telephone number on a smartphone) and specific questionnaires. Following the baseline session, all patients will receive 10 training sessions of the SSP-task randomly in ST and DT condition (2 weeks, 5 days/week, 10 min/session) over a period of two weeks. The training is home-based and unsupervised. Both immediately after training (T1) and after a four-week retention period (T2), touchscreen skills will be assessed at home. To account for performance bias due to other training, other rehabilitation content will be recorded.\n\nFor model selection, the investigators will follow the recommendation of the PROBAST tool and reduce the number of cognitive tests accordingly. Other independent variables may include age, gender, disease duration, the New Freezing of Gait Questionnaire, and LEDD. The investigators will also calculate a measure of early acquisition. After exploratory univariate analysis, the investigators expect to include 10 independent variables, taking multicollinearity into account.\n\nAdditionally, the investigators will study the determinants of compliance and its association with retention, as compliance with unsupervised home-based training is likely to be associated with specific non-motor characteristics. Apathy and the anticipation of reward have been shown to determine the level of effort generated for exercise in PD unlike in HC. Also, one previous study investigated the relationship between the success of a balance training program and compliance in PD, establishing compliance to be one of the two most important determinants. Other work revealed that disease duration was found to be related to the degree of motor learning of the SSP-task and to exercise adherence altogether. Hence, compliance is likely associated with training outcomes in PD (long- and short-term) and may be modulated by (multiple) clinical characteristics. Compliance will be automatically logged by the digitized system and stored in a secured data cloud. Training compliance will be expressed as a percentage of the desired number of sessions and personalized time, with a maximum of 100%. The investigators will analyze the relation between compliance and clinical characteristics first with a multiple linear regression model.

Amongst these problems, using a touchscreen is becoming increasingly burdensome. In addition, a variety of non-motor symptoms, including cognitive impairment have a significant impact on the quality of life of patients with PD which will also affect the use of mobile devices. As the degradation of dopaminergic neurons in the striatum results in an impaired capacity for motor learning and more specifically for consolidation in motor memory, the investigators want to unravel the remaining rehabilitation potential in this patient group. Recent work on the consolidation of an intensive writing training program from our group, indicated inconsistent and variable results on retention of learning gains, which strongly depended on the clinical profile of the patients involved. This raises the question whether it is possible to predict different training responses and better understand how this is determined by clinical characteristics, such as disease severity and the degree of cognitive impairment. Also, baseline task performance and early acquisition may determine long-term learning outcomes. Our main focus (primary dependent outcome) is to know which patients will be able to retain the learning gains after 4 weeks without training. For this aim, the investigators will use a home-based training program of a touchscreen task called the Swipe-Slide Pattern (SSP) task. Training of this SSP-task will be offered on a tablet under single and dual task conditions in a random fashion, not only to provide variation but also to increase the cognitive challenge, thereby stimulating consolidation. A crucial factor, which may affect the success of training, is compliance, which the investigators will measure objectively for the first time. As independent variables the investigators will measure several motor and cognitive functions as well as compliance, while including a broad sample of PD patients.\n\n\nDetailed Description:\nIn order to achieve personalised rehabilitation in PD, it is imperative to understand which factors predict whether a patient will benefit from targeted training. To date, only few studies have looked into the predictors of gait and balance training and identified cognitive function at baseline and initial motor performance as the most important determinants. However, these studies focused on global cognitive function, while cognitive subdomains, such as executive function and memory, which are most affected in PD, likely impact more seriously on learning. In addition, patients with cognitive impairments were excluded in these studies.", "scraped_at": "2026-01-19T00:14:35.366172+00:00", "source": "ClinicalTrials"}

This type of assessment evaluates physical function, nutrition, social support, psychological well-being, medical conditions (both cancer-related and non-cancer-related), and cognitive function.

One of the most used synthetic scaffolds is hydrogel. Hydrogels owning three-dimensional cross-linked network structures have physical and chemical properties like human tissues . They can not only simulate the extracellular matrix (ECM) of bone but also allow the storage, and transport of various growth factors, cytokines, and nutrients due to their high permeability .", "detailed_description": "Research question:\n\nIs xenograft with hydrogel more effective than xenograft in the socket preservation After tooth extraction? Statement of the problem Alveolar socket preservation therapies aim to maintaining the hard and soft tissue dimensions of the alveolar ridge that are partially lost after tooth extraction as part of the natural physiological healing process. The reduction of alveolar bone volume following tooth extraction may interfere with placement of implants and affect the treatment and success of fixed or removable prosthesis with regard to function and esthetics. Alveolar socket preservation via socket filling with a bone graft can be an effective therapy to prevent physiologic bone loss after extraction of teeth in both the horizontal and the vertical dimension - Rationale for conducting a study The ideal scaffolds used for alveolar ridge preservation are supposed to show good biocompatibility, mechanical properties, and formability for irregularly shaped bone defects, as well as degradation rates matching bone growth . One of the most used synthetic scaffolds is hydrogel. Hydrogels owning three-dimensional cross-linked network structures have physical and chemical properties like human tissues . They can not only simulate the extracellular matrix (ECM) of bone but also allow the storage, and transport of various growth factors, cytokines, and nutrients due to their high permeability .\n\nExplanation for choice of comparators:\n\nThe comparator here is the well-known technique of extraction socket preservation with xenograft ,as preservation of extraction sockets has become a more popular treatment over the last 15 years, Xenografts are the most commonly used in regenerative therapy for alveolar ridge preservation as they contain similar hydroxyapatite content to that of natural bone which allows the graft to revascularize and be replaced by new bone, also the intervention and comparator have a common feature of being enhance bone formation by promoting osteoconduction, osteoinduction, and osteogenesis.\n\nIII. Methods A) Participants, interventions \\& outcomes 9.

Sample size: A total of (22) cases. i.e. (11) cases per group In a previous study by Shokry et al in 2023 the alveolar bone height using xenograft after 3 months showed a standard deviation of 0.4. If the true difference in the experimental and control means is 0.5 we will need to study 11 patients per group to be able to reject the null hypothesis that the population means of the experimental and control groups are equal with probability (power) 0.8. The Type I error probability associated with this test of this null hypothesis is 0.05. Sample size was increased by 15% to compensate for possible dropouts to reach 13 patients per group. Sample size was calculated using PS Power and Sample for windows version 3.1.6 using independent t test.\n\n   15\\. Recruitment: Patients will be selected by the supervisors and the researchers from outpatient clinic of OMFS departments at Faculty of Dentistry - Cairo University will start in December 2024.

Statement of the problem Alveolar socket preservation therapies aim to maintaining the hard and soft tissue dimensions of the alveolar ridge that are partially lost after tooth extraction as part of the natural physiological healing process. The reduction of alveolar bone volume following tooth extraction may interfere with placement of implants and affect the treatment and success of fixed or removable prosthesis with regard to function and esthetics. Alveolar socket preservation via socket filling with a bone graft can be an effective therapy to prevent physiologic bone loss after extraction of teeth in both the horizontal and the vertical dimension - Rationale for conducting a study The ideal scaffolds used for alveolar ridge preservation are supposed to show good biocompatibility, mechanical properties, and formability for irregularly shaped bone defects, as well as degradation rates matching bone growth .

Despite significant disease burden and increased sick leave among these individuals, we lack today any therapeutic and preventive measures.\n\nWe aim to (1). establish a nation-wide health program, (2). develop an algorithm for disease risk estimation and (3). test a novel strategy to delay and/or prevent disease onset in seropositive at risk individuals with musculoskeletal complains. We will perform a multicentre randomised study to treat autoantibody-positive individuals at risk for developing RA presenting with pain (Population), by repurposing of bisphosphonates (Intervention) as compared to placebo (Control) to treat pain (primary Outcome) and delay/prevent RA development during 1-year follow-up (secondary Outcome)\n\n\nDetailed Description:\nwe have recently identified a novel disease-triggering pathogenic mechanism in autoantibody-positive individuals consisting in a bone-mediated induction of pain by autoantibodies. We hypothesize that specific targeting of this new mechanism, rather than using therapies developed for already established disease (where other mechanisms are active), will be able to treat pain with arthralgia and halt disease progression in seropositive at-risk individuals.\n\nWe will address this hypothesis by repurposing of bisphosphonates, currently used in clinical practice in both RA patients as well as in many individuals at risk for RA (mainly women in post-menopausal age). We will perform a multi centre, prospective, randomised, double-blind and placebo-controlled study with 2 parallel groups.\n\nPatients will be randomised 1:1 to receive either one infusion aclasta (5 mg zolendronic acid, n=40) or placebo (n=40). The primary outcome is the VAS pain score and the study is powered to detect a 20% difference in the primary endpoint between the active and the control arm.

The overarching goal of the proposed multilevel, multicomponent intervention, Diet and Active Lifestyle - Yuuyaraq (DAiLY), is to reduce consumption of highly processed store-bought foods while promoting intake of subsistence foods, healthy store-bought foods, and a more active lifestyle to reduce heart disease risk. The Yup\\&amp;amp;#39;ik word Yuuyaraq means 'the Yup'ik way of life' and encompasses a worldview in which living in harmony with the environment, as well as sharing of subsistence foods and traditional knowledge is central.

Aim 3, will determine the impact of the DAiLY intervention on community-level outcomes, including access to, and sales of, healthy foods in local stores, as well as opportunities for physical activity at community venues.", "detailed_description": "Background Heart disease (HD) is the leading cause of death for Alaska Native men and the second leading cause of death among women. HD mortality among the Yup\\&amp;#39;ik Alaska Native people is 30% higher than that for all races in the U.S. The traditional Yup\\&amp;#39;ik diet is associated with a reduction in multiple risk factors for HD, but over the past 60 years, this dietary pattern has been replaced by a shift toward ultra-processed foods high in saturated fat, salt and sugar which have been linked to increased risk for HD. At the same time, there has been a shift to a more sedentary lifestyle. The goal of this project is to determine the effectiveness of a culturally adapted intervention to reduce HD risk among Yup\\&amp;amp;#39;ik Alaska Native people by encouraging increased consumption of heart healthy traditional and market foods, as well as increased physical activity.\n\nIntervention Approach This work adheres to a Community-Based Participatory Research (CBPR) framework, which depends heavily upon community engagement and partnership throughout the entire research process, and Indigenous Food Sovereignty (IFS), a concept that represents Indigenous peoples\\&#39; ability to control their food systems, including the production, distribution, and consumption of food. The Yup\\&amp;amp;#39;ik word Yuuyaraq means \\&amp;amp;#39;the Yup\\&amp;amp;#39;ik way of life\\&amp;amp;#39; and it encompasses the Yup\\&amp;amp;#39;ik worldview which is founded on traditional values of respect for humans, animals, and the environment in which they live, sharing of resources (including subsistence foods), sharing stories and knowledge, and an interpersonal relationship with nature as a source of wellness. The proposed intervention, Diet and Active Lifestyle- Yuuyaraq (DAiLY), is based on Yup\\&amp;amp;#39;ik worldview principles.\n\nDAiLY Intervention Components The intervention will be delivered through three complementary components, each supported and reinforced by community media, including social media (Facebook), texting and visual materials.\n\n1. Home-Based Workshops (HBWs) will be delivered by trained members of the local community. The aim of the HBWs is to increase knowledge, skills and confidence related to to food (e.g., understanding nutrition labels, the benefits of traditional foods, supporting traditional subsistence and harvesting practices, making healthy market food choices, and healthy food preparation and serving methods), as well as participants\\&amp;amp;#39; awareness of the importance of physical activity and maintaining a healthy weight. An emphasis is placed on understanding the benefits of consuming traditional subsistence foods, as well as heart-healthy foods from the local stores to complement the traditional diet.\n2. Food store modifications will increase access to heart-healthy foods in local stores by working with store managers to stock and promote affordable healthy food options, which will in turn provide participants with the opportunity to implement what they have learned in the HBWs. Point of purchase promotions in stores, including educational displays, taste tests and cooking demonstrations, and temporary price reductions to build demand, will identify and promote these foods to community members.\n3. Physical Activity (PA) opportunities will be increased, and will include community-based activities that have been identified by community members. These will emphasize traditional activities, such as Yuraq traditional Yup\\&amp;amp;#39;ik Dance, Native sports events, and berry festivals. Fitbits will be given to participants and used as a motivational tool to encourage and allow participants to track their PA progress during and after the intervention.\n\nImplementation and Assessment Community research associates (CRAs) will implement the DAiLY intervention after being trained by the study team, with follow-up booster trainings as needed. The intervention will be carried out in four communities, two of which will participate first (immediate intervention), allowing for comparison of outcomes among those who have and have not yet received the intervention. Once the follow-up data collection is complete, the second two communities (delayed intervention) will receive the intervention. Throughout all phases of the intervention, data will be collected about how well and to what extent the DAiLY intervention was implemented by the study team in each community.\n\nThe impact of the DAiLY intervention will be measured through changes in individual participants heart disease risk factors, as well as in the community food stores and in terms of access to increased PA opportunities at the community level. Participants will be asked to donate a fasting blood sample to measure the different factors that affect risk for heart disease, and study investigators (Boyer and Hopkins) will measure participants\\&amp;amp;#39; weight, blood pressure and waist circumference. ActiGraph GT3X+, high-resolution triaxial accelerometers will be used to measure physical activity levels, in addition to completing a Yup\\&amp;amp;#39;ik Wellness Questionnaire to assess participation in traditional and community activities and confidence to adopt healthy behaviors. In addition, a Yup\\&amp;amp;#39;ik Food Frequency Questionnaire will be used to assess how participants report changes in dietary patterns and knowledge of healthy dietary behaviors. In community food stores, data will be collected on stocking and sales of promoted foods in store, as well as food store owners\\&amp;amp;#39; and managers\\&amp;amp;#39; expectations of sales of healthy food before and after the DAiLY intervention. We will also monitor changes in the availability, use (# people), PA quality and duration of community traditional PA opportunities. Physical activity opportunities in the community will be coordinated with the HBW modules and will include communityevents and subsistence activites. CRAs will receive $2000 per community to sponsor community-wide events. These activities will be initiated and promoted as part of the DAiLY including community campaigns to \\&amp;amp;#34;park it and walk\\&amp;amp;#34; to limit use of of snow machines and ATVs in the community, Fitbit step challenges, initiation of women\\&amp;amp;#39;s \\&amp;amp;#34;walking groups\\&amp;amp;#34; to gather their children at evening curfew, promotion of cultural events such as Yuraq traditional Yup\\&amp;amp;#39;ik dance, holding berry festivals (including picking competitions) and supporting additional sports events (basketball, volleyball and Native games) in the school gyms. All of these community-level activities were suggested by our CPG.\n\nOverall Project Aims Aim 1: Determine the effectiveness of the DAiLY intervention on HD risk by measuring: (1) change in a continuous metabolic syndrome (cMS) risk score (primary outcome) in Yup\\&amp;amp;#39;ik adults; and (2) secondary outcomes including PA (using accelerometry), dietary change using objectively measured biomarkers, as well as dietary consumption, and change in psychosocial measures (i.e., knowledge, self-efficacy and intentions).\n\nAim 2: Assess implementation of the DAiLY intervention using a mixed methods process evaluation using a sequential explanatory design to determine: (1) reach, dose delivered, and fidelity; (2) barriers and facilitators to implementing program activities; and (3) participant satisfaction and engagement. Aim 3: Determine the impact of the DAiLY intervention on community-level outcomes including: (1) access to, and sales of, healthy foods in local stores; (2) access to community venues (e.g., school gyms and community halls for PA); and (3) frequency and level of engagement in subsistence activities and community-wide events.\n\nSharing Results and Dissemination of Program Materials A major objective of DAiLY is to share the results with the participating communities, as well as others who develop health promotion programs. The study team will continuously share the progress and results of the intervention with local community Tribal governments and healthcare leaders in order to ensure the communities that participated can determine next steps in their best interest. After completion of the trial, all intervention materials will be made available and freely downloadable from the study website.", "eligibility_criteria": "Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Participants Inclusion criteria: Self-identify as Yup\\&#39;ik Alaska Native, Lives in a participating Yup\\&#39;ik community, Does not plan to move out of the community throughout the intervention (24 months), 18 years of age or older.\n* Communities Inclusion criteria: Willing to participate in the DAiLY intervention as evidenced by letters of support for the intervention study provided by community Tribal governments; Willing and ready to participate in the Community Based Participatory Research process (Community Planning Group, Home-based Workshops, Food Store Component, review of research outcomes) Food stores Inclusion Criteria: Located within the participating community, Store commonly used by community members, Does not anticipate closing permanently during the intervention period, Tribal Corporation stores (governed by Tribal Council) willing and able to facilitate all of the following intervention components at their food store: allow interactive sessions / taste tests in their food store, increase stocking of healthy foods and beverages, allow display of intervention shelf labels and other educational materials in their store (e.g., posters, flyers)\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Participants Exclusion criteria: Currently pregnant (as dietary intake and PA recommendations differ during pregnancy), Anticipates moving out of the community in the next 24 months, Age is under 18 years of age, Participated in the pilot intervention", "minimum_age": "18 Years", "maximum_age": "", "sex": "ALL", "healthy_volunteers": true, "type": "protocol", "filename": "clinical_trial_NCT06629610.html", "text": "NCT ID: NCT06629610\n\nTitle: A Community-led Intervention (DAiLY) Promoting a Heart-healthy Diet and Active Lifestyle: The Yup&#39;ik Way\n\nStatus: RECRUITING\n\n\nBrief Summary:\nHeart disease is the leading cause of death for Alaska Native men and the second leading cause of death (after cancer) among women and Alaska Native people overall.

A continuous metabolic syndrome score will be used as the primary outcome to assess changes in heart disease risk, and objective stable isotope biomarkers of diet and a validated food frequency questionnaire will be used to measure intake of traditional and market foods. We will test the DAiLY intervention in four Yupik communities, randomized to immediate and delayed intervention. Aim 1, will determine the effectiveness of the DAiLY intervention on heart disease risk by measuring change in a continuous metabolic syndrome risk score (primary outcome).", "scraped_at": "2026-01-19T00:14:35.663758+00:00", "source": "ClinicalTrials"}

Furthermore, The investigators posit that the determination of RAD51-foci score in tumour identifies patients who can benefit from olaparib beyond mutations in these 5 genes. This hypothesis will be tested in cohort 2.\n\n\nDetailed Description:\nThis is an open-label, single arm, multicentre phase II study evaluating treatment with olaparib in patients with unresectable locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer (MBC) in two cohorts:\n\n1. with mutation in germline/somatic BRCA1/2, PALB2 or RAD51C/D and\n2.

Patients with BRCA1, BRCA2, PALB2, RAD51C or RAD51D mutations that are considered to be non-detrimental (eg, \"Variants of uncertain clinical significance\" or \"Variant of unknown significance\" or \"Variant, favor polymorphism\" or \"benign polymorphism,\" etc) will not be eligible for this cohort.\n  * Cohort 2: HER2-negative ABC with RAD51-foci low score in the most recent locally recurrence or metastatic biopsy and without known or with negative germline or somatic mutation in BRCA1, BRCA2, PALB2, RAD51C or RAD51D predicted to be deleterious or suspected deleterious (known or predicted to be detrimental/lead to loss of function). Mutation status will be assessed in, at least, olaparib responding patients in this subgroup.\n* Phenotypic tumour selection: Patients can have either triple-negative breast cancer (defined as ER and PgR negative (IHC nuclear staining \\<1%) and HER2 negative (IHC 0, 1+ or 2+ and/or ISH non-amplified with ratio less than 2.0) or ER/PgR positive breast cancer, as long as they are HER2 negative.", "scraped_at": "2026-01-19T00:14:35.665576+00:00", "source": "ClinicalTrials"}

A higher prevalence of stone disease is found in hot or dry areas, including 20% to 25% in the Middle East. Radiolucent stones are mostly uric acid (UA) calculi, which varies geographically with worldwide incidence ranges from 5 to 40% and about 7- 10 percent of all calculi. Other rare radiolucent stones include xanthine and 2,8-dihydroxyadenine calculi.\n\nThe main etiologic factors for the development of uric acid nephrolithiasis are low urinary pH, hyperuricosuria, and low urinary volume. Practically, all of those who form uric acid stones have persistently low urinary pH, and most excrete normal amounts of uric acid. This suggests the potential importance of urinary pH manipulation in dissolving UA stones. Dissolution therapy for UA calculi is based on hydration and raising the urinary pH. European guidelines recommended that urine pH should be increased to a level above 6. The early published papers discussed the efficacy of oral chemo-dissolution therapy reporting high success rates. Since that era, there have been only a few publications, with widely variable results (15-80% complete dissolution rate).\n\nRetrograde intrarenal surgery (RIRS), shockwave lithotripsy (SWL), and percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL) are the three main non-medical modalities for treating medium-sized renal stones. Resorlu et al., retrospectively compare the outcomes of SWL, PNL, and RSIS for 10-20 mm radiolucent renal calculi of 437 patients and concluded that success rates \"defined as stone-free status or asymptomatic insignificant residual fragments \\<3 mm.\" were 66.5, 91.4, and 87 % for SWL, PNL, and RIRS (p\\<0.001). in a prospective randomized of 135 patient with 1 to 2 cm radiolucent lower calyceal renal calculi, the 3-month stone-free rate of SWL, RIRS and miniperc was 73.8%, 86.1% and 95.1%, respectively (p =0.01).\n\nComparing the medical in the form of dissolution therapy versus non-medical in the form of SWL, Elderwy et al, in a prospective study on 87 children with radiolucent renal calculi with length less than 25 mm and a normal upper urinary tract or grade I HN, found that stone-free rate was 72.9% for dissolution therapy vs 82.1% after a single session of shock wave lithotripsy (p = 0.314).\n\nDissolution success is related to stone size as well as compliance. Larger stones demand longer therapy, and in these cases SWL may increase treatment efficacy by increasing stone surface area.

Resorlu et al., retrospectively compare the outcomes of SWL, PNL, and RSIS for 10-20 mm radiolucent renal calculi of 437 patients and concluded that success rates \"defined as stone-free status or asymptomatic insignificant residual fragments \\<3 mm.\" were 66.5, 91.4, and 87 % for SWL, PNL, and RIRS (p\\<0.001). in a prospective randomized of 135 patient with 1 to 2 cm radiolucent lower calyceal renal calculi, the 3-month stone-free rate of SWL, RIRS and miniperc was 73.8%, 86.1% and 95.1%, respectively (p =0.01).\n\nComparing the medical in the form of dissolution therapy versus non-medical in the form of SWL, Elderwy et al, in a prospective study on 87 children with radiolucent renal calculi with length less than 25 mm and a normal upper urinary tract or grade I HN, found that stone-free rate was 72.9% for dissolution therapy vs 82.1% after a single session of shock wave lithotripsy (p = 0.314).\n\nDissolution success is related to stone size as well as compliance. Larger stones demand longer therapy, and in these cases SWL may increase treatment efficacy by increasing stone surface area.

The ethical approval number is: NU-REC/11-018/12. All participants consented to participate in the first section of the Google form and written informed consent was obtained from all students who participated in the focus group discussion\n\nStudy design and Population:\n\nThis prospective cross-sectional study was conducted among first-year medical students at the University of Khartoum enrolled in the thorax module of their Gross Anatomy course. The total population comprised 360 students. Participation in the Telegram channel created for anatomy learning was voluntary, and the students were given the option to subscribe. No sampling was conducted, to ensure that all students had equal access to the benefits of the channel and the investigators did not wish to exclude anyone ethically.\n\nContext and Setting:\n\nThe curriculum of Gross Anatomy of Bachelor of Medicine and Surgery at the University of Khartoum is taught over 3 semesters; Thorax and Abdomen in the first semester, Pelvis and Limbs in the second semester, and Head and Neck in the third semester. This study was conducted on first-year medical students enrolled in the thorax module of the undergraduate program, with a total of 360 students. The thorax module is taught for four weeks through dissection room (DR) practical sessions, lectures, and case-based discussions. In the practical sessions, students are divided into small groups each group contains 10 to 12 students and is guided by the practical module through four stations containing prosected cadavers, prosected specimens, plastic models, and dry and plastic bones. Each station is moderated by a departmental tutor. The assessment of the thorax module is performed through a mid-semester exam (which only covers the thorax module) and a final semester exam (which covers both thorax and abdomen modules). Both exams consisted of a spotter test and a written paper test (containing single best-answer questions and short-answer questions).\n\nTelegram Channel:\n\nTelegram allows users to create channels to broadcast messages to large audience members. These channels can have an unlimited number of subscribers who will only receive messages posted by the channel's administration. These messages reach the subscribers directly and appear as notifications on their phones with each post. The channel supports a wide range of content types, from written posts, photos, and auto-playing videos to quizzes and beyond. It also provides the administrators with detailed statistics on the channel's growth and the viewing numbers of its posts. Telegram also allows users to create bots. These are special accounts that can be used to send and receive anonymous messages.\n\nA Telegram channel was created on the 16th of October 2020 under the name \"Doses of Human Anatomy\". Students were invited to join the channel through an invitation link sent to their cohort's Telegram group. The channel began posting on the 17th of October 2020. It was posting five days a week on a regular basis, from Saturday to Wednesday, over a period of four weeks. These posts were ongoing, in line with the practical sessions of the thorax. On October 29th, a Telegram feedback bot account was created and shared with the channel, allowing students to give feedback about the channel and suggesting specific topics to be targeted by the new posts.\n\nThroughout the one-month study period, quizzes (formative tests different from the summative test, which was done after the end of the thorax module) were created and shared on the channel at the end of every week. These were programmed mini-tests, usually consisting of five questions each. The performance of students ordered by their scores and the time they took to answer the quiz became available to the channel administrators as soon as the answers were submitted. Students also received immediate programmed feedback for any question that they submitted an incorrect answer.\n\nDuring the study period, the channel posted 17 posts. There were nine written posts with image illustrations, two written posts without image illustrations, five quizzes, and one video.\n\nAssessment, Questionnaire and Focus Group Discussion:\n\nAfter finishing the thorax module (one month of using the Telegram channel), a Google form containing a 20-multiple-choice-questions (MCQs) assessment test (summative test) and a feedback questionnaire were shared with all students (360 students) on their telegram accounts, telegram groups, and on the telegram channel itself. The questions on the assessment test were set by two independent assessors from the Department of Anatomy at the University of Khartoum. Both assessors were not subscribers to the channel and had no knowledge of the material posted on the channel. The 20 questions covered the entire thoracic module. The feedback questionnaire targeted demographic data, sources of studying anatomy, favorite types of posts, the role of the channel in learning anatomy, and whether students recommend the channel to continue posting or to stop. Sectioning the Google form allowed all first-year medical students in the thorax module to participate in the assessment test, while only subscribers to submit a response the feedback questionnaire.\n\nFocused group discussion:\n\nAfter the one-week window of receiving responses on the Google form, the form was closed, and the investigators issued a call for students subscribed to the channel to voluntarily participate in a focus group discussion. This call was open for one week, and eight students responded, receiving invitations to participate in the discussion. This FGD was in person and took approximately one and a half hours. Qualitative feedback was collected through six open-ended questions. These questions targeted students' studying approaches, their reflections on the material provided by the channel, the impact of the channel, and their suggestions to improve the channel. The discussion was voice-recorded, and the responses were categorized for further grouping and analysis.\n\nData Entry and Analysis:\n\nThe data was entered automatically from the Google form into an Excel sheet. Data was then analyzed using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) ver22. Descriptive statistics in the form of frequencies, percentages, tables, and figures are presented. Independent sample t-test and Chi-square test were used to assess associations. A p-value was considered significant when less than 0.05 at a confidence level of 95%.\n\nThe focus group discussion was recorded, and a Microsoft Word copy of the transcript was created after cleaning and labelling.", "eligibility_criteria": "Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* First Year medical students at the University of Khartoum, Sudan and enrolled in the thorax module of their Gross Anatomy course\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* No", "minimum_age": "", "maximum_age": "", "sex": "ALL", "healthy_volunteers": false, "type": "protocol", "filename": "clinical_trial_NCT06673420.html", "text": "NCT ID: NCT06673420\n\nTitle: Enhancing Anatomy Education for First-Year Medical Students Through a Telegram® Channel: a Cross-sectional Study on Learning Augmentation.\n\nStatus: COMPLETED\n\n\nBrief Summary:\nThe goal of this observational study is to evaluate the effects of Telegram channel on anatomy education for fist year medical students and measure students' reflections on it.

The study seeks to enroll adults with secondary progressive MS (SPMS), aged 50-85, who are not currently taking a MS disease-modifying therapy and have noticed their MS symptoms getting worse. People who join the study will take the medicines dasatinib and quercetin by mouth every two weeks for three months. These medicines work together to remove old, damaged cells that may cause inflammation and slow the repair of nerves. Participants will also be followed for one year from enrollment to monitor for treatment effects.", "detailed_description": "Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic immune-mediated inflammatory and neurodegenerative disorder of the central nervous system (CNS), which afflicts approximately one million people in the United States. Age is the strongest driver of disease course in MS. With increasing age, most older adults with MS develop a progressive disease phenotype characterized by gradual accrual of irreversible neurological disability, for which there are no effective treatments that reliably slow disease progression. Cellular senescence is a hallmark of aging, whereby senescent cells accumulate with age and produce mediators of inflammation through the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP). In MS, senescent cells have been identified in both the central nervous system and peripheral immune compartments contributing to SASP expression, promoting chronic inflammation, axonal damage, and failure of myelin repair, and ultimately leading to functional decline. Senescent cells can be selectively removed by senolytic drugs, which delay age-related dysfunction in animal models and show potential for improving functional outcomes in human clinical trials. The senolytic drug combination of dasatinib and quercetin (D+Q) selectively induces apoptosis of senescent cells in human tissue. Our pilot data shows D+Q treatment improves function and survival in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, the widely used animal model of MS. Emerging evidence from early phase clinical trials of D+Q in age-related diseases shows improvement of gait speed in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and CNS penetrance of dasatinib in Alzheimer's disease. However, studies of senolytic therapy for people with MS have yet to be conducted. The investigators hypothesize that treatment with D+Q will be well tolerated, improve physical and cognitive function, reduce circulating biomarkers of senescence and neurodegeneration, and attenuate T-cell immune exhaustion. The investigators will test this hypothesis through a single arm, open label, study to 1) determine the feasibility of 3 months of intermittent D+Q treatment in 30 older adults age 50-85 with secondary progressive MS and 2) to obtain preliminary data of D+Q treatment on physical and cognitive function and 3) serum biomarkers of senescence, neurodegeneration, and the circulatory T cell repertoire.

It is defined as the loss of the normal glandular architecture of the stomach. It forms part of the so-called \"Correa cascade\", first described in 1988. This cascade posits that intestinal-type GC develops along a defined pathway of pre-neoplastic lesions. The initiation of this pathway is triggered by chronic inflammation affecting the gastric mucosa. The cause of this chronic inflammation is most commonly Helicobacter Pylori, although chronic autoimmune gastritis accounts for a minority of cases. The chronic inflammation over time causes the loss of the normal glandular architecture characteristic of gastric atrophy. With the ongoing presence of the initiating factor and persistence of the chronic inflammatory phenotype, the GA can progress to intestinal-type metaplasia and then to dysplasia and, ultimately, intestinal-type gastric cancer.\n\nThe precise risk of progression to GC in those with GA is poorly understood, particularly in lower-risk Western countries such as Ireland. In higher-risk countries such as Japan and South Korea, the reported risk may be as high as 0.1 to 0.3% per year. This is similar to the rates of malignant progression seen in low-risk colorectal adenomas and the risk seen in non-dysplastic Barrett's. This has prompted increased interest in the concept of surveilling patients with GA in the hopes of earlier identification of GC. Indeed, there is evidence to suggest that if Helicobacter Pylori is eradicated in patients with GA, the Correa cascade can be halted, and the risk of developing GC can be greatly reduced.\n\nThe British Society of Gastroenterology addressed this issue in their guideline document published in 2019. The guideline addresses several issues concerning managing patients at risk of developing Gastric Adenocarcinoma. Central to this is the concept of managing patients with GA. The guideline advocates for increased endoscopist awareness of the macroscopic features of the atrophic stomach. When recognised, the endoscopist should then take targeted biopsies as per the Updated Sydney System. This biopsy regimen involves taking Biopsies from the antrum, both lesser and greater curvature, the incisura and the gastric body again, both lesser and greater curvature. These biopsies should be sent to the lab in separately labelled specimen jars. The histological assessment should then be conducted using the Operative link for Gastritis assessment system, also known as the OLGA system. This classifies the severity of GA into 4 subtypes. There is evidence to suggest that patients with OLGA stage 3 or 4 GA should enter a 3-yearly surveillance program. This pathway is well established and in practice.\n\nThe issue currently, however, remains identifying patients with GA. With ever-increasing waiting lists for endoscopic procedures and growing numbers of dyspeptic patients, there is a need to triage referrals to increase the diagnostic yield from oesophagogastroduodenoscopies (OGDs). The use of Biomarkers to identify patients at risk of GA is one such potential pathway.\n\nA panel of biomarkers (commercially available as the GastroPanel), including pepsinogen 1, pepsinogen 2, Gastrin 17, and IgG antibodies to Helicobacter pylori, has been shown to predict GA in high-risk regions. However, their efficacy in identifying GA in lower-risk Western cohorts of patients is less well known. This combination of biomarkers is instructive of the morphological state of the gastric mucosa. Pepsinogen 1 is produced predominantly by the chief cells of the oxyntic mucosa of the corpus and fundus of the stomach. Pepsinogen 2 is similarly produced by the chief cells but also by neck mucous cells, which are found in the oxyntic mucosa and the pyloric mucosa of the antrum and pyloric canal. Thus, in the setting of GA of the oxyntic mucosa, pepsinogen 1 levels will decrease to a greater extent than pepsinogen 2 levels. Gastrin 17 is a peptide produced by the G cells of the diffuse neuroendocrine system located in the pyloric mucosa of the antrum and pyloric canal. Decreased levels of Gastrin 17 are seen in the setting of GA of the pylorus. Thus, by evaluating the levels of these biomarkers, it may be possible to predict both the presence and topological extent of GA.\n\nAn assessment of these biomarker levels, in concert with the patient's clinical history, including symptoms and risk factors, could then be used to triage OGD waiting lists. Patients with biomarker levels suggestive of GA may then be prioritised for an OGD.\n\nPrevious testing algorithms for these biomarkers involved the drawing of a serum sample and then assessment of the biomarker levels via an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) test. This may have limited application in the clinical setting, given the lab space and experience needed to conduct this test. However, recent improvements in point-of-care testing technology, including the development of an immunological lateral flow testing method for these biomarkers (GastroPanel QuickTest), raise the possibility of a useable clinic-based test. The most recent iteration of this device is based on the acquisition of a pinprick of whole blood from the patient's finger. This is similar in practice to the testing method of blood sugar levels, which is routinely done prior to various tests, including OGDs.\n\nWe intend to assess the diagnostic accuracy of this test against the gold standard of endoscopically obtained gastric mucosa biopsies in patients presenting for OGDs in Beaumont Hospital, Dublin, Ireland. Patients will be prospectively identified and invited to participate in the study following informed consent. When they arrive for their OGD, a pinprick of whole blood will be obtained prior to their OGD. The immunological lateral flow testing machine is portable and will be in the Endoscopy room. The test will be run while the patient has their OGD as planned. Routine biopsies from the oxyntic and pyloric mucosa will be obtained. The lateral flow test results will then be compared to the histological results of the biopsies to assess the diagnostic accuracy of both the biomarkers and the lateral flow testing method.", "eligibility_criteria": "Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Patients presenting for a routine diagnostic gastroscopy.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Patients presenting for a therapeutic procedure such as dilations or stenting.", "minimum_age": "18 Years", "maximum_age": "", "sex": "ALL", "healthy_volunteers": false, "type": "protocol", "filename": "clinical_trial_NCT07060482.html", "text": "NCT ID: NCT07060482\n\nTitle: Diagnostic Performance of Combined Assays for Gastrin-17, Pepsinogen and Anti-helicobacter Pylori Antibodies for Diagnosing Gastric Atrophy.\n\nStatus: NOT_YET_RECRUITING\n\n\nBrief Summary:\nThis research study is taking place to find out if a simple blood test can diagnose inflammation in the stomach.

This scoring system showed better prediction compared to standard models and was accepted to the Late- Breaking Science section at the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) Congress 2024.

Pre-procedural pain will be assessed during rest as well as on movement (15° passive elevation) of the affected limb and will be recorded on numeric pain rating scale (NRS) \\[0 = no pain; 10 = worst imaginable pain\\]. The blocks will be performed in supine position and strict sterile technique will be followed. Both the blocks will be performed as per the standard technique. The site to be blocked will be painted with 5% povidone-iodine followed by spirit and will be draped. A linear 7-13 mhz ultrasonography probe (sonoscape S 11plus, digital colour doppler ultrasound., Guangdong, China) will be used with in-plane approach of needle.

Depending on the allotted group, patients will be given the block under the guidance of ultrasound in the preoperative area by an experienced anesthesiologist with more than two years' experience. The S-FIB will be given as follows: With the patient in the proper position, the skin will be disinfected and the transducer positioned to identify the femoral artery and the iliopsoas muscle and fascia iliaca. The transducer will be moved laterally until the sartorius muscle is identified. The needle entry point will be anaesthetized with 2 ml 1% lidocaine and 23G spinal needle will be inserted. After negative aspiration, 1-2 ml of Inj Bupivacain 0.125% will be injected to confirm the proper injection plane between the fascia and the ilio-psoas muscle. A proper injection will result in the separation of the fascia iliaca by the local anesthetic in the medial-lateral direction from the point of injection as described. After the spread of the drug will be seen, the rest of the drug volume will be injected.\n\nThe I-FIB will be given in similar manner. In ultrasound guided I-FIB technique, a high frequency linear probe will be placed transversely at the level of the inguinal crease. After the femoral artery is identified, the probe will be moved laterally, and the hypoechoic iliopsoas muscle will be identified which is covered by the hyperechoic fascia iliaca. This fascia invests the femoral nerve medially and laterally covers the sartorius muscle. A needle will be inserted in-plane from lateral to medial and pierces the fascia iliaca at the junction of medial border of sartorius and iliopsoas muscle. Then Inj Bupivacain 0.125% will be deposited deep to fascia iliaca and will be seen spreading toward the femoral nerve medially.\n\nA numerical rating scale (NRS) pain score will be recorded after the block.

{"nct_id": "NCT01239082", "title": "CSP #577 - Colonoscopy vs. Fecal Immunochemical Testing in Reducing Mortality From Colorectal Cancer", "status": "ACTIVE_NOT_RECRUITING", "brief_summary": "Colorectal cancer (CRC) is currently the second most common cause of cancer death in the United States, and one of the most preventable cancers. It has been shown in several randomized controlled trials that screening using fecal occult blood testing (FOBT) reduces CRC mortality by 13-33%. While there is strong consensus amongst experts regarding the value of CRC screening, the best approach to screening is not clear. Of the widely recommended modalities, FOBT and colonoscopy are the most commonly used within the United States. FOBT is inexpensive, non-invasive, and its use as a screening tool is supported by the highest quality evidence (i.e. randomized controlled trials). Moreover, newer FOBT, such as fecal immunochemical tests or FITs, have advantages over conventional FOBT in terms of both test characteristics and ease of use that make them quite attractive as a population-based screening tool.\n\nWhile colonoscopy is invasive and has higher up-front risks and costs than FOBT, it does afford the opportunity to directly assess the colonic mucosa and is widely believed to be the best test to detect colorectal cancer. In addition, colonoscopy allows for the detection and removal of colorectal adenomas -a well recognized colorectal cancer precursor. There is indirect evidence that suggests colonoscopy is effective in reducing colorectal cancer mortality, but to date, no large clinical trials have been completed to support this assumption. While colonoscopy use is increasing, data is emerging that colonoscopy may not be as effective as previously believed. Prior support for colonoscopy as a screening test relied upon effectiveness estimates that now appear to be overly optimistic. Given the invasive nature of colonoscopy, the associated small, but real risk of complications, and dramatically higher costs than other screening tests, it is especially important to determine the true comparative effectiveness of colonoscopy relative to other proven non-invasive options.\n\nThe investigators propose to perform a, large, simple, multicenter, randomized, parallel group trial directly comparing screening colonoscopy with annual FIT screening in average risk individuals. The hypothesis is that colonoscopy will be superior to FIT in the prevention of colorectal cancer mortality measured over 10 years. Individuals will be enrolled if they are currently eligible for CRC screening (e.g. no colonoscopy in the past 10 years and no FOBT in the past 1 year) and are between 50 and 75 years of age. The investigators will exclude individuals for whom colonoscopy is indicated (e.g. signs or symptoms of CRC, first degree family member with CRC, personal history of colorectal neoplasia or inflammatory bowel disease).\n\nAll participants will complete baseline demographic, medication, and lifestyle questionnaires (e.g. diet, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory use, frequency of exercise) prior to randomization in a 1:1 ratio to either screening colonoscopy or annual FIT screening (Figure 1). Those testing positive by FIT will undergo evaluation to determine appropriateness for colonoscopy. Screening will be performed in a manner consistent with the currently accepted standard of care in order to determine the comparative effectiveness of the two screening strategies. Participants will be surveyed annually to determine if they have undergone colonoscopy or been diagnosed with CRC.\n\nThe primary study endpoint will be CRC mortality within 10 years of enrollment. The secondary endpoints are (1) the incidence of CRC within 10 years of enrollment and (2) major complications of colonoscopy. Mortality will be determined through queries of the VA Vital Status File. Cause of death will be determined primarily using death certificates from the National Death Index-Plus database, augmented by adjudication of medical records for known CRC cases where CRC is not listed as a cause of death on the death certificate. The investigators postulate that screening colonoscopy will result in a 40% reduction in CRC mortality over 10 years relative to annual FIT screening. Using a log-rank test with a 2-sided test of significance, =0.05, a sample size of 50,000 participants will be required to test the primary hypothesis with 82% power, assuming a 1% annual rate of crossover from FIT to colonoscopy and a 0.5% annual rate of loss to follow-up.
