A descriptive cross-sectional survey was conducted using a structured, anonymized self-administered questionnaire adapted from the Scientific Misconduct Questionnaire-Revised (SMQ-R). Data were analyzed using STATA version 16.0. Descriptive statistics summarized participant characteristics; bivariate and multivariable logistic regression were used to identify predictors of RM. The overall prevalence of self-reported RM, defined as engagement in any one of fabrication, falsification, or plagiarism (FFP), was 31.4% (22/70). Plagiarism and falsification were each reported by 20.0% of participants, while fabrication was reported by 1.4%. Most respondents were male (72.9%), held master's-level qualifications (70.0%), and had received prior ethics training (81.4%).

A descriptive cross-sectional survey was conducted using a structured, anonymized self-administered questionnaire adapted from the Scientific Misconduct Questionnaire-Revised (SMQ-R). Data were analyzed using STATA version 16.0. Descriptive statistics summarized participant characteristics; bivariate and multivariable logistic regression were used to identify predictors of RM. The overall prevalence of self-reported RM, defined as engagement in any one of fabrication, falsification, or plagiarism (FFP), was 31.4% (22/70). Plagiarism and falsification were each reported by 20.0% of participants, while fabrication was reported by 1.4%. Most respondents were male (72.9%), held master's-level qualifications (70.0%), and had received prior ethics training (81.4%). In multivariable analysis, prior ethics training (aOR = 0.27; 95% CI 0.07-0.98; p = 0.046) and the perception that RM is unacceptable (aOR = 0.27; 95% CI 0.07-0.98; p = 0.046) were independently associated with lower odds of self-reported RM.

These amendments follow nearly two decades of implementation and an intensive multilateral process prompted by the global struggle against COVID-19.

While text-based plagiarism detection tools are widely used, the rise of artificial intelligence (AI) has introduced new challenges, particularly in text and image generation and manipulation. We briefly discuss the evolving landscape of plagiarism and the innovations that have come about with the proliferation of AI, focusing on the implications for text and image manipulation in academic writing and research.

This study aims to determine the validity and dimensionality of a novel Academic Misconduct Questionnaire (AMQ) and to explore differences between students who engage in distinct misbehaviours. A diverse sample of health and non-health students replied to the AMQ. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses were conducted using two subsamples. Predictive models were computed for the AMQ and its dimensions. The questionnaire showed good validity and reliability, revealing eight dimensions related to Cheating during (two forms) and prior Exams, Plagiarism, Fraud in Academic Work, Impersonation (assessment), Signature Forgery in attendance sheets and Not Reporting peer misconduct. The predictors of student engagement in each form of misconduct differed, except for perceiving greater peer fraud, which increased the propensity for all misbehaviours.

This study aims to determine the validity and dimensionality of a novel Academic Misconduct Questionnaire (AMQ) and to explore differences between students who engage in distinct misbehaviours. A diverse sample of health and non-health students replied to the AMQ. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses were conducted using two subsamples. Predictive models were computed for the AMQ and its dimensions. The questionnaire showed good validity and reliability, revealing eight dimensions related to Cheating during (two forms) and prior Exams, Plagiarism, Fraud in Academic Work, Impersonation (assessment), Signature Forgery in attendance sheets and Not Reporting peer misconduct. The predictors of student engagement in each form of misconduct differed, except for perceiving greater peer fraud, which increased the propensity for all misbehaviours. Perceiving higher sanctions reduced the propensity to engage in most forms, while gender played a role in half of them. First-year students were more likely to Not Reporting peer misconduct and less likely to disclose Fraud in Academic Work and Signature Forgery than those in more advanced years. Health students scored higher in most misbehaviours, especially compared to Economics/Law, Social Sciences and Arts/Humanities, while the latter two disclosed higher Signature Forgery.

Although retraction notices are issued, retracted studies continue to be cited, facilitating the dissemination of unreliable findings. This study aimed to systematically explore the characteristics of retracted stem cell publications and evaluate the impact of retractions on subsequent citations.<h4>Methods</h4>This study was conducted following the PRISMA guidelines. A comprehensive search of Web of Science, Retraction Watch Database, and PubMed was conducted from their inception through July 25, 2024, to identify retracted stem cell publications. Characteristics including publication details, retraction reasons, and citation counts were extracted. To assess the impact of retraction on subsequent citations, we compared citation patterns between a random sample of retracted papers and matched non-retracted controls from identical journals and issues. Further analysis was conducted to determine whether papers citing retracted articles had an elevated risk of subsequent retraction.

Although retraction notices are issued, retracted studies continue to be cited, facilitating the dissemination of unreliable findings. This study aimed to systematically explore the characteristics of retracted stem cell publications and evaluate the impact of retractions on subsequent citations.<h4>Methods</h4>This study was conducted following the PRISMA guidelines. A comprehensive search of Web of Science, Retraction Watch Database, and PubMed was conducted from their inception through July 25, 2024, to identify retracted stem cell publications. Characteristics including publication details, retraction reasons, and citation counts were extracted. To assess the impact of retraction on subsequent citations, we compared citation patterns between a random sample of retracted papers and matched non-retracted controls from identical journals and issues. Further analysis was conducted to determine whether papers citing retracted articles had an elevated risk of subsequent retraction. Descriptive statistics, chi-squared tests, t-tests, and Mann-Kendall tests were used for data analysis.<h4>Results</h4>The systematic search identified 1421 records, with 517 publications meeting inclusion criteria. Temporal analysis revealed two significant trends: an increasing retraction rate that peaked at 0.84% in 2023 and a declining time-to-retraction (median: 30 months, interquartile range: 13-60; Mann-Kendall, tau = - 0.29; P < 0.001).

Traditional self-reporting methods for identifying misconduct are often limited by social desirability bias, leading to significant underreporting. This study explores the use of an indirect feedback approach to provide a more accurate assessment of academic misconduct among medical students.<h4>Methods</h4>A cross-sectional study was conducted involving 1,622 postgraduate medical students from five medical institutions in Sichuan and Chongqing. Participants completed a structured questionnaire designed to collect demographic information, indirect feedback on observed misconduct, and perceptions of academic pressures. Observed misconduct included data fabrication, plagiarism, and inappropriate authorship. Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS, employing chi-square tests to evaluate associations between demographic variables and reported observations.<h4>Results</h4>Only 2.71% of participants admitted personal involvement in misconduct, whereas 27.11% reported observing such behaviors within their networks. The most frequently observed misconduct occurred during data collection (31.73%) and data processing (29.51%), stages often marked by minimal oversight. Male students, those in higher academic years, and individuals with more publications were significantly more likely to report observed misconduct (p < 0.001). Notably, respondents with no publications reported lower levels of observed misconduct (26.85%) compared to those with 3-5 publications (45.93%). Additionally, respondents identified misconduct among undergraduate peers, research group members, and collaborators, with undergraduate peers accounting for the highest proportion (45.35%).<h4>Conclusion</h4>Indirect feedback revealed a 27.11% prevalence of observed misconduct, compared to only 2.71% self-reported, suggesting underreporting in traditional approaches. This method provides valuable insights into misconduct patterns and at-risk groups, enabling the development of targeted interventions.

A falsified medicine fraudulently misrepresents its identity, composition and/or source, often being ineffective or toxic for patients. Although techniques have been developed to detect falsified medicines, it remains a challenge to trace where- and by whom- the products are manufactured.

A falsified medicine fraudulently misrepresents its identity, composition and/or source, often being ineffective or toxic for patients. Although techniques have been developed to detect falsified medicines, it remains a challenge to trace where- and by whom- the products are manufactured. We aim to discuss plausible biological and physico-chemical analytical techniques that could reveal information about the origin of medical falsifications. We first provide a brief overview on the prevalence, criminal activities, health impacts and (bio)chemical features of falsified medical products.

The way forward in the form of formal RCT integrity assessments in systematic reviews is proposed, and implications of this new initiative are discussed. Future directions include emphasizing ethical and professional standards, providing tailored integrity-specific training, and creating systems to promote research integrity, as improvements in RCT integrity will benefit evidence syntheses.", "scraped_at": "2026-01-19T00:14:36.259343+00:00"}

Previous reviews on retracted publications in obstetrics and gynecology have identified \"article duplication,\" \"plagiarism,\" and \"fabricated results\" as the main reasons for retraction. However, the extent of retracted articles in the literature on medically assisted reproduction (MAR) remains unclear. This systematic review aimed to assess the number and characteristics of retracted articles in the field of MAR.<h4>Methods</h4>The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines were followed for this study. A comprehensive literature search was conducted on the PubMed database from 1993 to February 2023, limited to English articles and including all 283 terms from the International Glossary on Infertility and Fertility Care. To identify retracted studies, a specific query combining the 283 terms from the glossary with a retraction-related keyword was used. Only studies focused on MAR and involving human subjects were included.<h4>Results</h4>The electronic search yielded a total of 523,067 records in the field of infertility and fertility care. Among these, a total of 2,458 records were identified as retracted. The citation retraction rate was found to be 0.47% (2,458/523,067; 95%CI 0.45-0.49), and the citation retraction rate for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) was 0.20% (93/45,616; 95%CI 0.16-0.25). A total of 39 retracted articles specifically related to MAR were identified. Among these, 41.0% were RCTs (<i>n</i> = 16), 15.4% were reviews (<i>n</i> = 6), and 10.3% were retrospective studies (<i>n</i> = 4) or prospective studies (<i>n</i> = 4). Most of the retractions occurred shortly after publication, with \"plagiarism\" being the most common reason for retraction, followed by \"duplicate publication.\"<h4>Discussion</h4>The issue of retraction exists within the field of infertility and fertility care, including MAR. Our findings indicate that scientific misconduct, particularly plagiarism and duplicate publication, are the primary causes of retraction in MAR. Despite finding that the proportion of retracted citations is low, promoting scientific integrity should be a priority. The consequences of article retractions have significant implications for patient care and the scientific community. Hence, it is crucial to prioritize thorough screening of manuscripts before publication to maintain research integrity.<h4>Systematic review registration</h4>https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/display_record.php?RecordID=185769, PROSPERO, identifier: CRD42020185769.", "authors": "Minetto S, Zanirato M, Makieva S, Marzanati D, Esposito S, Pisaturo V, Costa M, Candiani M, Papaleo E, Alteri A.", "journal": "", "pub_year": "2023", "type": "article", "source": "Europe_PMC", "filename": "europmc_37588117.html", "text": "Title: Surveillance of clinical research integrity in medically assisted reproduction: a systematic review of retracted publications.\n\nPMID: 37588117\n\nDOI: 10.3389/fpubh.2023.1210951\n\nPublication Year: 2023\n\nAuthors: Minetto S, Zanirato M, Makieva S, Marzanati D, Esposito S, Pisaturo V, Costa M, Candiani M, Papaleo E, Alteri A.\n\n\nAbstract:\n<h4>Background and purpose</h4>Retraction is a significant consequence of scientific research, resulting from various factors ranging from unintentional errors to intentional misconduct.

Our findings indicate that scientific misconduct, particularly plagiarism and duplicate publication, are the primary causes of retraction in MAR. Despite finding that the proportion of retracted citations is low, promoting scientific integrity should be a priority. The consequences of article retractions have significant implications for patient care and the scientific community. Hence, it is crucial to prioritize thorough screening of manuscripts before publication to maintain research integrity.<h4>Systematic review registration</h4>https://www.crd.york.ac.", "scraped_at": "2026-01-19T00:14:36.260357+00:00"}
