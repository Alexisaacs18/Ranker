While these devices enable high-quality recordings, a fundamental mechanical mismatch between rigid materials and soft brain tissue leads to inflammation, gliosis, and signal instability.

It emphasizes graft preparation and fixation without the need for additional biomaterials, offering a potential alternative in the surgical treatment of irreparable massive rotator cuff defects.", "scraped_at": "2026-01-19T00:14:42.073282+00:00"}

This transition altered students' physical habits, posture, and daily routines, potentially increasing the risk of musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs).

The presence of dsDNA raises bridging forces to 34 ± 8 pN, which revert to ~10 pN upon adding external ssDNA. In line with these single-molecule results, protamine-dsDNA mixtures form solid-like aggregates and require ssDNA addition to become liquid droplets. Conversely, adding dsDNA slows the fusion of protamine-ssDNA droplets. This work reports systematic characterization of bridging forces and shows that the ssDNA-to-dsDNA ratio can tune their magnitude in protein-DNA condensates.", "scraped_at": "2026-01-19T00:14:55.493153+00:00"}

{"pmid": "41522697", "type": "article", "source": "PubMed_US", "title": "Revision Total Hip Arthroplasty with Femoral Component Retention.", "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Revision total hip arthroplasty (THA) for isolated polyethylene exchange or acetabular revision with retention of the femoral component can present a challenge for adequate exposure. A systematic approach to a proper release can facilitate exposure and reduce the risk of iatrogenic complications.\nDESCRIPTION: The posterior approach is an extensile and versatile approach for revision THA. After incising the fascia and iliotibial band, the insertion of the gluteus maximus is fully released. After releasing any scar along the inferior gluteus medius, a retractor is placed to hold the muscle belly cranially. The leg is gently internally rotated to place the posterior capsule and external rotators under tension while these structures are released from the posterior femur and along the neck of the femoral component. Curved scissors can be utilized to identify the psoas sheath and to release the inferior capsule while protecting the iliopsoas tendon. Scar tissue is resected from inside the hip joint, and a pocket is made in the anterior capsule to allow retractor placement above the equator of the acetabulum in order to hold the mobilized proximal femur anteriorly. An inferior retractor is then placed under the transverse acetabular ligament. This systematic approach allows adequate visualization of the acetabular component for revision.\nALTERNATIVES: Nonoperative treatment should be attempted first, depending on the diagnosis and its associated natural history. Once nonoperative treatment has been exhausted and revision THA is indicated, the anterior and direct lateral approaches can be considered. If the femoral component needs revision on the basis of intraoperative assessment, the anterior approach presents substantial difficulty in femoral exposure, with a higher risk of iatrogenic fracture. The direct lateral approach commonly leads to abductor weakness and a Trendelenburg gait.\nRATIONALE: Common indications for revision THA with femoral component retention include wear and/or osteolysis, adverse local tissue reaction, recurrent instability, and aseptic acetabular loosening. Adequate exposure is essential to facilitate revision THA with femoral component retention and to minimize the risk of iatrogenic injury.\nEXPECTED OUTCOMES: Survivorship free from re-revision at 2 years is >80% for both isolated polyethylene exchange and acetabular revision. There is a trend toward higher failure rates when retaining the acetabular component. Risk factors for failure include damage to the locking mechanism; femoral head erosion into the cup, damaging the metal; and a mispositioned acetabular component.\nIMPORTANT TIPS: A systematic approach to releases is essential for adequate exposure with a retained femoral component. Systematic releases include fully releasing the gluteus maximus insertion, continuing the iliotibial band incision distally, fully releasing the external rotators, and removing scar tissue within the joint.Keeping the hip extended and the knee flexed with a finger posteriorly is important to protect the sciatic nerve during the release of the posterior capsule. The hip can then be dislocated in a controlled manner to reduce the risk of iatrogenic injury.Be prepared for bleeding from perforating arteries during subvastus elevation.Rest the leg on a padded Mayo stand in slight internal rotation once the proximal femur is retracted anteriorly.Ensure proper component alignment, component stability, and hip stability to confirm that femoral component retention is indicated. Repair of the posterior capsule contributes substantially to postoperative stability.Precautions should be implemented postoperatively to reduce the risk of dislocation. A hip abduction brace can be considered for patients at a high risk of instability.Active ankle dorsiflexion should be assessed in the post-anesthesia unit to evaluate for sciatic nerve injury and to differentiate the cause of a foot drop if discovered on postoperative day 1.\nACRONYMS AND ABBREVIATIONS: AP = anterior-posteriorCT = computerized tomographyCRP = c-reactive proteinESR = erythrocyte sedimentation rateFDA = Food & Drug AdministrationHR = Hazard ratioIT = Iliotibial bandMSIS = Musculoskeletal Infection SocietyOR = Odds ratioTHA = total hip arthroplastyrTHA = revision total hip arthroplasty.", "authors": "Everett G Young, Ahab G Alnemri, Amar S Vadhera, Neil P Sheth, Krishna Kiran Eachempati", "journal": "JBJS essential surgical techniques", "pub_date": "2026", "doi": "10.2106/JBJS.ST.24.00009", "filename": "pubmed_41522697.html", "text": "Title: Revision Total Hip Arthroplasty with Femoral Component Retention.\n\nPMID: 41522697\n\nDOI: 10.2106/JBJS.ST.24.00009\n\nJournal: JBJS essential surgical techniques\n\nPublication Date: 2026\n\nAuthors: Everett G Young, Ahab G Alnemri, Amar S Vadhera, Neil P Sheth, Krishna Kiran Eachempati\n\n\nAbstract:\nBACKGROUND: Revision total hip arthroplasty (THA) for isolated polyethylene exchange or acetabular revision with retention of the femoral component can present a challenge for adequate exposure. A systematic approach to a proper release can facilitate exposure and reduce the risk of iatrogenic complications.\nDESCRIPTION: The posterior approach is an extensile and versatile approach for revision THA. After incising the fascia and iliotibial band, the insertion of the gluteus maximus is fully released. After releasing any scar along the inferior gluteus medius, a retractor is placed to hold the muscle belly cranially. The leg is gently internally rotated to place the posterior capsule and external rotators under tension while these structures are released from the posterior femur and along the neck of the femoral component. Curved scissors can be utilized to identify the psoas sheath and to release the inferior capsule while protecting the iliopsoas tendon. Scar tissue is resected from inside the hip joint, and a pocket is made in the anterior capsule to allow retractor placement above the equator of the acetabulum in order to hold the mobilized proximal femur anteriorly. An inferior retractor is then placed under the transverse acetabular ligament. This systematic approach allows adequate visualization of the acetabular component for revision.\nALTERNATIVES: Nonoperative treatment should be attempted first, depending on the diagnosis and its associated natural history. Once nonoperative treatment has been exhausted and revision THA is indicated, the anterior and direct lateral approaches can be considered. If the femoral component needs revision on the basis of intraoperative assessment, the anterior approach presents substantial difficulty in femoral exposure, with a higher risk of iatrogenic fracture. The direct lateral approach commonly leads to abductor weakness and a Trendelenburg gait.\nRATIONALE: Common indications for revision THA with femoral component retention include wear and/or osteolysis, adverse local tissue reaction, recurrent instability, and aseptic acetabular loosening. Adequate exposure is essential to facilitate revision THA with femoral component retention and to minimize the risk of iatrogenic injury.\nEXPECTED OUTCOMES: Survivorship free from re-revision at 2 years is >80% for both isolated polyethylene exchange and acetabular revision. There is a trend toward higher failure rates when retaining the acetabular component. Risk factors for failure include damage to the locking mechanism; femoral head erosion into the cup, damaging the metal; and a mispositioned acetabular component.", "scraped_at": "2026-01-19T00:15:01.738972+00:00"}
{"pmid": "41522696", "type": "article", "source": "PubMed_US", "title": "Quadriceps Coxae-Sparing Modified Posterior Approach to the Hip Joint for Hemiarthroplasty.", "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Various approaches have been described for hip arthroplasty1-3. The posterior approach to the hip remains a popular choice for hemiarthroplasty1. In the classic description, it involves detachment of the short external rotators, which include the quadriceps coxae (QC) (i.e., piriformis, superior gemellus, obturator internus, and inferior gemellus) along with the obturator externus and quadratus femoris (as needed). Since the QC are important for joint stability, detachment during the approach is associated with higher rates of postoperative dislocations4, even following subsequent surgical repair of the QC. In the study by Stähelin et al.5, 15 of 20 repairs involving the QC had failed by 3 months postoperatively, primarily because the repair site could not withstand the forces of normal weight-bearing during the healing phase. Various muscle-sparing modifications of the conventional approach have been described to reduce the propensity for prosthetic dislocation6-9. Hanly et al.9 described the SPAIRE (Sparing Piriformis and Internus, Repair Externus) technique. This minimally invasive modified posterior approach enables the preservation of the QC, possibly representing the greatest extent of muscle and tendon preservation. The advantages of this QC-sparing technique have been demonstrated in clinical studies of hemiarthroplasty10,11 and total hip arthroplasty12.\nDESCRIPTION: The patient is anesthetized and placed in a lateral decubitus position. Bolsters are utilized over the pubis and sacral areas to provide stable pelvic orientation. The contralateral limb is flexed at the hip (∼45°) and knee (90°), with adequate padding under the fibular head and lateral malleolus. Another padded bolster is placed between the legs to keep the topmost lower limb in neutral to slight abduction at the hip. The operative limb is flexed at the hip (∼30°), and a 10 to 15-cm straight skin incision is marked on the lateral aspect of hip, centered on the posterolateral tip of the greater trochanter. The deep fascia is opened distally to proximally, incised distally with scissors, and separated proximally with finger dissection. This step creates an intermuscular plane between the gluteus maximus posteriorly and tensor fasciae latae anteriorly. A Charnley hip retractor is applied. Internal rotation of the hip allows identification of the posterior border of the gluteus medius and short external rotators. The fat pad over the QC is swept medially with an abdominal sponge to identify the muscles. A plane is identified between the quadratus femoris and inferior gemellus. Next, a plane is developed between the QC and posterior hip capsule with use of a blunt hemostat from inferior to superior. Abduction of the hip just beyond neutral relaxes the QC and allows superior retraction. The quadratus femoris is detached from the trochanteric crest with use of a diathermy needle until the lesser trochanter is visualized. A capsulotomy is performed in a lazy L-shaped manner, with the first limb of the incision along the distal margin of the QC and the second along the base of the femoral neck. The second limb of the incision raises the musculocapsular flap consisting of the obturator externus along the osseous margin with use of a diathermy needle. This musculocapsular flap is tagged with sutures, which helps in its retraction posteriorly to protect the sciatic nerve and later aids in repair. Bipolar hemiarthroplasty is performed in a conventional manner. The musculocapsular flap is repaired transosseously, and the wound is closed in a layered fashion.\nALTERNATIVES: Alternatives to this QC-sparing technique include the use of a conventional posterior approach, piriformis-preserving posterior approach, direct lateral approach, modified lateral approach, or direct anterior approach.\nRATIONALE: Preservation of the QC helps improve prosthetic hip stability in internal rotation, possibly because of the preserved proprioception. A minimally invasive approach reduces recovery time during rehabilitation. Preservation of the QC does not hinder visualization or result in component malposition12.\nEXPECTED OUTCOMES: Ball et al.10 compared the use of a modified muscle-sparing posterior approach versus a standard lateral approach. The authors reported comparable Oxford Hip Scores at 120 days (p = 0.25). Patient function and mobility were similar at 3 days and 120 days, regardless of the surgical approach. Length of hospital stay and return to pre-fracture place of residence were similar. Mortality rates and quality of life were also similar at 120 days postoperatively. Patients who underwent the modified muscle-sparing posterior approach experienced less pain during the early postoperative period. The mean score on the numeric pain rating scale was 4.4 (standard deviation, 2.8) among patients who underwent the modified muscle-sparing posterior approach versus 5.4 (standard deviation, 3.0) among patients who underwent the standard lateral approach (p = 0.04).\nIMPORTANT TIPS: Place a padded bolster between the legs to keep the topmost lower limb in neutral to slight abduction at the hip.Develop a plane between the QC and posterior hip capsule with use of a blunt hemostat or a Cobb elevator from inferior to superior in order to help mobilize the QC and release their capsular attachments.Hip abduction just beyond neutral relaxes the QC and allows insertion of a Hohmann retractor deep to the QC in order to protect and lever them superiorly.A small Langenbeck retractor inserted deep to the QC protects them from shredding during broaching. Internal rotation at the hip beyond 90° (in 90° flexion and neutral adduction/abduction) further protects the QC from harm.", "authors": "Sumit Arora, Prajwal Gupta, Mudit Sharma, Manoj Kumar Meena, Shahrukh Khan, Abhishek Kashyap", "journal": "JBJS essential surgical techniques", "pub_date": "2026", "doi": "10.2106/JBJS.ST.25.00008", "filename": "pubmed_41522696.html", "text": "Title: Quadriceps Coxae-Sparing Modified Posterior Approach to the Hip Joint for Hemiarthroplasty.\n\nPMID: 41522696\n\nDOI: 10.2106/JBJS.ST.25.00008\n\nJournal: JBJS essential surgical techniques\n\nPublication Date: 2026\n\nAuthors: Sumit Arora, Prajwal Gupta, Mudit Sharma, Manoj Kumar Meena, Shahrukh Khan, Abhishek Kashyap\n\n\nAbstract:\nBACKGROUND: Various approaches have been described for hip arthroplasty1-3.

In macaques, which share similar swallowing kinematics with humans, the base of the tongue and the food bolus are hypothesized to be driven into the oropharynx by a hydraulic mechanism, at the core of which is elevation and protraction of the hyoid. Here, the musculoskeletal mechanisms driving these hyoid movements are experimentally evaluated in macaque primates.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: We integrate XROMM-based measures of mandibular, cranial, and hyolingual kinematics with electromyography of suprahyoid and lingual muscles to evaluate the underlying kinetics of swallowing.\nRESULTS: All suprahyoid muscles rotate during swallowing and tongue base retraction. Hyoid elevation and protraction are powered by concentric activation and rotation of posterior mylohyoid and both digastric muscle bellies, followed by concentric activation of geniohyoid muscle. Genioglossus is predominantly active early in swallowing.\nDISCUSSION: Morphology, function, and coordination of suprahyoid and lingual muscles are especially important determinants of swallowing performance in macaques, and probably humans. Here, we characterize suprahyoid muscle biomechanics within a dynamic framework of architectural gear ratios and pulley systems that optimize hyoid elevation velocity to quickly \"prime the pump\" and subsequent hyoid protraction power and/or force to drive the hydraulic mechanism of tongue base retraction.

Traditional open and mini-open approaches allow for ventral canal decompression but are associated with high morbidity, including pulmonary complications, chest tube placement, and frequent need for fusion. Full-endoscopic thoracic discectomy has emerged as an ultra-minimally invasive alternative with reduced complications and faster recovery, but its application to midline or calcified thoracic discs remains technically demanding.\nCASE PRESENTATION: We report the case of a 54-year-old man with progressive chest wall pain and lower-extremity hyperreflexia who was found to have a T6 to T7 central disc herniation with mild calcification and spinal cord signal change. The patient underwent an outpatient right-sided full-endoscopic transforaminal discectomy. Complete decompression was achieved without spinal cord retraction or manipulation. The patient had complete resolution of his preoperative pain and was discharged home within 2 hours.\nDISCUSSION: Compared with open thoracic discectomy, endoscopic approaches significantly lower complication rates, blood loss, hospital stay, and cost while preserving motion segments.

Despite multiple established repair strategies, recurrence rates remain high. We present a novel open retromuscular repair technique using a 3D funnel mesh.\nMETHODS: The technique involves retrorectus dissection, transversus abdominis release (TAR), lateralisation of the stomal conduit, and retromuscular placement of a 3D funnel mesh. A second flat mesh reinforces the remaining retromuscular space. Abdominoplasty was performed where excess skin or fat contributed to the parastomal ‘bulge’.\nRESULTS: Fifteen patients underwent repair (median age 59 years, BMI 33.8 kg/m²). Nine had a colostomy and six an ileostomy. Five (33%) had a recurrent parastomal hernia, and 13 (87%) had concomitant incisional hernia. The median combined transverse defect width was 11.9 cm (IQR 10.4–12.2). Abdominoplasty was performed in 13 patients (87%).

This retrospective cohort study aimed to assess the incidence and severity of OIARR in Class III patients treated nonsurgically with lingual high precision fixed appliances (HPFAs) and significant anterior tooth retraction.\nMETHODS: Eligible for inclusion were adolescent and adult Class III patients treated with lingual HPFAs (WIN, DW Lingual Systems GmbH) and extraction of lower premolars, who completed treatment between 2015 and 2024. Pre- (T0) and post-treatment (T1) panoramic radiographs were measured for root and crown lengths, with relative root resorption (rRR, %) calculated for each tooth.

This article presents successful ways to organize and prepare a manuscript for submission to a nursing scientific journal. A discussion on editor decisions and ways to respond to reviewer comments and editor decisions is presented. Also discussed are unethical behaviors in scholarly writing including the problems and outcomes for authors who submit plagiarized work, duplicate submissions, using generative artificial intelligence to create a manuscript, and retractions of published work.", "scraped_at": "2026-01-19T00:15:36.853201+00:00"}

Transoral robotic surgery (TORS) through the oral pharynx mitigates these risks. Free flap (FF) inset following resection is challenging and may require open approaches, negating the benefits of TORS resection. We present our case series utilizing the single port (SP) robot for FF inset, which has improved visualization and functionality compared with a multiport robot.\nMETHODS: A retrospective review of robotic FF inset following TORS using the SP from 2021 to 2022. Patient and tumor characteristics as well as operative and postoperative details were gathered.\nRESULTS: Five cases were performed with an average age of 62.4 (50-78) years. Radial forearm FF was used in three cases and anterolateral thigh flap in two. Mean operative time was 528 (423-742) minutes with an average ischemia time of 156.6 (124-198) min.

While tissue expansion of the fronto-scalp flap offers a viable reconstructive option, the lengthy expansion period and the issue of post-expansion flap retraction necessitate further solutions.\nOBJECTIVE: We conducted a prospective, comparative clinical study to investigate the role of Botulinum toxin in the expansion of fronto-scalp flaps.\nMETHOD: Between December 2019 and December 2024, 40 patients with large upper facial or scalp lesions were enrolled and randomly assigned to either the experimental group or the control group. Control group patients underwent tissue expansion combined with postoperative laser hair removal. Experimental group patients received the same tissue expansion and laser therapy, supplemented with Botulinum toxin injections administered both preoperatively (prior to expander implantation) and postoperatively in the forehead and scalp regions. We analyzed and compared parameters including expansion efficiency, post-expansion flap retraction force, postoperative pain scores, and complication rates between the two groups.\nRESULTS: Baseline characteristics showed no significant differences between the two groups before expander implantation.

While prior research has extensively examined the determinants of vaccination at the population-level, less attention has been paid to the mechanisms generating disparities across socioeconomic status (SES) groups. A fundamental cause theory perspective suggests that vaccination disparities driven by misinformation are due to unequal access to resources that enable higher-SES parents to avoid the influence of such misinformation. By contrast, a neoliberal cultural frames of parenting perspective suggests that higher-SES parents, in trying to avoid risks for their child, would be more receptive to inaccurate claims that arise outside the mainstream medical and scientific community. We test hypotheses from these two perspectives using 22 birth cohorts of Danish national health registry data (1990-2011) analyzing uptake of children's first dose of the measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine (MMR1) by parental education level in the context of three major vaccine misinformation events: two promoting and one correcting misinformation. We find that educational disparities in MMR1 uptake emerged following a 1993 national radio broadcast that falsely linked the vaccine to autism and helped catalyze anti-vaccine activism in Denmark. Children of parents with the lowest education were most severely impacted, and these disparities persisted through the 1998 publication and 2010 retraction of Andrew Wakefield's widely publicized MMR vaccine and autism study.

They were fabricated from titanium powder by selective laser melting. Graduated drillings were performed using a pilot bur followed by two larger ones; infrared thermography was used to record the temperature of the drill upon exit and the peak temperature of the specimen right after the bur's retraction.\nRESULTS: The rise in bone temperature (mean ± standard deviation) while drilling through the CLA (INT) guide was 13.2 ± 3.6 (9.0 ± 3.4)°C for Drill 1, 4.3 ± 1.0 (2.1 ± 1.0)°C for Drill 2, and 2.1 ± 0.6 (0.4 ± 0.5)°C for Drill 3; the differences were statistically significant (p < 0.0032).

Optimal management remains controversial. We report exoscope-assisted intradural far-lateral resection of a retro-odontoid pseudotumor without fusion using the lateral position.\nCASE DESCRIPTION: A 69-year-old male presented with progressive motor weakness and gait disturbance. MRI showed a retro-odontoid pseudotumor with severe spinal cord compression and intramedullary high signal intensity at C1-C2. Radiographs showed minimal atlantoaxial instability. We performed pseudotumor resection through the left intradural far-lateral approach with the patient in the right lateral decubitus position. Head fixation without rotation maintained consistent surgical orientation. This positioning allowed gravity-assisted spontaneous spinal cord displacement, avoiding active neural retraction. The exoscope provided clear oblique visualization of the ventral spinal cord from the posterolateral corridor. We sectioned the dentate ligaments and the left C2 posterior nerve root to expand operating space. The ventral dura was incised and internal debulking achieved partial resection with adequate decompression. Neuroendoscopic examination confirmed sufficient decompression. The patient was discharged without complications. Histopathology confirmed inflammatory tissue consistent with retro-odontoid pseudotumor. At three-month follow-up, neurological function improved significantly. At two years postoperatively, no symptom recurrence was noted.\nCONCLUSION: Partial resection achieved effective neural decompression with favorable neurological recovery while preserving spinal mobility.

Psychological mechanisms linking CBSD and criminality are yet not well understood. This study examines psychological/personality factors contributing to criminal tendencies in individuals with CBSD.\nMETHODS: An online survey recruited participants through social media, websites, and academic institutions. Eligible participants were ≥18 years with German language skills. Ethical approval was granted by Hannover Medical School. Measures included the Pathological Buying Screener (PBS), Materialistic Value Scale, Big Five Inventory, Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale, the Dirty Dozen for Dark Triad traits, and a self-developed questionnaire on criminal behavior.\nRESULTS: Forty-three participants scored above (CBSD+) and 166 participants below (CBSD-) the PBS cutoff for CBSD. The CBSD+ group showed higher materialism, lower self-esteem, elevated Dark Triad traits, and more criminal behaviors compared to the CBSD- group. Nearly 70% of the CBSD+ group reported at least one criminal behavior. A multiple linear regression (enter method) identified higher PBS scores, younger age, and lower extraversion as predictors of more criminal buying-shopping-related behaviors.\nCONCLUSION: The findings reveal the intricate factors contributing to criminal behavior in CBSD. The lack of significant association between neuroticism, dark personality features and the amount of criminal behaviors needs further investigation.

Interleukin-17 (IL-17) plays a critical role in immune defense, tissue repair, inflammation, and tumor progression. Given its immunomodulatory functions, this study aimed to investigate whether single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in IL17-related genes contribute to susceptibility and clinical manifestations of orbital autoimmune diseases. A total of 60 patients with orbital autoimmune disease and 60 healthy controls were recruited. Candidate SNPs in IL17A, IL17F, IL17RA, and IL17RC were selected based on known hotspots, including 500 bp upstream and downstream flanking regions. Associations between SNPs and disease status, as well as clinical features such as pain, diplopia, conjunctival inflammation, and eyelid retraction, were analyzed using chi-square or Fisher's exact tests. The analysis revealed that rs9791323 in the promoter region of the IL17A gene was significantly associated with disease susceptibility (p = 0.045) but not with specific clinical features.

In IL17F, rs9463772 was associated with pain (p = 0.005), while rs4715290 and rs11465530 were linked to eyelid retraction (p = 0.014 and 0.030, respectively). Three SNPs in IL17RA-rs4819553, rs4819958, and rs4819554-were significantly associated with conjunctival inflammation (p = 0.012). The IL17RC SNP rs708567 was also related to eyelid retraction (p = 0.049). In conclusion, rs9791323 in IL17A may contribute to disease susceptibility, while other IL17-related SNPs appear to influence specific clinical features.

Interleukin-17 (IL-17) plays a critical role in immune defense, tissue repair, inflammation, and tumor progression. Given its immunomodulatory functions, this study aimed to investigate whether single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in IL17-related genes contribute to susceptibility and clinical manifestations of orbital autoimmune diseases. A total of 60 patients with orbital autoimmune disease and 60 healthy controls were recruited. Candidate SNPs in IL17A, IL17F, IL17RA, and IL17RC were selected based on known hotspots, including 500 bp upstream and downstream flanking regions. Associations between SNPs and disease status, as well as clinical features such as pain, diplopia, conjunctival inflammation, and eyelid retraction, were analyzed using chi-square or Fisher's exact tests. The analysis revealed that rs9791323 in the promoter region of the IL17A gene was significantly associated with disease susceptibility (p = 0.045) but not with specific clinical features. Other SNPs were found to correlate with distinct symptoms: in IL17A, rs3804513 was associated with pain (p = 0.012); rs3819024 and rs2275913 with diplopia (p = 0.007 and 0.028, respectively); and rs8193036 with both diplopia (p = 0.002) and eyelid retraction (p = 0.033). In IL17F, rs9463772 was associated with pain (p = 0.005), while rs4715290 and rs11465530 were linked to eyelid retraction (p = 0.014 and 0.030, respectively).

It is characterized by redundant skin and subcutaneous adipose tissue that overhangs the cesarean scar, producing a contour irregularity that ranges from a mild suprapubic bulge to a large apron extending below the mons pubis. This deformity affects both obese and nonobese patients and is frequently dismissed as a cosmetic concern or attributed to weight gain. However, it can cause physical discomfort, skin irritation, and considerable psychological distress, negatively affecting body image and self-esteem. We propose that the cesarean apron results primarily from incomplete or absent closure of the Scarpa fascia during cesarean wound repair. The Scarpa fascia is a fibroelastic membranous layer that separates the superficial (Camper's layer) and deep subcutaneous fat layers of the anterior abdominal wall. We also propose that when left open, the fascial edges retract, creating a potential space that allows deep fat to herniate upward into the superficial plane, producing a pseudolipoma-like bulge. As healing progresses, fibrosis and tissue contractions above and below the gap lead to scar tethering and depression, resulting in a persistent contour deformity. In some patients, the lower fascial edge retracts downward, pulling the mons pubis caudally and contributing to its descent or ptosis. A four-grade classification a system is outlined to describe the severity of this deformity: grade 1 involves a mild suprapubic bulge with minimal fat excess; grade 2 shows moderate bulging covering the scar; grade 3 presents a large apron extending below the scar with infraumbilical rectus diastasis; and grade 4 features a large apron extending to or below the mons pubis with generalized abdominal laxity and deep scar depression. Treatment options range from liposuction and limited scar revision for milder cases to mini- or full abdominoplasty with rectus plication for advanced deformities. Routine closure of the Scarpa fascia, a standard practice in abdominoplasty but rarely performed in obstetrics, can restore fascial continuity, reduces dead space, strengthens the wound, and helps prevent postoperative contour irregularities. This simple and rapid modification of cesarean technique can improve long-term esthetic and functional outcomes without increasing operative morbidity.

Qiliqiangxin capsules (QLQX), a traditional Chinese medicine approved in China for the treatment of heart failure, have exhibited potential benefits in reducing cardiovascular death. However, its direct effects on platelet activation and thrombosis remain unclear.\nMETHODS AND RESULTS: Ex vivo platelet function assays demonstrated that oral QLQX inhibited agonist‑induced aggregation in platelet‑rich plasma (PRP) from chronic heart failure (CHF) patients and dose-dependently suppressed washed platelet aggregation in wild‑type mice. In parallel, QLQX administration attenuated platelet spreading and clot retraction in washed platelets from both patients with CHF and wild-type mice, and reduced ex vivo thrombus formation area in a microfluidic whole‑blood perfusion under arterial shear stress.

Qiliqiangxin capsules (QLQX), a traditional Chinese medicine approved in China for the treatment of heart failure, have exhibited potential benefits in reducing cardiovascular death. However, its direct effects on platelet activation and thrombosis remain unclear.\nMETHODS AND RESULTS: Ex vivo platelet function assays demonstrated that oral QLQX inhibited agonist‑induced aggregation in platelet‑rich plasma (PRP) from chronic heart failure (CHF) patients and dose-dependently suppressed washed platelet aggregation in wild‑type mice. In parallel, QLQX administration attenuated platelet spreading and clot retraction in washed platelets from both patients with CHF and wild-type mice, and reduced ex vivo thrombus formation area in a microfluidic whole‑blood perfusion under arterial shear stress. Flow cytometry analysis revealed that QLQX did not affect the surface expression levels of the major platelet receptors, but reduced the activation of αIIbβ3 and P-selectin exposure induced by thrombin in mouse platelets. In vivo experiments demonstrated that QLQX treatment inhibited FeCl₃-induced thrombus formation in mesenteric arterioles, reduced collagen/epinephrine-induced pulmonary embolism, and mitigated microvascular thrombosis during myocardial ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury, without increasing bleeding in mice. RNA sequencing of platelets from QLQX- versus vehicle-treated mice identified differentially expressed genes enriched in the calcium signaling pathway, and functional assays demonstrated that QLQX inhibited agonist-induced platelet Ca²⁺ influx and PKC phosphorylation.\nCONCLUSION: QLQX inhibits platelet activation and thrombosis by targeting Ca²⁺ influx and PKC signaling, supporting its potential therapeutic value in preventing thrombotic complications.\nSUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1186/s12959-025-00823-8.", "scraped_at": "2026-01-19T00:16:12.001679+00:00"}

This study aimed to detect fungal spoilage in RPP by integrating non-targeted analysis (NTA) and targeted analysis (TA) of non-polar metabolites using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. NTA revealed significant differences in free fatty acid profiles between unspoiled and fungal-spoiled RPP (p < 0.05), specifically due to Alternaria alternata and Colletotrichum acutatum infections. Partial least squares discriminant analysis distinguished the groups and identified palmitic, linoleic, and oleic acids as key markers.

This study compared phase-specific electromyographic (EMG) activity of scapular muscles during four protraction-retraction exercises.

Exercise order was randomized, and sufficient rest intervals were provided to minimize fatigue effects. Surface electromyography was recorded from six scapular muscles and normalized to maximal voluntary isometric contraction. The study was registered on CRIS (KCT0010032). (3) Results: Single-leg PUP showed the greatest serratus anterior (SA) activation, with increases of approximately 30% in protraction, 20-25% in isometric, and 15-20% in retraction. STD variations elicited higher trapezius activation, especially during large scapular excursions. The UT/SA ratio was significantly lower in PUP conditions (η2p = 0.544), reflecting a more favorable stabilization pattern.

Exhibits Potent Antiplatelet and Antithrombotic Effects by Modulating MAPK and PI3K/AKT Signaling Pathways and Inhibiting Ferric Chloride-Induced Thrombosis.", "abstract": "Background: Cardiovascular diseases, driven by platelet hyperactivation and thrombosis, remain the leading global cause of death. Excessive platelet activation contributes to atherosclerosis and thrombo-inflammatory disorders, underscoring the urgent need for safer and more effective antiplatelet agents. Objectives:Xanthium strumarium L. (X. strumarium) has been reported to exhibit a wide range of pharmacological effects, including anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activities. However, its antiplatelet and antithrombotic effects remain unexplored. Therefore, the present study aimed to comprehensively evaluate the antiplatelet and antithrombotic effects of X. strumarium through integrated in vitro and in vivo experiments. Methods: The principal bioactive compounds present in the X. strumarium extract were identified through GC-MS analysis. In vitro antiplatelet effects were evaluated via light transmission aggregometry, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), ATP and calcium mobilization assays, αIIbβ3 binding assay, clot retraction assay, and Western blotting. In vivo ferric chloride-induced (FeCl3) murine thrombus model was established to evaluate thrombogenesis. Results: Our results demonstrated that X. strumarium at 25, 50, or 100 μg/mL significantly inhibited collagen, ADP, U46619, and thrombin-induced platelet aggregation.

Excessive platelet activation contributes to atherosclerosis and thrombo-inflammatory disorders, underscoring the urgent need for safer and more effective antiplatelet agents. Objectives:Xanthium strumarium L. (X. strumarium) has been reported to exhibit a wide range of pharmacological effects, including anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activities. However, its antiplatelet and antithrombotic effects remain unexplored. Therefore, the present study aimed to comprehensively evaluate the antiplatelet and antithrombotic effects of X. strumarium through integrated in vitro and in vivo experiments. Methods: The principal bioactive compounds present in the X. strumarium extract were identified through GC-MS analysis. In vitro antiplatelet effects were evaluated via light transmission aggregometry, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), ATP and calcium mobilization assays, αIIbβ3 binding assay, clot retraction assay, and Western blotting. In vivo ferric chloride-induced (FeCl3) murine thrombus model was established to evaluate thrombogenesis. Results: Our results demonstrated that X. strumarium at 25, 50, or 100 μg/mL significantly inhibited collagen, ADP, U46619, and thrombin-induced platelet aggregation. SEM revealed that X. strumarium pretreatment markedly preserved the resting platelet morphology and inhibited collagen-induced activation and shape changes. Further, the granule secretion, integrin-αIIbβ3 signaling, and the MAPK and PI3K/Akt pathways were also concentration-dependently inhibited. The in vivo blood flow rate and mice survival were improved, and H&E staining further revealed a concentration-dependent prevention of arterial occlusion following X. strumarium treatment.

This is our experience with laparoscopic gastrostomy tube (LGt) insertion in newborns diagnosed with LGOA.\nMETHODS: A retrospective review of medical records for cases of LGOA that underwent laparoscopic-assisted Seldinger gastrostomy placement between 2019 and 2024. A 5 mm camera and 3 mm instruments were used to place transabdominal sutures to the stomach, which was then punctured with a needle and insufflated with 2 ml of air.

The sutures were tied extra-corporeally.\nRESULTS: Eight newborns with LGOA underwent LGt (median gestation 36.5 weeks, age 2 days, birth weight 2.2 kg. Seven neonates were fitted with a 12Fr gastrostomy tube, while one premature infant (33-week gestation, 1.4 kg) had an 8Fr Foley catheter.

The sutures were tied extra-corporeally.\nRESULTS: Eight newborns with LGOA underwent LGt (median gestation 36.5 weeks, age 2 days, birth weight 2.2 kg. Seven neonates were fitted with a 12Fr gastrostomy tube, while one premature infant (33-week gestation, 1.4 kg) had an 8Fr Foley catheter. A contrast study was performed the following day to confirm the correct position of the feeding tube, and feeding was initiated after 24 h. There were no immediate complications or instances of tube displacement observed. Ultimately, all patients successfully underwent staged thoracoscopic repair of their LGOA using external traction sutures.\nCONCLUSIONS: The insertion of LGt proved to be safe, in our series despite the tiny size of their stomachs. This minimally invasive approach offers several advantages, including excellent visualization, reduced liver retraction, and less manipulation of the stomach. Additionally, it may lead to fewer adhesions, which is an important factor to consider since many patients with LGOA will require fundoplication in the future.", "scraped_at": "2026-01-19T00:16:36.971961+00:00"}

Histories of trauma and victimization are closely tied to emotional and behavioral dysregulation, which may lead juvenile justice personnel to perceive affected girls as aggressive or antisocial.

In chronic cases with significant tendon defects, primary repair is often not feasible, and reconstruction with graft augmentation becomes necessary. Achilles tendon allografts are commonly used in such scenarios; however, obtaining reliable graft incorporation and stable load-sharing remains difficult in patients with large defects, poor tendon quality, or elevated mechanical demand. This report describes a novel dual-layer Achilles tendon allograft reconstruction, referred to as the Dual-Achilles Reconstruction for Chronic Quadriceps Rupture (DARC) technique. This technique is designed to maximize circumferential graft contact, restore tendon bulk, and improve load distribution in a chronic QTR with significant retraction. A 56-year-old man with a body mass index (BMI) of 42.2 presented six weeks after two mechanical falls with persistent pain, recurrent buckling, and loss of active knee extension. Examination revealed a palpable suprapatellar defect, patella baja, and complete extensor mechanism failure. Radiographs demonstrated a Caton-Deschamps index of 0.56, and magnetic resonance imaging confirmed a full-thickness QTR with approximately 8 cm of proximal retraction and a 7 mm hematoma. Because of the chronicity of the injury and poor-quality tendon tissue, primary repair was not suitable. Reconstruction was performed using two Achilles tendon allografts anchored to the medial and lateral thirds of the superior patellar pole, which were then passed through the quadriceps muscle belly. The grafts were circumferentially wrapped around the tendon stump to create an anterior-posterior dual-layer construct intended to enhance graft integration and biomechanical stability. The patient followed a structured rehabilitation protocol. The patient regained full knee extension without extensor lag, achieved 0-120° of flexion, normalized gait by 12 weeks, and returned to unrestricted activity by one year. This favorable recovery is notable given the chronic nature of the rupture, the 8 cm retraction, and the patient's high BMI, all of which typically predict poorer outcomes. This case suggests that dual-layer Achilles tendon allograft reconstruction may offer a viable and structurally robust alternative for chronic QTRs with significant tissue loss where direct repair or single-graft techniques may be insufficient.

Discrimination was determined by changing the filament length by 5-mm increments (both retraction and extension) until the subject was able to correctly and consistently distinguish less, greater, or equal sensation compared with the previous application. Threshold to pain was determined at the filament length at which the participant expressed pain or discomfort.\nRESULTS: There was no difference in threshold to sensation between blue (450 nm) and red (620 nm) light sources (P ≥ 0.99). There was no statistically significant difference in discrimination of stimuli under blue- or red-light exposure (P = 0.30), although blue-light exposure trended to be more sensitive. The threshold to pain under blue light was statistically significantly lower than in red-light conditions, with pain at a longer filament length under blue-light exposure compared with red-light exposure (median 12.5 mm vs. 7.5 mm, respectively; P = 0.03).\nCONCLUSIONS: Blue- versus red-light exposure decreases subjective corneal pain threshold when measured by the Cochet-Bonnet esthesiometer. Altered corneal sensitivity may mediate blue light-induced ocular discomfort.

Artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs) are the primary treatment modality; however, their efficacy is undermined by the prevalence of substandard ACTs and the increasing risk of resistance. Therefore, it is crucial to improve evidence on quality, therapeutic efficacy, and regulatory performance to promote malaria control efforts in the region.\nMETHODS: This systematic review followed PRISMA 2020 guidelines, with the protocol registered in PROSPERO (CRD420251135109). Literature was searched in PubMed and Google Scholar databases from July to September 2025. Methodological quality was appraised using MEDQUARG and STROBE. Two reviewers independently extracted data, resolving discrepancies by consensus. The extracted findings were synthesised narratively to identify key trends.\nRESULTS: A systematic review of 40 articles from Ethiopia, Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda revealed considerable variation in the quality of Artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs). Across the four East African countries, a total of 3363 ACT samples were tested, of which 375 failed to comply with specification limits set for at least one physicochemical quality parameter. This corresponds to an overall failure rate of 11.2% (375/3363). Country-specific failure rates reflect the highest rate in Uganda (33.3% [16/48]), followed by Kenya (14.1% [10/71]), Tanzania (11.6% [333/2859]), and Ethiopia (4.2% [16/385]). This considerable variation could be attributed to the differences in prevalence, the number of studies conducted, study design, and sampling methodology. The reported poor quality of ACTs, major treatment options in managing malaria cases, could pose a public health threat. Though the studies conducted so far may not give a real picture of the magnitude of poor quality ACTs medicines and their impact on the treatment outcomes, the reports indicated that ACTs remain highly efficacious, with most therapeutic trials reporting polymerase chain reaction-corrected cure rates of ≥ 90%. As indicated in the literature, Artemether-lumefantrine consistently demonstrated strong treatment outcomes, while dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine provided extended prophylactic effects. However, emerging Plasmodium falciparum resistance, particularly K13 mutations associated with delayed parasite clearance, poses an ongoing threat to ACT effectiveness.\nCONCLUSION: The findings of this study revealed that 11.2% of ACTs samples were found to be poor quality. The clinical data reflects that in East Africa, ACTs remain effective despite the prevalence of substandard and falsified ACTs and emerging resistance threatening long-term gains.

Purpose To investigate CT characteristics of NSNs associated with pathologic invasiveness and to develop a radiologic ternary classification model for differentiating among preinvasive lesions, minimally invasive adenocarcinoma (MIA), and invasive adenocarcinoma (IAC). Materials and Methods This retrospective study enrolled patients with pathologically confirmed lung adenocarcinoma and suspicious malignant NSNs measuring 3.0-30.0 mm on preoperative CT scans between January 2012 and June 2024. For each NSN, the size, location, margin, shape, nodule CT attenuation, uniformity of density, lobulation sign, reticulation sign, intranodular vessels, bubble-like lucency sign, air bronchogram sign, and pleural retraction sign were independently evaluated by two radiologists blinded to clinical information and pathology results.

We find that reviewers who were cited in versions after version 1 were more likely to make a favourable recommendation (odds ratio = 1.61; adjusted 99.4% CI: 1.16-2.23), whereas being cited in the first version did not improve their recommendation (odds ratio = 0.84; adjusted 99.4% CI: 0.69-1.03). For all versions of the articles, the reviewers who commented that their own articles should be cited were less likely to recommend approval compared to the reviewers who did not, with the strongest association after the first version (odds ratio = 0.15; adjusted 99.4% CI: 0.08-0.30). Reviewers who included a citation to their own articles were much more likely to approve a revised article that cited their articles compared to a revised article that did not (odds ratio = 3.5; 95% CI: 2.0-6.1). Some reviewers' recommendations depend on whether they are cited or want to be cited. Reviewer citation requests can turn peer review into a transaction rather than an objective critique of the article.", "scraped_at": "2026-01-19T00:16:49.430057+00:00"}

Meanwhile, despite advances in non-destructive and rapid hyperspectral imaging (HSI) technology, its predominant spectral-biased approach faces challenges in distinguishing chemically similar adulterants. Notably, unlike authentic meat formed through natural processes, adulterated meat undergoes artificial reconstruction, creating distinct tissue surface morphological differences.

{"pmid": "41429990", "type": "article", "source": "PubMed_US", "title": "Comparison between olfactory bulb and olfactory tract implantations through an endoscopic supraorbital keyhole approach: a cadaveric study.", "abstract": "PURPOSE: Since the COVID-19 pandemic, olfactory loss has been recognized as a highly prevalent condition that greatly impacts the quality of life. Similar to other sensory implants, the idea of an olfactory implant has emerged. Evidence indicates that electrical stimulation of specific olfactory structures can evoke smell sensations. However, debates on the most appropriate anatomical target and surgical technique for implantation are still ongoing. By extrapolating data from other surgical indications, transcranial approaches appear to carry a lower risk of cerebrospinal fluid leakage and infection compared with endoscopic endonasal routes. The aim of this study was to compare two electrode placements (dorsal olfactory bulb and ventral olfactory tract) through a supraorbital keyhole craniotomy in human cadavers.\nMETHOD: Four fresh human cadavers were dissected in a staged manner. Supraorbital keyhole craniotomy was performed through an eyebrow incision and the frontal lobe was slightly retracted to allow angled (30°) endoscope insertion.

Similar to other sensory implants, the idea of an olfactory implant has emerged. Evidence indicates that electrical stimulation of specific olfactory structures can evoke smell sensations. However, debates on the most appropriate anatomical target and surgical technique for implantation are still ongoing. By extrapolating data from other surgical indications, transcranial approaches appear to carry a lower risk of cerebrospinal fluid leakage and infection compared with endoscopic endonasal routes. The aim of this study was to compare two electrode placements (dorsal olfactory bulb and ventral olfactory tract) through a supraorbital keyhole craniotomy in human cadavers.\nMETHOD: Four fresh human cadavers were dissected in a staged manner. Supraorbital keyhole craniotomy was performed through an eyebrow incision and the frontal lobe was slightly retracted to allow angled (30°) endoscope insertion. An auditory brainstem implant (ABI) from MED-EL was used for electrode placement.\nRESULTS: Endoscopic placement of the electrode on the dorsal side of the olfactory bulb was achieved after orbital roof drilling in all cases, but was not stable. On the contrary, endoscopic placement of an electrode under the olfactory tract was easily achieved without drilling and the electrode was stable between the olfactory tract and the planum sphenoidale, behind the olfactory bulb.\nCONCLUSION: Ventral olfactory tract implantation posterior to the olfactory bulb using an ABI is straightforward and is associated with satisfactory electrode stability. Such a procedure could be used for clinical pilot studies evaluating the effects of various stimulation protocols on the olfactory tract in patients with long-lasting olfactory loss.", "scraped_at": "2026-01-19T00:16:52.287165+00:00"}

This study aims to identify anatomical regions where RT dose is related to breast side-effects using the voxel-wise image-based data mining (IBDM) technique.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: Data of 922 patients included in the REQUITE study and who underwent RT after breast-conserving surgery were analysed. All patients were treated supine. We analysed breast pain, oedema, atrophy, induration, and nipple retraction, scored before and after RT by clinicians and patients. We investigated the toxicity burden using the area under the curve for toxicity over time (ToxT-AUC) and applied IBDM by normalising all dose distributions to three reference anatomies. To do so, we established a spatial normalisation pipeline, ensuring that the ipsilateral breast was aligned (flipping all left-side treatments laterally). Dose distributions were converted to equivalent dose in 2 Gy-fraction (EQD2, α/β = 1.7 Gy and 3 Gy) to account for different RT fractionations. To determine the relevance of each identified region, we used multivariable ordinal regression, including patient-specific factors and clinical variables.\nRESULTS: Significant regions associated with each breast side-effect were found in different breast quadrants. The regions showed higher mean EQD2 than the complete breast contour, particularly for grade 2+ (p < 0.01). Dosimetric parameters extracted from the region were significant in multivariable analysis.\nCONCLUSION: We found regions within the breast where the local dose associates with breast side-effects after breast RT.
