Status: COMPLETED


Brief Summary:
The aim of this study is to evaluate the antitumor activity and potential adverse effects of the combination celecoxib plus carboplatin in patients with recurrent, heavily pre-treated Ovarian Cancer (OC). The potential changes induced by the experimental combination on angiogenesis-related serum markers and quality of life measures will be also evaluated.The main objective is to evaluate the response rate. Secondary objectives are the following:toxicity;progression free survival;overall survival;duration of response;quality of life;modulation of angiogenesis-related molecules.


Detailed Description:
This phase II prospective study will be conducted at the Gynecologic Oncology Units of the Catholic University of Rome and Campobasso, Italy. The study is non-sponsored, investigators initiated. The primary objective is to determine the tumor response rate by RECIST criteria. Secondary objectives included duration of response, progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), toxicity assessment, and QoL measures.Patients are required to take celecoxib (200 mg tablets by mouth twice daily, day 1 to 28), associated to intravenous carboplatin (area under the curve (AUC) 5 over 30 to 60 minutes, every 28 days). Patients who will develop carboplatin hypersensitivity reaction (HSR) will follow a desensitization protocol, or alternatively will switch to cisplatin. Erythropoietic stimulating agent and myeloid growth factors are not permitted for cycle 1 of study treatment, and their use will be chosen by the treating physician, according to hospital policy.Treatment will be discontinued when any of the following events occurs: radiographic or clinical evidence of cancer progression; deterioration of health or intolerable toxicity; patient refusal. Before starting treatment, patients will be evaluated by medical history, physical examination, cell blood count (CBC), chemistry panel, Ca125, and either computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging scan.

Title: Self-monitoring Activity: a Randomized Trial of Game-oriented Applications (SMARTGOAL)

Status: COMPLETED


Brief Summary:
The purpose of this study is to compare an enhanced intervention that includes narrative and game components to a standard intervention that only targets self-monitoring. These approaches will be tested among postmenopausal breast cancer survivors who are sedentary and overweight.


Detailed Description:
Habitual physical activity decreases risk of multiple negative health outcomes, including breast cancer recurrence and mortality. It is also associated with better quality of life and reducing negative effects of cancer and cancer treatment. However, most breast cancer survivors do not engage in sufficient physical activity. Behavior change interventions produce short-term increases in activity but have difficulty motivating sustained active lifestyles over longer periods and are not equally effective in women of different races/ethnicities. The purpose of this study is to test a novel intervention that uses video games and storytelling to increase motivation. Video game mechanics increase enjoyment and feelings of autonomy (control), competence, and relatedness to others. All of these feelings are associated with motivation for activity and, in turn, sustained activity over time. Additionally, narrative storytelling is an effective method of persuading individuals to change their behavior. We propose that play of active video games that include compelling storylines will increase physical activity among a diverse sample of postmenopausal breast cancer survivors.

To test this hypothesis, we will conduct a clinical trial that compares the enhanced intervention (story-based video games) to a standard intervention in 90 sedentary, overweight postmenopausal breast cancer survivors. Participants in the enhanced group will receive a mobile device and accessories with two story-based video game applications installed. The games incorporate behavior change strategies such as self-monitoring and feedback while also using game mechanics and a lengthy storyline to motivate physical activity. Participants in the standard group will receive the same mobile device with an electronic activity monitor and its companion feedback application. Both groups will receive brief weekly telephone counseling. By comparing two groups that both receive typical behavior change intervention components (counseling) and a novel electronic intervention, we will be able to investigate the specific effects of game mechanics and storytelling on motivation and physical activity. We will measure changes in physical activity, fitness, function, and quality of life from the beginning of the study to 6 months. We will also investigate further changes during an additional 6 month follow-up period in which participants keep their intervention tools but do not receive any counseling, to measure maintenance of activity."

Title: Eat Out With KP: A Pilot to Improve the Impact of Dietary Advice for Families

Status: COMPLETED


Brief Summary:
Dietary counseling at the point of purchase could improve patient adherence to dietary advice and downstream health outcomes. The aim of our pilot is to test the efficacy of a novel delivery system for dietary advice. We will study the effect of relocating family weight management counseling sessions into restaurants, where registered dieticians and patients will conduct scheduled group visits while enjoying a meal together. As with office-based visits, our goal is for members and their families to learn how to select food options based on their unique health needs, budgetary concerns, and time constraints. In contrast to a traditional counseling visit, however, co-dining with a dietitian will give members a hands-on experience designed to enhance their learning and improve adherence. The proposed study would build on an existing pilot of a similar program, the ""KP Personal Shopper"", where dietitian visits were conducted with individuals either in the clinic setting or while shopping in a grocery store.

We will compare the new ""Eat Out with Kaiser"" approach to the current standard of clinic-based dietary and lifestyle counseling for weight management among 40 families affected by obesity, with the following outcomes in mind:

1. Change in dietary measures
2. Nutritional knowledge of families
3. Participant self-efficacy and confidence in food purchasing decisions
4. Participant and dietician perception of visit

We hypothesize that, compared to clinic-based visits, our ""Eat Out with Kaiser"" visits will result in more favorable perception of the visit by both dietitian and participant, higher nutritional knowledge scores, higher self-efficacy and confidence of patients around food decisions, and larger improvements in diet components.

Title: Translating Fall Risk Status Into Interventions to Prevent Patient Falls: Falls TIPS (Tailoring Interventions for Patient Safety)

Status: COMPLETED


Brief Summary:
The goal of our project is to prevent patient falls by translating an individual patient's fall risk assessment into a decision support intervention that communicates fall risk status, and creates a tailored evidence-based plan of care that will be accessible to members of the care team to prevent falls.


Detailed Description:
Patient falls are defined as ""patients who experience an unplanned descent to the floor"". Patient falls in hospitals are a key safety issue and represent the most frequently reported adverse event in acute care settings. Previous work related to fall risk assessment suggests that a large majority of falls (78%) occur as a result of the presence of physiological risk factors such as confusion, incontinence, poor balance and mobility problems. These falls are considered preventable and as such are classified as iatrogenic.

Phase 1 Specific Aim: To describe the current barriers, facilitators, and methods of fall risk communication in acute care settings (2 academic medical center and 2 community hospital units).

1. What fall risk communication exists within the context of patient care workflow that alerts nurses and other providers (physicians, physical therapists, pharmacists) regarding patients' fall risk status?

   * What should the elements of alerts be at the point of care to support fall risk communication to nurses and other interdisciplinary team members?
   * How should the alert be communicated to professional and paraprofessional providers, patients, and families?
2. What communication of actions to prevent falls exists within the context of patient care workflow that promotes use of a fall prevention plan of care?

   * Based on empirical data to reduce barriers and enhance facilitators, how can information systems be used to create and communicate a tailored evidence-based fall risk patient safety plan of care derived from the nursing fall risk assessment?
   * Based on the C-IC conceptual model, how should the tailored evidence-based fall risk patient safety plan of care be communicated to professional and paraprofessional providers, patients, and families?

Phase 2 Specific Aim: To develop a Fall Prevention Tool Kit (FPTK) prototype that includes 1) The Fall Risk Alert and Communication Plan that translates an individual patient's fall risk assessment into an interdisciplinary fall risk status communication and 2) The Patient Safety Plan of Care (PSPOC), that translates the individual patient's fall risk assessment into a decision support intervention that creates a tailored evidence-based plan of care to be used by professional and paraprofessional providers, patients, and family members across acute care settings."

Title: Early Cognitive Assessment and Evolutionary Monitoring of Patients With Severe ARDS (Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome) on SARS-CoV2 Viral Pneumonia Requiring Mechanical Ventilation

Status: COMPLETED


Brief Summary:
The new coronavirus pandemic responsible for the severe acute respiratory syndrome SARS-CoV2 requires, in its severe forms, the use of invasive ventilation in intensive care.

The first patients seen in intensive care presented with neurological symptoms and usually not seen in non-viral ARDS or due to other viral causes. These were mainly restless awakenings, attempts at self-extubation and confusional syndromes. Although the data in the literature do not seem to reveal the presence of SARS-CoV2 in the CSF of these patients, certain elements seem to show parenchymal brain damage with the description of hypometabolism of the frontal regions. In addition, most of these patients present a memory complaint after going into intensive care (personal data not published).

We do not know to date what is the cognitive and psychic profile of these patients, nor what will be their future evolution. Some patients may require specific neuro-cognitive rehabilitation.

The aim of this study is to assess the cognitive profile of patients infected with COVID-19 who have used invasive ventilation in the intensive care unit of Paris Saint-Joseph hospital since April 2020, in order to be able to compare them between them and follow their evolution in the medium term. This work could make it possible to describe the specific cognitive impairment of SARS-CoV2, by trying to evade other causes of cognitive disorders in patients hospitalized in intensive care for respiratory distress (hypoxia, treatments, metabolic disorders, etc.).

The main objective is to follow the medium-term evolution between 3 and 6 months of the cognitive profile of patients with severe form of SARS-CoV2 with the use of ventilatory resuscitation.


Eligibility Criteria:
Inclusion Criteria:

* Patient whose age ≥ 18 years
* Patient with SARS-CoV2 treated in the intensive care unit of the HPSJ for respiratory distress, using invasive ventilation by oro-tracheal intubation from April 2020

Status: COMPLETED


Brief Summary:
The objective of the study is to assess the acceptability, feasibility, and barriers to Lucky Iron Fish™ (LIF) utilization among families with young children in a Latin American community with a high prevalence of iron deficiency and iron-deficiency anemia.

.


Detailed Description:
The primary objective is to assess the acceptability of cooking with an iron ingot (Lucky Iron Fish™) compared to traditional oral iron supplementation methods among preschool aged children in a Dominican community with a high prevalence of anemia (\> 50%). Data will be collected to characterize the natural history of iron deficiency and anemia in pre-school aged children in a Dominican community. The study will involve a randomized control trial to assess the primary objective: children \> 1 year and \< 5 years of age will be randomized into two study arms: LIF plus citrus (LIF arm) versus standard iron-supplementation (enhanced standard of care). Participants enrolled in the both study arms will have study labs drawn every 3, 6, and 12-months (hemoglobin, serum ferritin, c-reactive protein) to assess the natural history of iron deficiency in these children. Concomitant to study labs, parents/guardians will be surveyed on acceptability, compliance, and barriers to use of their assigned iron supplementation method.

Primary study outcomes are the change in hemoglobin within the LIF group and then difference in change in hemoglobin between study arms over a 12-month study period. Secondary outcomes include changes in serum ferritin within and between study arms and exploring the relationship between changes in hemoglobin, serum ferritin, and C-reactive protein

Title: Work-Health-Life-Balance 4.0 - Mental Resilience, Stability & Healthy Nutrition in a New Work Reality

Status: UNKNOWN


Brief Summary:
New working environments (digitalization, flexibilization) can lead to increased levels of stress. A balanced work-life balance is therefore important in order to prevent negative effects of stress on mental health.

This study investigates,

1. how stress, recovery, nutritional behavior, resilience and sleep behavior are related to the changed working conditions.
2. how standardized nutritional training affects individual body composition (measured using Bioelectrical Impedance Analyses, BIA), stress perception, burn-out symptoms and sleep.


Detailed Description:
The ways of working must adapt to the challenges and opportunities of the digital world. Work 4.0 describes the process of change in the working environment in the digital age. Adapting to rapidly changing and sometimes uncertain living and working conditions in times of digitization, dislocated working (including ""home office"") and altered work processes demands a considerable effort of resources from numerous employees. Previously established work environments and behaviors are being evaluated and adapted to the new circumstances and requirements.

Such times of change often cause uncertainty and result in increased stress levels. Stress, in turn, leads to a variety of symptoms in many areas of life and work, which can limit the ability to work. As a result, successful adaptation to the challenges of the new work reality of Work 4.0 can fail.

Research Questions:

This study investigates,

1. how stress, recovery, nutritional behavior, resilience and sleep behavior are related to the changed working conditions and central characteristics of work 4.0.
2. how standardized nutritional training based on the Austrian Food Pyramid affects individual body composition (measured using Bioelectrical Impedance Analyses, BIA), stress perception, burn-out symptoms and sleep.

Title: The ProChol Study - Prospective Assessment of Symptoms Following Cholecystectomy in Patients With Symptomatic Uncomplicated Gallstones

Status: RECRUITING


Brief Summary:
This prospective clinical cohort study will include patients with gallstones and abdominal pain scheduled for surgery (laparoscopic cholecystectomy). Data on quality of life, abdominal pain, gallstone disease, and patient characteristics will be collected before surgery. The outcomes will be assessed three months following surgery and will primarily be determinants for resolution of pain. The aim is to make a prediction score that may aid clinicians and patients in decision making about surgery.


Detailed Description:
Cholecystectomy is the surgical removal of the gallbladder and the only definitive treatment for both symptomatic complicated and uncomplicated gallstones. Surgery rates for laparoscopic cholecystectomy have been rapidly rising in European countries the past decades. Over 9000 cholecystectomies were performed in Denmark in 2016. Symptomatic outcomes following surgery have not been with the intended resolution of symptoms and remaining symptoms are reported in about 35% of patients. This indicates clinical challenges in selecting the patients that will benefit the most from surgery.

The quality of symptomatic outcomes following laparoscopic cholecystectomy should be assessed in a Danish population reflecting current clinical practice for selection of patients with symptomatic uncomplicated gallstones for surgery. Development of a clinical prediction tool for pain relief including both patient-reported and readily available objective variables could aid future patient selection and minimize overall health-care costs and unnecessary surgery risk in patients with symptomatic uncomplicated gallstones.

The aim is to perform a prospective assessment of the symptomatic outcomes of elective laparoscopic intended cholecystectomy in patients with symptomatic uncomplicated gallstones and to develop a prediction model for a pain-free state.

This is a prospective observational study that will be performed across the general surgical hospitals in healthcare regions of Denmark. Consecutive consenting patients will be included from each site until required sample size has reached.

Eligible patients will be identified through screening lists of outpatient clinics and of operating theaters. Patients will be approached for consent and data collection at either the outpatient clinical visit where cholecystectomy is scheduled or at a later timepoint before surgery. Follow-up for symptomatic outcome will be performed three months after surgery. Data collection at both study entry and follow-up will include access to the electronic patient record and answering an online patient questionnaire. If patient questionnaires remain unanswered after one week, the patient will be reminded through an online re-invitation."

Title: A Pivotal Trial to Establish the Efficacy and Safety of Algisyl in Patients With Moderate to Severe Heart Failure

Status: UNKNOWN


Brief Summary:
AUGMENT-HF II is a study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the Algisyl device. The purpose of this study is to investigate Algisyl employed as a method of left ventricular augmentation and restoration in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy.

Algisyl will be injected into the myocardium under direct visualization during the surgical procedure. Structural abnormalities in the heart are known to play a central role in HF, and clinical evidence supports a strong causal relationship between cardiac chamber dilation and heart failure. Because dilation, and not contractile dysfunction, appears to be responsible for the severity of the disease, the mitigation or prevention of the deleterious structural abnormalities of the left ventricle appears to be an important therapeutic target for patients with this life threatening illness.

Hence, a therapy that specifically reduces LV wall stress, targets LV dilatation and LV remodeling may offer an important new alternative in the treatment of heart failure. Algisyl is being investigated based on evidence that suggests an ability of the implants to reduce wall stress, reshape the LV chamber and reduce the LV chamber size as well as prevent the progressive ventricular dilation and remodeling associated with HF.

The physiologic response to progressive exercise using direct measures of ventilation and gas exchange via the cardiopulmonary exercise test is an important diagnostic tool in the management of the patient with HF, quantifying responses to therapy, and as a reliable prognostic utility for predicting outcomes in patients with HF.

Numerous studies have established the strong association of peak VO2 with mortality and morbidity risk in HF. Peak VO2 conceptually is considered an overall global marker of cardiopulmonary health and is a reflection of the degree of impairment in ventricular function ( the heart's pumping capacity), oxygen delivery and oxygen utilization.

Hence, employing the change in peak VO2 as a primary endpoint in this clinical study provides a strong objective measure that can be interpreted in independent blinded fashion, to evaluate the result of the therapeutic intervention and provide an equally strong assessment of the prognostic implications for patients in the study.

This clinical evaluation is intended to provide confirmatory evidence of the effectiveness and safety of the device Algisyl in patients with advanced heart failure.

Title: Metabolic Profiling of Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus in Children and Adolescents: a Case-control Study

Status: COMPLETED


Brief Summary:
The aim of this study was to look for discriminating variation in the concentrations of small-molecule metabolites in the plasma of T1DM children compared with non-diabetic matched controls using proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1H-NMR)-based metabolomics.


Detailed Description:
Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) is one of the most common pediatric diseases and its incidence is rising in many countries. Recently, it has been shown that metabolites other than glucose play an important role in insulin deficiency and the development of diabetes. The aim of this study was to look for discriminating variation in the concentrations of small-molecule metabolites in the plasma of T1DM children compared with non-diabetic matched controls using proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1H-NMR)-based metabolomics.

This cross-sectional study was set-up to examine the metabolic profile in fasting plasma samples from 7 T1DM children and 7 non-diabetic controls aged 8 to 18 years, and matched for gender, age and BMI. The obtained plasma 1H-NMR spectra were rationally divided into 110 integration regions, representing the metabolic phenotype. These integration regions reflect the relative metabolite concentrations and were used as statistical variables to construct (train) a classification model in discriminating between T1DM patients and controls.

Title: Eat My ABCs: Integrate Healthy Eating Into School Readiness

Status: COMPLETED


Brief Summary:
Evaluate the effects of the ""Eat My ABCs"" program on improving Head Start preschoolers' eating behavior and anthropometric properties (BMI, percent body fat).


Detailed Description:
The 14-week, community-led, program, aimed to establish lifelong healthy eating habits among vulnerable low-income preschoolers living in rural Michigan, includes three main components: (1) ""Eat My ABCs"" child curriculum, (2) child fruit/vegetable letters to parents, and (3) program cookbook.

""Eat My ABCs"" Child Curriculum. Head Start teachers, along with teacher assistants/aids, will independently teach the age appropriate ""Eat My ABCs"" curriculum per week, for a total of 14 weeks. The ""Eat My ABCs"" curriculum follows the alphabet theme and incorporates the five senses into learning (hear fruit and vegetable information, see the color, feel the texture, smell the scent, and taste the flavor). Each week includes two sessions: 1) healthy eating learning on one fruit and one vegetable by incorporating school readiness knowledge on numbers, shapes, colors, and alphabets; and 2) food taste-testing activities to expose children to one fruit, one vegetable, and relevant food items made from the one fruit and one vegetable to teach children the creative ways to make fruit/vegetable healthy and tasty.

Child Letter to Parents. Every week, each child will create one letter, using stickers, regarding the one fruit and one vegetable presented in the program that he/she tasted or wanted to try at home.

Program Cookbook. The investigators have developed a targeted program cookbook for low-income families to overcome their limited cooking skills, busy schedules, and tight family budget. The program cookbook contains all budget-friendly recipes for healthy breakfasts, family meals, quick-fixes, kid-friendly snacks, and occasional sweets; and these recipes are culturally appropriate with a variety of choices such as American, Italian, Mexican, and Asian cuisines. In the cookbook, the investigators also promote slow /pressure-cooking recipes as using a slow or pressure cooker to prepare easy but healthy meals is an effective way to overcome low-income parent barriers of lack of time and cooking skills. In addition, the cookbook contains creative ways of making fruit/vegetable healthy, tasty, and kid-friendly at home.

Title: A Pragmatic, Randomised, Controlled, Trial of the Effect of the Counterweight Plus Weight Management Programme in Uncontrolled Asthma Associated With Elevated Body Mass Index

Status: UNKNOWN


Brief Summary:
Weight loss for uncontrolled asthma associated with elevated BMI. Asthma is a common condition with different types recognised that have variable responses to current treatments. It is often poorly controlled and there is a need to discover new treatments. Obesity is common in asthma and is associated with increase in symptoms, poorer asthma control and quality of life, and increased healthcare utilisation and treatment burden. The Counterweight Plus programme is a safe, evidence-based non-surgical intervention that is associated with sustained weight losses of up to 15% in obese individuals but its effects in asthma have not been tested. Our study aims to evaluate the impact of this intervention in individuals with difficult asthma associated with obesity.

The Counterweight Plus programme includes a total diet replacement (TDR) phase (12 weeks) followed by structured food reintroduction (6 weeks) and long term weight loss maintenance (34 weeks) and will be provided by Dieticians trained in the delivery of this intervention. Participants will attend fortnightly clinic reviews with Dieticians during the first 18 weeks and then monthly clinic reviews during the weight loss maintenance period.

Participants will be randomised to Counterweight Plus programme or usual care (control) and followed for 1 year with study visits at baseline, 4 months and 1 year. During study visits participants will be invited to complete questionnaires, provide a blood sample, perform breathing tests and a walking test, and wear an activity monitor for one week.

If the Counterweight Plus programme is proven to be of benefit in this patient group, this may lead to service development so that this intervention may be made available to similar patients in the future within the clinical setting.


Detailed Description:
This study will be a unblinded, pragmatic, pilot, randomised, controlled trial of the Counterweight Plus programme versus usual care in individuals with difficult asthma associated with obesity. Eligible individuals will be identified through Difficult Asthma Clinics or ward admissions. Those wishing to participate will receive an information sheet and be invited to provide written informed consent prior to commencing the study."

Title: A Comparison of High-dose Dual Therapy and Half-dose Clarithromycin-containing Bismuth Quadruple Therapy for H.P Eradication in Elderly Patients

Status: UNKNOWN


Brief Summary:
The purpose of this study is to assess and compare the effectiveness and safety of high-dose dual therapy and half-dose clarithromycin-containing bismuth quadruple therapy in elderly patients for eradicating H.pylori.


Detailed Description:
Helicobacter pylori plays an important role in many diseases such as peptic ulcer disease and MALT lymphomas. And the prevalence of H. pylori remains high in developing countries,including China.

Clarithromycin-containing bismuth quadruple therapy has been recommended as the first-line therapy for H pylori infection in China. However, its expensive cost and high antibiotic-related adverse reactions are always haunting us. In 2018,a research from NanFang hospital(China）revealed that 250mg clarithromycin is as effective as 500mg clarithromycin，at the same time，causes less adverse reactions. On the othe hand,previous studies reported a new regimen called large dose dual therapy（generally contains a PPI and amoxicillin),while some of them have achieved very good results,especially in Taiwan.

However, specific data on anti-H.pylori treatments in elderly people are very lacking.So,we aim to assess and compare the effectiveness and tolerability of high-dose dual therapy and half-dose clarithromycin-containing bismuth quadruple therapy in elderly patients.Considering the difference of drug metabolism between eldery and young people，a satisfactory result may be obtained.


Eligibility Criteria:
Inclusion Criteria:

* Patients, aged greater than 65 , with positive H. pylori infection that was not eradicated by previous therapies are included. The H. pylori infection is confirmed by the positive rapid urease test or 13C-breath test.

Exclusion Criteria:

* Patients with significant underlying disease including liver, cardiac, pulmonary, and renal diseases, neoplasia, coagulopathy and genetic diseases, history of gastric surgery, pregnancy, breast-feeding, active gastrointestinal bleeding, the use of PPI, NSAID or antibiotics during the 4 weeks prior to enrolment, and previous history of allergic reactions to any of the medications used in this protocol. Patients previously treated with H. pylori eradication regimens or those unwilling to participate in the study were also excluded.

Title: Development of a Mobile APP to Promote Physical Activity in Individuals with Knee Osteoarthritis: a ""Move for Knee"" Study Protocol

Status: NOT_YET_RECRUITING


Brief Summary:
The goal of this clinical trial is to evaluate the effectiveness of an app developed to provide useful guidance on physical activity for people with knee osteoarthritis.The main question it aims to answer is:

""What physical activity can I perform with knee osteoarthritis?"" Researchers will compare use of app developed to provide physicial activity program versus educational advices (a look-alike substance that contains no drug) to see if APP works to treat pain and stiffness related to knee osteoarthritis.

Participants will:

Download and use APP Visit the clinic once every 4 weeks for checkups and tests


Detailed Description:
In this no-profit, interventional, double-arm, monocentric study, men and women with unilateral or bilateral tibiofemoral KOA according to the American College of Rheumatology criteria for KOA, aged 45 to 70 years, and radiographic findings (Kellgren-Lawrence grade 1-3) referring to the Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Unit, University of Campania ""Luigi Vanvitelli"", will be included. In this trial, the patients will be randomized into two groups:

* patients who will use the ""Move for Knee"" APP (intervention arm);
* patients who will be advised to engage in free physical activity (control arm). Patients will be directed to one of the arms through random sampling with consecutive 1:1 randomization (intervention:control).

The mobile APP called Move Your Knee is divided in 4 sections:

1. Know Your Knee: this first section allows the collection of data entered by patients, useful for understanding their lifestyle habits and daily physical activity level, and information relating to KOA pathology.

   At the end of the questionnaire, the algorithm integrated into the APP's computer code will allow the calculation of the patient's presumed level of physical activity. This will then be followed by the assignment of a specific form which includes the exercises and the related execution parameters (i.e. weekly frequency), and useful advice for safely carrying out the exercises to achieve the specific functional objectives.
2. Move Your Knee: in this section, the patient will be able to select the level of difficulty/intensity in performing the physical exercise (the more advanced levels are blocked until the previous objective is achieved).

   There are 5 levels, each marked by an evocative image that summarizes the functional meaning and, therefore, facilitates the identification of the type of user (in particular, from the most advanced level: ""Hawk""; ""Tiger""; ""Bull"", ""Turtle"", ""Sloth"").

   Once the exercise program has been started, the patient finds the indications/advice for carrying out each exercise (duration, series and repetitions)."

Brief Summary:
Skin cancers are the most common of all cancers. Their incidence has increased sharply over the decades.This increase in incidence partly reflects an aging population and behavioral patterns such as repeated exposure to the sun. Indeed, exposure to UV rays is the predominant factor involved in the pathogenesis of these tumors, hence the fact that they mainly develop in photo-exposed regions such as the cephalic extremity.

The objective of this study is to provide an epidemiological analysis of tumors in the populations of both CHU Brugmann and St Pierre hospitals.

Title: Impact of Quetiapine Prolong and Escitalopram on the Hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical (HPA)-Axis Activity in Depressed Patients

Status: COMPLETED


Brief Summary:
In former studies of the investigators research group the investigators could also demonstrate acute inhibitory effects of the antidepressant mirtazapine on ACTH and cortisol release in normal controls (Schüle et al. 2002), most likely mediated via antagonism at central 5-HT2- and H1-receptors. In contrast to mirtazapine, serotonin or norepinephrine reuptake inhibiting antidepressants acutely stimulate ACTH and cortisol secretion (Schüle 2007). The investigators also performed a study in depressed patients who were treated either with mirtazapine or with reboxetine using serial dexamethasone/CRH tests (week 0, 1, and 5) as a parameter for HPA axis activity. Mirtazapine, but not the norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor reboxetine was able to significantly reduce HPA axis activity already within one week (Schüle et al. 2006). Mirtazapine is known to have an earlier onset of antidepressant action than do SSRIs such as sertraline (Behnke et al. 2003) or antidepressants with dual mechanism of action such as venlafaxine (Benkert et al. 2006), possibly due to its rapid inhibition of HPA axis activity in unipolar depressed patients.

Since mirtazapine and quetiapine have similar effects on the HPA system in healthy male volunteers (i.e. inhibition of ACTH and cortisol secretion), a rapid attenuation of HPA axis activity is also expected during quetiapine XR treatment in depressed patients.

Therefore, in the present study the investigators goal is to investigate whether quetiapine fumarate XR at a dosage of 300 mg per day has an impact on HPA axis activity in unipolar depressed patients, as measured by serial dexamethasone/CRH tests (week 0, 1, and 5) and salivary cortisol profiles and whether putative effects of quetiapine XR on the HPA system are related to its antidepressant efficacy.

Title: Comparison of Standard Venous Sampling for Measurement of Tacrolimus and Creatinine Versus Fingerprick Mitra® Volumetric Absorptive Microsampling in Adult Renal Transplant Recipients

Status: UNKNOWN


Brief Summary:
Patients with kidney transplant have blood tests very often. This is normally done in hospital and using a needle inserted into the vein. Two tests are important for kidney transplant patients - creatinine to monitor the health of the kidney; and tacrolimus to measure the level of the medicine which prevents rejection. The investigators would like to compare a fingerprick microsampling method to the standard venous blood. The fingerprick test is the same done by patients with diabetes and we use a microsampling tip which looks like a cotton bud to draw up a small amount of blood. Each tip draws up exactly 10 microlitres which is two drops. The investigators want to compare the results of creatinine and tacrolimus done through the two methods. In the future, this would allow patients to do their creatinine and tacrolimus test at home. The tips dry completely and can be posted to a laboratory. We hope this will make life easier for transplant patients and also help them engage more with the care of their condition.

Title: Comparison of Insulin Degludec With Insulin Glargine U100 for Adults With Type 1 Diabetes Travelling Across Multiple Time Zones. A Pilot Study.

Status: COMPLETED


Brief Summary:
The purpose of the proposed study is to compare insulin Degludec \[TRESIBA® (insulin degludec injection)\] with insulin Glargine U100 \[Lantus® (insulin glargine injection)\] to determine the basal insulin of choice for adults with type 1 diabetes (T1D) who fly non-stop across multiple time zones. With the introduction of Degludec as basal insulin for T1D and the opportunity to vary time of injection between 8 and 40 hours, the use of Degludec as a basal insulin may make it easier for both people living with T1D and diabetologists to plan long-haul travel compared to the use of existing basal insulins when crossing multiple time zones.The study hypothesis is that once daily Degludec as the basal insulin will provide better glycemic control for people with type 1 diabetes on multiple daily injections who are traveling non-stop across multiple time zones than once daily Glargine U100.


Detailed Description:
This study will be an open-label, single center, pilot study. Participants will be randomized to either Glargine U100 or Degludec as the basal insulin, then a 2 week break, and followed by a cross-over to the other insulin. Each study period will begin in Honolulu, Hawaii (HI) (airport code HNL) with a non-stop flight to Newark, New Jersey (NJ) (EWR) lasting approximately 10 hours with a 6 hour time difference between destinations. After up to 72 hours in EWR, participants will return to Honolulu and spend up to 72 hours at that destination. Investigators plan to recruit 25 adults with established T1D currently being treated with multiple daily injections of insulin (MDI).


Eligibility Criteria:
Inclusion Criteria:

1. Males or females ≥18 and ≤65 years of age.
2. Type 1 diabetes mellitus (diagnosed clinically and treated with multiple daily injections of insulin) for ≥12 months.
3. HbA1c \<10% within 30 days of being enrolled in the study
4. Current treatment with any basal insulin analogue as the once daily basal insulin given in the evening (22) and no fewer than three injections with rapid acting bolus insulin (e.g. insulin aspart, insulin lispro, or insulin glulisine) as mealtime bolus insulin therapy.

The most important cause of mortality and morbidity with the geriatric population is loss of balance and the consequent falls, which is seen very often. The goal of our study is to examine the effects of plantar sensation education-based exercises on balance and falls.Materials and methods: 16 healthy, voluntary nursing home residents with the average age 77.50±5.5. Individuals had plantar sensory exercises 40 min sessions for 3 days/week during eight weeks. The study was planned as a self-controlled prospective study. Functional balance was evaluated using Berg Balance Scale, dynamic balance was evaluated using 30 Second Chair Stand Test, static balance and fall risk were assessed using Biodex Balance System.


Detailed Description:
The study was run in Istanbul Provincial Directorate of Social Services Istanbul Prof. Dr. Fahrettin Kerim-Nilüfer Gökay Nursing Home Elderly Care and Rehabilitation Center in March-June 2019. This study was designed as a self-controlled prospective non-randomized study.

Written informed consent was obtained from all participants. The necessary ethical approval for the study was taken from the Medipol University Non-Interventional Clinical Research Ethics Comittee This study was planned to be run with 20 healthy nursing home residents. The criteria of being included in the study were: being above 70 years of age, scoring at least 22 points on the Mini Mental Test, not being bound to a wheelchair, being able to walk 20 meters independently, and that the sensation of the foot sole is at least on the decreased protective level compare to Semmes Weinstein Monofilamnet test. The individuals with serious loss of eyesight, mental retardation, a schizophrenic background, having walking disorder, inconvenient in walking were not included in the study.

16 healthy aged individuals with the average age of 77.50±5.5 participated in our study. 2 of the first 20 participants left the study due to health problems and 2 other participants left due to personal reasons which they did not want to declare (Figure 1).

A homogeneous control group could not be created due to aging, so a control group was created with the same participants. The first evaluations of our study were made within two days. After the evaluation process, 4 weeks waiting period was given. At the end of this period, second measurements were made for two days. Plantar sensory based exercises program lasting 8 weeks was applied after the second measurements were taken. Post-treatment measurements were made for two days after the treatment ended. Measurements were made with MC and the physiotherapist working in the nursing home."

Title: A Novel Training Method to Reduce Fall Risk in People with Parkinson's Disease: the Role of the Balance Organ

Status: COMPLETED


Brief Summary:
Falls during walking are common in people with Parkinson's Disease (PD). Fall risk can be attributed in part to the loss of automaticity in walking and an increased reliance on sensory cues, such as the input from the balance organ. In this project the investigators want to assess the effectiveness of rehabilitation training aiming to improve this vestibular input. The effects of a visual perturbation training in a virtual reality environment will be compared to conventional treadmill training.


Detailed Description:
Fifty participants (50-65 years) with idiopathic PD (Hoehn \& Yahr scale 2-3) will be randomly assigned to the intervention group receiving four weeks of VPT in a VR environment using the Gait Real-time Analysis Interactive Lab system (GRAIL) or a control group receiving four weeks of regular treadmill training. Primary outcome measures are spatio-temporal outcome parameters of gait and dynamic stability (gait speed, stride time/length, cadence, step-to-step variability, step width variability and trunk sway), and self-reported falls, and will be recorded at all testing phases (pre-test, after baseline, after intervention and after detraining). Secondary outcome measures will include assessments of central and peripheral vestibular function (Cervical and ocular Vestibular Evoked Myogenic Potentials) for correlation with the primary outcome measures. The secondary outcomes will be recorded at pre-testing and directly after the intervention phase.


Eligibility Criteria:
Inclusion Criteria:

* Idiopathic Parkinson's disease
* Aged between 50-65 years

Title: The Safety and Tolerability of Intravitreal Adalimumab in Patients With Refractory Diabetic Macular Retinopathy or Choroidal Neovascularization or Uveitis: A Pilot Study

Status: UNKNOWN


Brief Summary:
Direct intravitreal administration of medication is the preferred method of treatment for uveitis and retinal vascular disorders. The eye is a self contained organ relatively isolated from the systemic circulation by the tight blood retinal barrier. Effective intraocular drug levels can be achieved with a much smaller amount of medication if injected intravitreally and this also results in minimal systemic exposure to the patient. Preliminary studies have shown that adalimumab may have a positive role in the management of uveitis in humans and can be an effective treatment intravitreally in animal models. No data has been published yet on intravitreal use of adalimumab in human subjects.


Detailed Description:
Abstract Purpose: Our aim is study to determine the efficacy and safety of intravitreal adalimumab in patients with active vision threatening uveitis, diabetic macular edema (DME) and choroidal neovascularization (CNV) despite standard treatment and to ensure its safety in intravitreal use in humans and its rapid onset of action.

Design: Pilot study, Non-Randomized, Open Label, Single Group Assignment, Safety Study.

Participants: 15 eyes with refractory CNV, DME, or uveitis will be injected with intravitreal adalimumab on a 3 week interval. Patients will satisfy the inclusion and exclusion criteria listed at the end.

Methods: Initial treatment will consist of intravitreal adalimumab injection (1.5 mg/ 0.03 mL) in the eyes of patients with refractory CNV, DME, or uveitis and with visual acuity less than or equal to 20/70. Patients will be followed up every 3 weeks for a total of 6 weeks. Patients will have a baseline best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), slit lamp examination, dilated fundus examination, ocular coherence tomography (OCT), fluorescein angiography (F.A), and standard electroretinogram (ERG) and then these studies will be repeated every visit. If there is stabilization or improvement in visual acuity, decrease in edema on OCT and leakage on F.A after the first injection, then further injections will be given. The injection will be delayed if a patient develops an acute systemic infection and will be given when it subsides. If there is worsening of visual acuity after the first injection, patients will be shifted to the traditional treatment with intravitreal Avastin or intravitreal steroids. The paired sample Student t- test, Chi-square test, Pearson correlation and ANOVA will be used to analyze the mean visual acuity and central retinal thickness before and after treatment."

Title: Army-Suicide Prevention Research on Implementation in the National Guard (Army-SPRING)

Status: RECRUITING


Brief Summary:
Every unit in the Connecticut Army National Guard has a Suicide Intervention Officer to provide suicide intervention education awareness for their unit, monitor for soldiers in crisis and connect soldiers with helping resources and agencies. Suicide Intervention Officers need support in this difficult role, yet there is limited guidance on how to help them. This study will shed light on how to support Suicide Intervention Officers and whether this support results in reduced suicide risk in their units.


Detailed Description:
Attachment 4: Lay Abstract Objective 1: The first objective is to spend 6 months collecting feedback from Army National Guard Soldiers and their family, the religious affairs team, and leadership on how best to reduce risk for suicide. We will also collect feedback from Suicide Intervention Officers, who are appointed to reduce risk for suicide in their unit, about how to support these officers in their important work.

Objective 2: The second objective is to compare two strategies to support Suicide Intervention Officers as they work closely with soldiers to reduce their risk for suicide. The 47 Suicide Intervention Officers in the Connecticut Army National Guard will be randomly assigned (like the flip of a coin) to one of two groups. The first group will attend an extra training (Control Group). The second group will become part of a community focused on reducing suicide risk, including access to online forums to support them in their work, support in leading Battle Drills focused on suicide prevention, and additional training and consultation (Army-SPRING Group). Chaplains/religious affairs specialists will also receive the Army-SPRING group training, but will not be randomized since there are only 5 total Chaplains and 5 religious affairs specialists.

Objective 3: The third objective is to study whether soldiers with Suicide Intervention Officers in the Army-SPRING Group (described in objective 2) report lower rates of suicide ideation and attempts than the Control Group.

Rationale: Every unit in the Connecticut Army National Guard has a Suicide Intervention Officer to provide suicide intervention education awareness for their unit, monitor for soldiers in crisis and connect soldiers with helping resources and agencies. Suicide Intervention Officers need support in this difficult role, yet there is limited guidance on how to help them. This study will shed light on how to support Suicide Intervention Officers and whether this support results in reduced suicide risk in their units."

Title: Social Media as an Information, Education and Communication Tool for Rabies Prevention: An Interventional Study

Status: COMPLETED


Brief Summary:
Background: Rabies is a fatal disease that can be avoided by treating animal bites promptly. Hence, post-exposure prophylaxis is critical. As a result, the National Rabies Control Program was approved under the 12th five-year plan in India. One of its strategies is to engage in Information, Education and Communication activities. Social media provides an opportunity for the quick and easy dissemination of research but is constrained by a lack of peer review and the risk of misinterpretation. The efficacy of a novel social media-based knowledge dissemination strategy for rabies prevention was tested in this study.

Methods: An experimental study design was followed, wherein 144 preclinical medical students of Maulana Azad Medical College, Delhi, India were included in each control and test group. The test group was administered the intervention, which exposed the participants to health education material via social media across a span of 30 days.

Title: Reducing Duration of Untreated Psychosis Through Early Detection in a Large Jail System - Surveys of Correction Officers

Status: COMPLETED


Brief Summary:
The investigators will implement a multifaceted Target Education Campaign (TEC) within the three jails about recognizing early psychotic symptoms and referring to the Correctional Health Services. This campaign will include print materials and targeted trainings for Correction Officers. To develop all aspects of the TEC, the investigators will convene a workgroup, meeting biweekly for the first 6 months, including the entire investigative team, as well as experts at the Center for Practice Innovations (CPI). Depending on the nature of agreed-upon educational materials, the investigators will use specific areas of expertise at CPI for development. Materials will provide specific, actionable, and persuasive messaging about: (1) how to identify select signs of psychosis, (2) how to refer to the Specialized Early Engagement Support Service (SEESS) (in year 2), and (3) the effectiveness of early treatment through coordinated specialty care for early psychosis. Messaging will be continuous in the three jails.


Detailed Description:
Because Correction Officers in the three jails of interest are critically positioned to influence pathways to care, print materials will be supplemented with professional outreach and education by the SEESS. Roll-call is the approved venue by which all ongoing education happens for Correction Officers. Roll-calls take place at the beginning of each shift (7am, 3pm, 11pm) every day of the week in the same location and last \~ 15 - 20 minutes; all staff starting that shift attend. During roll-call, brief messages (2-3 minutes) will be delivered by the Controlling Captains, which is the standard practice for communicating important information to Correction Officers. Both daytime and overnight shifts will receive the targeted training for the 24 months of the TEC.

The investigators will collect pre-TEC (baseline) and during-TEC (at 6 months and 12 months) data from Correction Officers through brief surveys, which will be used to test changes in mean scores for knowledge, behavioral expectations, and self-efficacy, which are three key constructs from Social Cognitive Theory.

Title: Screening and Early Warning of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease Combined With Sleep Respiratory Disease Based on Medical Internet of Things

Status: UNKNOWN


Brief Summary:
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a common disease that endangers people's health, causing severe economic and treatment burdens. Sleep breathing disease, as a complication of COPD, increases the hospitalization rate and mortality of COPD. At present, community doctors have insufficient knowledge of COPD and its complications, and they also lack standardized screening and related disease management capabilities. This trail intends to use IoT medical technology to screen for COPD combined with sleep breathing diseases. It can establish a two-way referral channel between primary community hospitals and higher-level hospitals, which provides early warning services for COPD combined with sleep breathing diseases. This trial explores the impact of sleep breathing disease on COPD's acute exacerbation, which improves the understanding of COPD patients combined with sleep breathing diseases. It also improves COPD management and its complications control at the community-level and reduces COPD patients' potential risks and treatment burdens. It also explores tiered diagnosis and treatment models for COPD, promotes the construction of intelligent IoT infrastructure, and enhances standardized diagnosis and treatment of COPD at the grassroots level in China.


Detailed Description:
This study is a multi-center joint study, which mainly consists of two parts. First, a cross-sectional observational study was adopted to recruit patients with stable COPD in multiple centers. The COPD's diagnostic criteria follow diagnostic guidelines in China, and the patients were selected among 40-80 years old. Note that we excluded patients who cannot use IoT's mobile applications and cannot complete sleep monitoring and follow-up visits. All patients collect sleep monitoring information through wearable devices, together with demographic characteristics, pulmonary function tests, blood routines, biochemistry, electrocardiogram, chest radiograph, COPD assessment scale, modified British Medical Research Association dyspnea index, St. George's Quality of Life Questionnaire, Sleep Apnea Clinical Score, Berlin Questionnaire, Epworth Sleepiness Scale, Etc. This study estimates patient health status from the collected information, then diagnoses sleep apnea and calculates sleep apnea prevalence. Specifically, we build standards from the analysis of sleep monitoring information, and we form an OSA screening model by applying machine learning algorithms. Second, we establish a COPD cohort joined with sleep breathing disease, where we select COPD patients meeting the diagnostic criteria for sleep breathing disease. All patients use wearable devices and IoT technology for information collection and data management."

Title: A Double-Blind, Randomized, Placebo-Controlled, Ascending Single-Dose, Phase I Trial of the Anti-Orthopoxvirus Compound SIGA-246 in Healthy Volunteers

Status: WITHDRAWN


Brief Summary:
This study will test an experimental antiviral drug called SIGA-246 for use against the smallpox virus (variola). Although smallpox has been universally eradicated, it could possibly be brought back as a bioweapon. In the event of a smallpox attack, it would be best to have an antiviral medication in addition to the smallpox vaccine. SIGA-246 has shown to have activity against other viruses from the same family (orthopoxvirus) that smallpox belongs to.

Healthy volunteers who are 18-50 years of age and are not pregnant or breastfeeding may be eligible for this study. Candidates are screened with a medical history and physical examination, blood and urine tests, and an electrocardiogram.

Participants are randomly assigned to receive a one-time dose of SIGA-246 (either 500 mg, 1000 mg, or 2000 mg) or a placebo (sugar pill) taken by mouth. They report to the clinic in the morning for the following procedures:

* Insertion of intravenous (IV) line in the forearm.
* Blood and urine tests before taking the study drug.
* Drug administration within 30 minutes of eating a light breakfast.
* Blood sampling from the IV line at 30 minutes and at 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 5 and 6, 10 and 12 hours after taking SIGA-246 to determine how the drug is absorbed, distributed, broken down and excreted. Samples are also collected by needle stick at 24 and 48 hours for the same tests.
* Electrocardiogram at 2 hours and 24 hours after taking SIGA-246.
* 24-hour urine collection after taking the SIGA-246.
* Complete diary card at home for 7 days after taking the SIGA-246.
* Follow-up visits at about 2 weeks and about 4 weeks after taking SIGA-246.
* Checks for health changes or problems at every visit.


Detailed Description:
Historically, smallpox has been responsible for hundreds of millions of deaths. In 1980 the World Health Organization declared the global eradication of smallpox which was achieved through a surveillance and vaccination program using live virus vaccine. In spite of its eradication, the deliberate use of smallpox as a bioterrorist agent remains a threat. While there is an effective vaccine, there have been concerns regarding vaccine complications which have prevented universal vaccination in the absence of disease exposure. In addition, in the event of a smallpox outbreak vaccination may be ineffective in immunocompromised individuals and in those who were exposed to the virus more than 3 days prior to vaccination. Antiviral therapy may be able to supplement a vaccine, however, there are limitations of the currently available drug options. SIGA-246 is an oral medication that has been shown to be highly active against variola virus and has demonstrated safety in animal models."

Title: Phase II Study of Pidilizumab (MDV9300) in Patients With Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma Following First Remission

Status: TERMINATED


Brief Summary:
The purpose of this study is to evaluate pidilizumab and its effect, bad and/or good, on the immune system in relation to its ability to fight cancer cells. Many cancers can be brought to a phase called complete remission (no cancer is found) but have a chance that they may come back. Researchers are working to improve therapy and to find new drugs that lower the chance of disease coming back. This study uses a drug called pidilizumab. The drug targets our immune system. It can change how our immune system finds cancer cells. The drug may kill any remaining cancer cells that we cannot see with computed tomography (CT) scans. The drug, pidilizumab, is being studied in other cancers.


Detailed Description:
PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

I. To estimate the rate of response, whereby either cluster of differentiation (CD)4+CD25+programmed death 1 ligand 1 (PD-L1)+ T lymphocytes or CD4+CD62L+CD127+ T lymphocytes has an ""increase"" following administration of pidilizumab in patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) that have completed induction chemotherapy.

SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

I. To determine the toxicity and tolerability of pidilizumab therapy following induction chemotherapy.

II. To estimate the progression free survival (PFS) at 2 years. III. To estimate the overall survival (OS) at 2 years. IV. To estimate time to second line chemotherapy (TSLC) at 2 years.

TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

I. To characterize programmed death 1 (PD-1) pathway specific expression markers from the diagnostic biopsy specimens.

II. To characterize serum biomarkers of immune and inflammatory response during treatment with pidilizumab.

III. To characterize levels of soluble PD-L1 related to treatment with pidilizumab.

OUTLINE:

Patients receive pidilizumab intravenously (IV) over approximately 5 hours on day 1. Treatment repeats every 42 days for 3 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

Title: The Accuracy of Pleth Variability Index for Directed Fluid Optimization in Donors in Living Donor Liver Transplantation

Status: UNKNOWN


Brief Summary:
In this Study we are trying to validate the accuracy of Plethogram variability index in predicting fluid responsiveness compared to pulse pressure variation in donors of liver transplantation


Detailed Description:
The liver transplantation program at Ain Shams University Hospitals relies on related living donors. Extra care during anesthetic management of the donor is warranted because of clear ethical considerations.

This prospective observational study was performed after obtaining approval from the ethical committee of the Ain Shams University FWA R 53/2018. Sample of 40 healthy ASA I or II donors' candidate for right lobe hepatectomy for living donor liver transplantation (LDLT) were included and consent was taken. Conventional form of anesthesia was induced with left radial arterial line inserted for invasive blood pressure monitoring, frequent blood gases and lactate sampling, and measuring the PPV, Right insertion of internal jugular vein line for CVP measurement. Fluid management in the form of ringer acetate 3-5 ml/kg/hr recruitment of the patients (Hypovolemic donors) depends on the presenting signs that led the anesthesiologist to decide if the patient's volume status was hypovolemic and in need for fluid replacement without presence of surgical mechanical compression on the IVC or Liver during dissection phase. These diagnostic criteria for volume assessment were heart rate (HR) more than 100 beats/min, systolic arterial blood pressure (SAP) less than 90 mmHg.

Assessment of Hemodynamics during periods of Hypovolemia After exclusion of any surgical mechanical compression, all enrolled hypovolemic patients had left radial arterial line measuring PPV using Drager Monitor and a pulse oximeter measuring PVI using Device Masimo. This device measures the perfusion index which is the indicator of the amplitude of the signal of PVI, confirmation of the wave signal should be obtained from any finger, fingers should be kept warm before test is done. Hypovolemic patients were given a fluid bolus in the form of ringer acetate 5 ml / Kg over 10 minutes. At the end of volume expansion another recorded PPV and PVI are done. Primary outcome was the correlation between PPV and PVI before and after fluid resuscitation

Title: Randomized, Open, Prospective, Multicenter Pilot Study to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of Activated Recombinant Factor VII in Acute Intracerebral Haemorrhage in Patients Treated With Oral Anticoagulants or Antiplatelets Agents.

Status: UNKNOWN


Brief Summary:
Evaluation of efficacy and safety of recombinant factor VIIa versus standard therapy in preventing early haematoma growth in spontaneous acute intracerebral haemorrhage in patients treated with oral anticoagulants or antiplatelets agents


Detailed Description:
Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is the deadliest, most disabling, and least treatable form of stroke. Approximately 40% of patients die within 1 month of ICH onset, and two-thirds of survivors never regain functional independence. Though guidelines for supportive care exist, there is currently no treatment that has been shown in a randomized-controlled trial to definitely improve outcome after ICH. Hematoma volume is a critical determinant of mortality and functional outcome after ICH, and early hematoma growth may be an important cause of early neurological deterioration.

Considerable clinical interest has been given to the relationship between antiplatelet and antithrombotic treatment and ICH.

The reported incidence of major bleeding events in patients undergoing antithrombotic treatment is 5-11/1,000 patients/year, while the overall range of hemorrhages is about 62/1,000 patients/year.In the patients treated with antithrombotic drugs (oral anticoagulants or antiplatelets agent) the incidence rate of ICH has been shown higher than in the general population. Moreover, the mortality rate for both spontaneous and post-traumatic events is higher in antithrombotic treated patients than in controls. \[14,15\] rFVIIa has been successfully used to control ICH in patients with hemophilia or other coagulation disorders, and can arrest intraoperative bleeding and reverse coagulopathies in patients undergoing neurosurgical procedures.\[19\] rFVIIa has also been reported to prevent or minimize refractory bleeding in non-coagulopathic patients.


Eligibility Criteria:
Inclusion Criteria:

* ICH in patient on treatment with one of the following:
* a)oral anticoagulant (INR upper than 1,4 at enrollment
* b) aspirin, whatever dosage
* Male or female subjects, age \> 18 years.

Title: Impact of Comorbiditries and Disease Severity on Clinical Outcomes of Patients With Acute Exacerbations of Bronchiectesis

Status: NOT_YET_RECRUITING


Brief Summary:
Acute exacerbations of bronchiectasis are associated with variable outcomes depending on patient factors. Comorbidities such as COPD, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease, as well as disease severity scores, significantly influence hospitalization rates, length of stay, need for intensive care, and mortality. Understanding these associations helps in risk stratification, guiding management, and improving prognosis in affected patients.


Detailed Description:
Bronchiectasis is a chronic respiratory condition characterized by permanent and abnormal dilatation of the bronchi, often associated with recurrent infections, impaired mucociliary clearance, and progressive lung damage. Acute exacerbations represent a major clinical problem, contributing to significant morbidity, reduced quality of life, and increased healthcare burden.

The clinical outcomes of patients experiencing acute exacerbations of bronchiectasis are not uniform, and multiple factors influence their prognosis. Among these, comorbidities and disease severity play crucial roles. Comorbidities such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), asthma, cardiovascular diseases, diabetes mellitus, and chronic renal impairment can increase susceptibility to exacerbations and worsen their clinical course. The presence of these comorbid conditions is often linked to prolonged hospital stays, higher rates of intensive care admission, frequent readmissions, and increased mortality.

Similarly, the severity of underlying bronchiectasis, often assessed through validated scoring systems (e.g., Bronchiectasis Severity Index \[BSI\], FACED score), is strongly correlated with outcomes during exacerbations. Patients with more severe disease tend to experience more frequent and severe exacerbations, impaired lung function, greater need for intravenous antibiotics, and higher risk of complications.

Therefore, assessing both comorbidity burden and disease severity is critical in predicting outcomes, guiding clinical decision-making, and tailoring individualized management strategies for patients presenting with acute exacerbations of bronchiectasis. A comprehensive understanding of these relationships will aid in early risk stratification, optimization of treatment, and potentially reduction of adverse outcomes in this vulnerable patient population.


Eligibility Criteria:
Inclusion Criteria:

* Adults (≥18 years) admitted with a diagnosis of ""Bronchiectasis with acute exacerbation""."

Title: Distribution of Coronal Plane Alignment of the Knee Classification in Chinese Osteoarthritic as Well as Healthy Population

Status: UNKNOWN


Brief Summary:
coronal plane alignment of the knee(CPAK) distribution of 246 cases(477 knees) of OA patients and 107 cases(214 knees) of healthy people were examined on long-leg radiographs retrospectively. Radiological measurements and CPAK classification on different Kellgren- Lawrence(K-L) Grade in patients with unilateral total knee arthroplasty(TKA) were compared. Clinical outcomes of CPAK type I patients performed by mechanical alignment(MA) and restricted kinematic alignment(rKA) during TKA were examined. ML algorithm including K nearest neighbors (KNN), random forest(RF), artificial neural networks (ANN), logistic regression(LR) and gradient boosting (GBDT) were established, the dependent variable was set as whether the constitutional phenotype of an arthritic knee classified as type I was type I.


Detailed Description:
Study groups and design OA group Data for consecutive OA patients with knee pain who underwent primary TKA by one senior surgeon between August 2021 and July 2023 at a single institution were analyzed retrospectively. A total of 273 patients underwent long-leg radiographs. The following 27 patients were excluded from this study: prior total hip arthroplasty, 2; obvious bony deficiency of the femur or tibia, 10; simultaneous flexion of the knee and rotation of the leg on radiographs, 15. CPAK distribution of the remaining 246 cases(unilateral, 15; bilateral, 231; totally 477 knees) was examined.

healthy group Data for consecutive visitors at outpatient clinic who underwent long-leg radiographs but without any sign of cartilage degeneration or medical history of low extremity between January 2023 and July 2023 at the same institution were analyzed retrospectively. A total of 136 visitors were recruited. The following 18 visitors were excluded from this study: extra-articular deformity of the femur or tibia, 15; simultaneous flexion of the knee and rotation of the leg on radiographs, 13; poor quality image, 1. CPAK distribution of the remaining 107 cases(214 knees) was examined.

Radiological measurements All participants underwent standard digital long leg radiographs. The mechanical axis of the femur was marked from the centre of the femoral head to the centre of the knee. The centre of the head was marked using the concentric-circle method to identify the centre. The centre of the ankle was marked as the point on the talar dome at mid-width. The mHKA angle was the angle subtended by the mechanical axes of the femur and tibia. The LDFA was defined as the lateral angle formed between the femoral mechanical axis and the joint line of the distal femur. The MPTA was defined as the medical angle formed between the tibial mechanical axis and the joint line of the proximal tibia."

Title: Phased Multisite Cluster Randomized Trial Testing Screening, Brief Intervention, Referral to Treatment for People That Use Tobacco, Alcohol, and Non-prescription Drugs

Status: COMPLETED


Brief Summary:
Alarming rates of unhealthy alcohol, non-prescription drug, and tobacco use highlight the preventable health risks of substance abuse and the urgent need to advance behavioral health systems. Screening, Brief Intervention, and Referral to Treatment (SBIRT) is an efficacious and effective strategy for the delivery of early intervention and treatment services for people with substance use disorders as well as for those who are at-risk for developing these disorders. A mixed methods phased cluster randomized approach is used to evaluate SBIRT implementation in one medical surgical unit from each of 14 hospitals to inform SBIRT implementation methods for rural, community and urban settings in Indiana. The long-term objective is to develop an SBIRT toolkit to disseminate and sustain SBIRT use to increase the screening of substance use, delivery of brief interventions, and referral to treatment services. A broader dissemination will follow based on results of this study.


Detailed Description:
Aim 1: Test if implementation of SBIRT improves processes of care for hospital inpatients currently using tobacco, alcohol or non-prescription drugs.

Aim 2: Estimate the cost of SBIRT implementation and delivery for the health system.

Design and Sample:

A phased cluster randomized mixed methods design using a wait-list usual care control on one medical surgical unit in 14 hospitals will be conducted. The intervention is an SBIRT toolkit.

Each hospital within the healthcare system is eligible to participate, and has agreed to participate (N=14). A computer generated allocation based on a stratified random sampling approach using SPSS was used to randomize hospitals into an intervention (Group 1, n=7) or wait-list usual care control (Group 2, n=7) group. Prior to randomization, hospitals were stratified by type (academic health center, community hospital, or critical access hospital). Allocation to the intervention or wait-list usual care control groups is based on cluster, and participants will be aware of their cluster allocation. One medical surgical unit within each hospital will be selected by the nurse executive to participate. All hospitals will receive the intervention. Group 1 (n=7) hospitals will participate in the implementation and intervention first, with Group 2 (n=7) following six months later.

Methods:

Smoking cessation practices will be collected from nurses (N=560) at baseline. SBIRT use will be collected from nurses on randomly selected days via survey. Observations of SBIRT use and interviews with study coordinators will also be conducted."

Title: Preoperative Serial Casting, Stretching, and Massage Therapy Package for Dupuytren's Patients With Severe Proximal Interphalangeal Joint Contracture: A Feasibility Study Protocol for a Randomised Trial

Status: NOT_YET_RECRUITING


Brief Summary:
We are running a small study to test whether a special type of therapy - including casting, stretching, and massage - might help improve recovery after Dupuytren's Fasciectomy.

The study is taking place at Dorset County Hospital and will involve people who are already scheduled for surgery and have a permanent bend of 30 degrees or more in the middle joint of one or more fingers.

The therapy will be given before surgery to see if it helps people get a better result afterwards.

We want to find out:

* Who would be suitable to take part in a future, larger study
* Which results are most important to measure (like finger movement or grip strength)
* How many people complete the full therapy and follow-up We'll also speak to patients and healthcare professionals to understand how acceptable and practical this therapy is.

The goal is to see whether it's possible and worthwhile to run a larger study in the future, to find out if pre-surgery therapy can become a helpful part of treatment for people undergoing Dupuytren's Fasciectomy.


Detailed Description:
Dupuytren's disease is a common and progressively disabling condition affecting the connective tissue of the palm of the hand. It causes fibrosis of the palmar fascia, which can lead to one or more fingers becoming incapable of full extension, adopting a fixed flexion contracture. This loss of extension can significantly impair hand function and limit daily activities. While surgery (typically fasciectomy) remains the most effective treatment for Dupuytren's contracture, outcomes are often less favourable when the deformity involves the proximal interphalangeal joint, particularly in severe cases where the contracture exceeds 30 degrees.

This feasibility study investigates whether a short course of preoperative therapy, delivered before surgery, can help improve recovery and outcomes after Dupuytren's Fasciectomy. The intervention includes:

* Heat application
* Stretching and massage
* Serial casting - a method of gently lengthening tight tissue by applying and adjusting a soft cast weekly prior to surgery The treatment is designed to gently lengthen tight tissues and increase joint range of movement in the affected fingers prior to surgery, with the goal of improving movement and function after surgery."

Title: Pilot Study of Bilateral Pedunculo-Pontine Nucleus (PPN) Deep Brain Stimulation for Patients With Parkinson Disease (PD) Who Have Persistent Gait Disturbance, Despite Bilateral Subthalamic Nucleus (STN) Deep Brain Stimulation

Status: WITHDRAWN


Brief Summary:
Background:

\- Deep brain stimulation (DBS) in the subthalamic nucleus (STN) is an approved treatment for Parkinson s disease. It stimulates a part of the brain that helps control symptoms like tremor, stiffness, and slow movements. However, many people continue to have unsteadiness and slowness while walking, trouble swallowing, and speech problems even with STN DBS. Another type of DBS focuses on a part of the brain called the pedunculopontine nucleus (PPN). PPN DBS has improved walking in some people with Parkinson's disease. Researchers want to see if combining the two types of DBS may help control symptoms better than STN DBS alone.

Objectives:

* To see if PPN DBS can help walking, balance, speaking, and swallowing in those who already have STN DBS.
* To study how the DBS combination affects brain function.

Eligibility:

\- Individuals with Parkinson s disease who had STN DBS surgery at least 1 year ago, but still have difficulty walking, swallowing, and speaking.

Design:

* Participants will be screened with a physical exam and medical history. They will also have neurological tests and other tests to measure Parkinson s disease symptoms.
* This study requires eight visits over 1 year. One of the visits will be a 9- to 10-day admission to the NIH Clinical Center for DBS surgery.
* Participants will have PPN DBS surgery. The surgery will be done in two steps. In the first step, the leads will be placed in the brain. In the second step, 1 week later, the stimulator device will be placed in the chest or abdomen.
* One month after the surgery, participants will have a study visit to program the PPN DBS device to find settings that will improve walking and balance.
* Participants will have study visits 2, 3, 6, and 12 months after surgery. Each visit will be used to check the stimulators and make any adjustments needed to try to improve walking and balance or to lessen side effects. Participants will have tests of walking and balance, speech, and swallowing. Some tests will be done with different combinations of the stimulators on or off to see the effects of each set of stimulators.


Detailed Description:
OBJECTIVE:

1. Determine if bilateral Pedunculo-Pontine Nucleus (PPN) Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) will improve gait and balance problems in Parkinson Disease (PD) patients whose other disease features have responded to bilateral subthalamic nucleus (STN) DBS and medications
2. Determine if bilateral PPN DBS will improve swallowing function in Parkinson Disease patients treated with bilateral STN DBS and medication
3. Obtain electrophysiological data related to PPN

Title: Challenges in Achieving Adequate Dietary Status of Women of Reproductive Age (NutriFem)

Status: ENROLLING_BY_INVITATION


Brief Summary:
The aim of the study is to investigate the dietary habits of women of reproductive age (20-49 years). We aim to obtain epidemiological data on the intake and adequacy of key macronutrients and micronutrients, as well as to explore associations with various health indicators. Additionally, we will focus on the nutritional status of subgroups with specific dietary practices, such as vegetarians and vegans.


Detailed Description:
Key scientific challenges addressed in this study are to investigate the dietary habits and nutritional status of women of reproductive age, to provide epidemiological data on the nutrient intakes in this group (including intakes of key micronutrients) and investigate their relationship with various markers of health. We will evaluate dietary behaviours and special dietary practices among women of reproductive age in Slovenia, through age-representative sampling approach. We will also detailly assess dietary supplementation practices in this population group. Dietary intakes of macro and key micronutrients and nutritional/health status will be evaluated using a cross-sectional epidemiological study.

Further we will investigate links between dietary behaviours with nutritional and health status in order to identify increased nutritional and health risk, as well as potential benefits of different dietary practices. We will particularly focus into following sub-groups of women: omnivorous women, that do not follow any special diet, women that follow vegetarian diet, and women that follow vegan diet. In order to investigate the status of the key micronutrients, standard blood biomarkers will be used. This will allow us to determine nutritional status for iron, folate, vitamin B12 and vitamin D. Body composition will be estimated using bioelectrical impedance spectroscopy (BIS). Other measurements of health-related parameters will include tissue protein density using ultrasonography.

Study results will give insights into the nutritional status in general group of women of reproductive age and enable us to identify links between dietary behaviours with nutritional as well as health status. Through that approach we will be able to identify potential risk for deficiencies of nutrients in studied population group.

Applying a highly multidisciplinary approach and building on previous research we will address the following:

* evaluate dietary behaviours of women of reproductive age (20-49 years) through representative sampling approach. This will enable identification of diet related risks in this group.
* determine dietary supplementation practices of women of reproductive age (20-49 years). This will allow us to better estimate intakes of specific nutrients, as supplements can be important dietary source of nutrients."

Title: A Randomised Controlled Trial Comparing the Effectiveness of Heparin Bonded or Antibiotic Impregnated Central Venous Catheters (CVCs) With Standard CVCs for the Prevention of Hospital Acquired Blood Stream Infection in Children

Status: COMPLETED


Brief Summary:
Most children admitted to paediatric intensive care units (PICU) need to have medicines given to them into their veins using a narrow tube, so they do not need repeated injections. This tube is called a central venous catheter. Occasionally these catheters can cause infections in the blood and sometimes the tubes can get blocked by small blood clots.

Some intensive care units already use antibiotic or heparin coated catheters, but there is no proof that these are better than the standard ones at preventing infections. Most of the PICU's in this country use standard lines. The only way to find out for certain is to compare children who are given antibiotic or heparin coated catheters with those who are given standard ones in a clinical trial. Because we do not know which type of catheter is best, the type of catheter each child receives in the study will be decided randomly by chance.

Each child in the trial will have the same chance of getting any of these three catheters:

* Standard central venous catheter (not coated).
* Heparin coated central venous catheter. Heparin is a medicine that can stop blood from clotting and might stop the tubes being blocked and infections in the blood.
* Antibiotic coated central venous catheter. Antibiotics can be used to kill bacteria which cause the infections.

The aim of this study is to see how the three types of catheters compare in reducing the amount of blood infections in children. We will also look at the costs involved. We hope to recruit 1200 children in the UK over 2 years. We hope that the information we get from this study will guide policy about purchasing impregnated Central Venous Catheters across the NHS and thereby improve treatment for children in the future.

Title: Health Qigong Alleviates Depressive Symptoms in Older Adults Through Enhanced Executive Attention: a Randomized Controlled Trial

Status: NOT_YET_RECRUITING


Brief Summary:
The goal of this randomized controlled trial is to test whether executive attention unpacks the antidepressant effect of Baduanjin (a form of health qigong) in older adults.

The main questions it aims to answer are:

* Is Baduanjin an effective treatment to enhance executive attention in older adults with depressive symptoms?
* Does Baduanjin work through enhanced executive attention to alleviate depressive symptoms in older adults? Researchers will compare Baduanjin with waitlist control. Participants will receive 12-week Baduanjin training (two sessions per week and 60 min per session).


Detailed Description:
Baduanjin is a type of health qigong that has been shown to effectively reduce depressive symptoms in older adults. However, the cognitive mechanism that explains such antidepressant effect remains unclear. Executive attention represents the cognitive processing that deals with interference and conflict, and it is likely to be a mechanism to unpack Baduanjin's treatment effect on depressive symptoms. There is also a lack of understanding of Badunajin's effects on brain activation in depressed older adults. To address these knowledge gaps, we propose a fully powered randomized controlled trial (RCT) with 198 older adults with at least mild depressive symptoms. They will be randomly assigned to either the active intervention group (12-week Baduanjin training) or the waitlist control group. The primary outcome is executive attention. Secondary outcomes include depressive symptoms, amplitudes of N2 and P3 components (i.e., components of event-related potentials in brain) during attention tasks, and alerting and orienting networks of attention. These outcomes will be assessed at baseline and post-intervention (12 weeks after baseline). Repeated measures ANOVA will be used to test for treatment effects on the primary outcome. Executive attention's mediation effect on the linkage between group (intervention vs waitlist control) and depressive symptoms will be tested with SPSS Macro PROCESS. The Baduanjin-related enhancement in N2 amplitude, P3 amplitude, alerting, and orienting will be explored with repeated measures ANOVA, respectively. Correlation analyses will be used to evaluate the association (i) between changes in N2 and P3 amplitudes and changes in executive attention and (ii) between changes in N2 and P3 amplitudes and changes in depressive symptoms.


Eligibility Criteria:
Inclusion Criteria:

* have mild or severer levels of depressive symptoms, as indicated by Geriatric Depression Scale scores of 5 or above or Depression Anxiety and Stress Scale-21 depression subscale scores of 4 or above

Title: A 12 Month, Single-center, Non-randomized, Open-label Study of Outcomes of Intermediate Risk Maryland Aggregate Pathology Index (MAPI) Scores in de Novo Renal Transplant Recipients

Status: COMPLETED


Brief Summary:
This will be a pilot study to investigate the use of belatacept (BMS) therapy in kidney transplant patients who have a MAPI score of greater than or equal to 8. The MAPI (Maryland Aggregate Pathology Index) score is a preimplantation donor scoring system which has five histopathological parameters that impact long-term kidney outcomes. Many kidney transplant recipients use calcineurin inhibitors (CNIs) as one of their anti-rejection medi cations. Kidney function may be affected by anti-rejection medications known as calcineurin inhibitors (CNIs). Sometimes CNIs can lead to toxicities and eventually loss of the kidney or episodes of chronic allograft nephropathy (CAN). Avoiding CNI immunosuppression and using belatacept therapy (BMS) instead, may be associated with improved kidney transplant outcomes.

Title: Reduced Intestinal Motility in Inflammatory Crohn's Disease - Optimisation Studies in Healthy Volunteers

Status: COMPLETED


Brief Summary:
Crohn's disease (CD) is becoming more common. One of the main features of this disease is weight loss and malnutrition with symptoms such as tummy aches and bloating. These problems have a strong negative effect on the patients' quality of life but the causes of these problems are not well understood.

Enteroendocrine cells are nutrient sensors in the bowel that secrete special chemicals (called hormones) that control appetite and the movements all the gut. The investigators think that this control mechanism goes wrong in Crohn's patients and they have set off to do more research on this. Looking at the inside work of the gut has always been difficult and at times unpleasant for patients, however recent developments in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are allowing the investigators to study the workings of the gut in greater detail and without discomfort for the patients.

Before studying the Crohn's patients it is necessary to run a set of pilot experiments in healthy volunteers using a test meal and subsequent MRI imaging to look at the motion of the gut. This validation stage of the methodology is essential before embarking in more detailed studies in the patients.


Detailed Description:
Background: Poor nutrition in Crohn's disease (CD) is common but poorly understood. Apart from disease burden and repeated surgery, reduction in appetite might be an aetiological factor.

Enteroendocrine cells (EC) are intraluminal nutrient sensors. They play a pivotal role in orchestrating physiological functions in the gastrointestinal tract. Sensing the nutrient content of the lumen, they secrete multiple peptides and amines that control gut secretory and motor functions. CD patients with small bowel inflammation show increased expression in EC peptides with exaggerated postprandial responses in anorectic EC hormones. This is associated with symptoms of nausea and anorexia, with EC-peptide expression decreasing to normality in remission.

There has been a longstanding interest on the effect of CD on gastric emptying and gastrointestinal motility.

Recent technological advances have allowed us to use magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to measure both disease activity, intestinal motility and whole gut transit.

Reduced intestinal motility has been recently shown in CD patients with active terminal ileal disease. A significant negative correlation is observed between terminal ileal motility and histological, biochemical and radiological measures of disease activity. Intestinal hypomotility may be observed in proximal unaffected segments of small bowel as well.

An increase in EC activity could potentially lead to altered appetite and symptoms of nausea through delayed gastric emptying and most importantly delayed small bowel transit."

Title: Combination Treatment of Nucleoside （Acid）Analogue (NAs) and Pegylated Interferon α-2b for NAs Treated, Hepatitis B Related, Compensatory Cirrhosis Patients With Low Level Hepatitis b Virus Surface Antigen (HBsAg)

Status: UNKNOWN


Brief Summary:
The study aims to demonstrate that whether treatment of nucleoside （acid）analogues (NAs) plus pegylated interferon (Peg IFN) α-2b for those NAs treated, low level of HBsAg, hepatitis B related compensatory cirrhosis patients will result in higher HBsAg clearance rate and reduce the risk of liver cancer. The investigators plan to enroll about 84 hepatitis B related compensatory cirrhosis patients, who have received NAs treatment more than 1 year with the level of HBsAg \<1000IU/ml. These participants will be devided into 2 groups. Group A will receive the treatment of NAs plus Peg IFNα-2b. Group B will be treated with NAs as before enrollment. The participants in both groups will be followed up for 96 weeks.

The primary endpoint is to compare the clearance rate of HBsAg between two groups. The secondary endpoint includes: (1) comparing the incidence of liver cancer during the 96 weeks follow-up, (2) comparing adverse side effects between the 2 groups. (3) comparing the virological and biochemical responses between the 2 groups.


Detailed Description:
Clearance of hepatitis B virus surface antigen (HBsAg) is considered to be the ultimate therapeutic goal for hepatitis B patients, for it is related with low incidence of fibrosis and liver cancer. The investigators' previous study show that nucleoside （acid）analogues (NAs) treated, non-cirrhosis hepatitis B patients switched to /or combined with pegylated interferon (Peg IFN)α-2b could obtain a higher HBsAg clearance rate. Hence, the investigators' hypothesis is that treatment of NAs plus Peg IFNα-2b for those NAs treated, low level of HBsAg, hepatitis B related compensatory cirrhosis patients result in higher HBsAg clearance rate and reduce the risk of liver cancer.

The investigators plan to enroll about 84 hepatitis B related compensatory cirrhosis patients, who have received NAs treatment more than 1 year with the level of HBsAg \<1000IU/ml. These participants will be devided into 2 groups according to their wishes. Group A will receive the treatment of NAs (patients previously treated with telbivudine will be changed to entecavir) plus Peg IFNα-2b （180ug per week, the dose will be changed to 135ug or 90ug per week during the treatment if patients could not tolerate the side effects of Peg IFNα-2b）. Peg IFNα-2b treatment will be performed until HBsAg \<0.05IU/ml, with a maximum duration of 48 weeks. Group B will be treated with NAs as before enrollment. The participants in both groups will be followed up for 96 weeks.

The primary endpoint is to compare the clearance rate of HBsAg between two groups."

Title: The Effects of the Standard Process 21 Day Purification Program, on Serum Lipids, C-Reactive Protein, Homocystine, Blood Pressure, and Heart Rate Variability in Normal Weight and Overweight Participants Who Have Total Cholesterol Levels Over 180.

Status: UNKNOWN


Brief Summary:
To determine the effects of a commercially available dietary modification plus nutritional supplement regimen, the Standard Process 21 day Purification Program (SPPP), on serum lipids, C-reactive protein (CRP), homocysteine, body mass index (BMI), body weight, blood pressure, and heart rate variability (HRV) in normal weight (BMI \< 26) and overweight (BMI 26 or above) participants who have total cholesterol levels over 180.


Detailed Description:
Elevated low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol concentrations are a risk factor for cardiovascular diseases. (1) Cholesterol lowering drugs are the most frequently prescribed medications in the U.S. and are known to have muscle, kidney and liver side effects for some users. Recent reviews conclude that benefits outweigh risks reporting statin and other cholesterol-lowering drugs to be safe and effective for most users. (2, 3, 4, 5) The new blood cholesterol level guidelines may recommend that more people take cholesterol lowering medications. According to the American Heart Association (AHA), total cholesterol levels should be below 180 mg/dL, with levels from 200 mg/dL to 239 mg/dL considered borderline high. Total cholesterol of 240 mg/dL and above is considered high. (6) However, published studies on the effect of blood lipids suggested that the actual cholesterol level itself is not the most important risk factor. It is the ratio between the level of total cholesterol and HDL that played a major role in the cardiovascular risk. The ideal HDL/cholesterol ratio should be higher than 25%. The ideal triglyceride/cholesterol ratio should be below 2.0. It is estimated that over 50 million adults in the U.S. have lipid levels higher than the above recommendations. (6) For persons who prefer conservative care, dietary modification is considered a first approach to the treatment and control of high cholesterol. (1, 7, 8) Hypertension is another risk factor for cardiovascular diseases and has close links to high blood cholesterol. (8) Between 40 and 50 million Americans have hypertension, which is defined as systolic blood pressure of at least 140 mm Hg or diastolic blood pressure of at least 90 mm Hg. (8) Hypertension is strongly, continuously, and independently related to coronary artery disease (CAD), stroke, renal disease, and all-cause mortality. For every 7.5-mm Hg increase in diastolic blood pressure, CAD risk increases 29% and stroke risk increases 46%. These risks have been shown for women as well as for men. Even within the high-normal blood pressure range, higher measurements result in greater risk of cardiovascular diseases."

Title: Economic Evaluation of Treatment of HIV With Zidovudine/Stavudine and Tenofovir Regimen: A Cost Effectiveness Study

Status: COMPLETED


Brief Summary:
The purpose of this study is to compare clinical, economical and quality of life (QOL) outcomes in patients living with HIV on zidovudine/stavudine regimen and tenofovir regimen. This study will be an unblinded randomized trial. The first step will be empirical data collection for one year for calculating the incremental cost effectiveness ratio (ICER). The second step will be to perform a simulation model for calculating long term ICER.


Detailed Description:
The drug regimen for treatment of HIV at the free ART centers in India includes stavudine/zidovudine and lamivudine with nevirapine. Approximately 20-30% of the patients on this regimen experience drug toxicity within the first six months of treatment.

The tenofovir based regimen is one of the least toxic regimens with less than 5% of patients experiencing toxicity. Tenofovir based regimen is not considered as the first choice for ART in the Indian governmental program, because it is more expensive than the other drug regimens, in spite of better clinical outcomes in resource limited settings. The cost of treatment with stavudine/zidovudine is presumed to be less expensive and is the preferred first line treatment, but we believe that although the direct cost to the government is less, patients on zidovudine/stavudine regimen have to spend more money for additional hospital visits and admissions, laboratory investigations and other medications due to ART induced toxicity.

There are no published data including economic, clinical and quality of life outcomes to compare the two regimens from India. Hence, this unblinded randomized pragmatic comparative effectiveness study will seek to identify the best treatment for HIV patients based on the incremental cost effectiveness ratio (ICER), quality of life (QOL) and clinical outcomes.

The clinical outcomes include viral suppression, change in the CD4 and proportion of patients with toxicity and opportunistic infections. Direct costs for the treatment will be calculated. The QOL scores will be estimated and compared between the regimens using questionnaires. QOL scores and direct cost will be used as utilities for calculating ICER.


Eligibility Criteria:
Inclusion Criteria:

* All treatment naïve patients above 18 years confirmed with the diagnosis of HIV
* Eligible for initiation of cART based on the National Aids Control Organization of India

Title: Clinical Evaluation of a Non-Invasive Hypoglycemia Detector in a Glycogen Storage Disease Population

Status: TERMINATED


Brief Summary:
Glycogen storage disease (GSD) patients frequently experience periods of hypoglycemia, putting them at risk for several complications, such as hepatomegaly, adenomas, and cirrhosis. As of now, glycogen storage disease patients are limited to using finger stick glucose meters to monitor their glycemia at home. Diabetes Sentry, a non-invasive hypoglycemia detector designed like a watch, has been available for diabetic patients to non-invasively alert for hypoglycemia, but has never been tested in a GSD population. The investigators propose to test the accuracy of the Diabetes Sentry on patients with GSD types 0, I, III, VI, and IX, by measuring their metabolic markers every two hours, as well as whenever the device alerts for hypoglycemia. If accurate, it could be a useful tool for GSD patients in managing hypoglycemia, both clinically and at home.


Detailed Description:
As a participant the following will take place:

The Diabetes Sentry device, which is non-invasive and is worn on the wrist will be used while an inpatient at the University of Florida Health \& Shands Hospital. Participants will be monitored for the duration of the observational period on the unit, an expected average will be 24 hours. The device is designed to alarm during periods of perspiration and drops in body temperature. When this occurs, a blood draw will be taken to test for glucose, lactate, and ketone values at those times if there is not an already scheduled clinical care blood draw for normal clinical care.


Eligibility Criteria:
Inclusion Criteria:

* Patients diagnosed and clinically treated at the University of Florida with any of the glycogen storage diseases I, III, VI, IX, 0 will be asked to participate in this study.

Title: Return to Work Among Cancer Survivors With Treatment-induced Survivorship Syndromes

Status: COMPLETED


Brief Summary:
The investigators plan to investigate the consequences of late effects (radiation-induced survivorship syndromes) after radiotherapy in Gynecological and Prostate cancer survivors on return to work (Yes/No) and if RTW happened then time to RTW.

In addition, whether general health, type of work (occupation), work environment factors, individual factors (lifestyle, socioeconomic status etc.), contribute to the adverse late effects of radiotherapy and these Gynecological cancer survivors have a higher risk for disability pension/long term sickness absence (NOT Return to work).


Detailed Description:
Occurrence of cancer diagnoses are rising, and both disease and treatments are aggressive. Due to advancement in medical technology, improved therapy and/or early detection the overall survival rates are also improving.

Some of the most common cancer types, such as breast cancer, prostate cancer, cervical cancer, and colorectal cancer have high cure rates when detected early and treated according to best practices. Many of these cancer survivors are of working age and are likely to return to work. Women who survive cervical cancer and men who survive testicular cancer typically have three to four decades left in working life.

However, return to work (RTW) among cancer survivors may not be similar to RTW among long-term sickness absentees due to other diagnoses. Cancer is a life threatening disease and cancer diagnose is a life changing event. The emotional shock after the cancer diagnosis may be associated with low psychological well-being even two years after prostate cancer surgery.

The successful cancer treatment concludes with the lifelong consequences of surgery, irradiation, cytotoxic chemotherapy, biological anticancer substances or other drugs in the treatment. The ionizing radiation that eliminates malignant cells may trigger long-lasting pathophysiological processes in the normal tissue and affect the health of the survivors with lifelong treatment-induced survivorship diseases. In a recent study, Steineck et al, identified five radiation-induced survivorship syndromes affecting bowel health in a cohort of gynecological cancer; urgency syndrome (30%), leakage syndrome (26%), excessive gas discharge(15%), excessive mucus discharge (16%) and blood discharge (10%).

There is a lack of knowledge about how these side effects of cancer treatment affect the degree of work ability and return to work. Clinical experience suggests that many cancer survivors have reduced work ability. There is a need for scientific studies that shed light on the side effects of cancer treatment and their relation to work ability.

Title: Quality of Colonoscopies Under Kalinox During the COVID 19 Epidemic

Status: COMPLETED


Brief Summary:
Feedback: during the COVID-19 epidemic, access to operating theaters was restricted so that anesthetists and nurse anesthetists could reinforce the resuscitation workforce.

The MEOPA was used as an alternative to sedation, allowing colonoscopies to be carried out, colon polyps and colorectal cancers to be detected.


Detailed Description:
Colonoscopy is a major procedure for screening for cancers and diagnosing colorectal lesions. In France, general anesthesia remains the most widely used sedation method for colonoscopy. Faced with several constraints such as difficulty of access to the operating room, length of hospitalization and contraindications to general anesthesia, several sedation methods have been adopted.

The best known is sedation by MEOPA (equimolar mixture of oxygen protoxide of nitrogen) marketed under the name of Kalinox. It is offered as a second-line treatment after general anesthesia.

Since March 2020, the COVID-19 health crisis has forced us to change our care. Faced with restricted access to the operating room (anesthetists and nurse anesthetists requisitioned to participate in the care of patients in intensive care), colonoscopy under MEOPA was offered to patients who could have benefited from general anesthesia before the crisis. This monocentric retrospective descriptive study at the CHSF (Centre Hospitalier Sud Francilien) will make it possible to assess the quality of colonoscopies performed under MEOPA in the first line.

This is a feedback, the MEOPA having allowed us to continue and maintain the performance of screening colonoscopies during the COVID 19 epidemic.

Title: BASH-PC: Bariatric Arterial Embolization for Men Starting Hormones for Prostate Cancer

Status: WITHDRAWN


Brief Summary:
The standard of care for obese men starting Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) is physician based dietary and exercise counseling. Interventions to lessen the harmful effects of ADT are needed yet have been limited. Exercise is one strategy that has been attempted however there is conflicting data as to whether or not exercise effectively improves body mass, results in sustained weight loss, improvements in metabolic risk profiles including glucose tolerance and lipid profiles in men starting ADT, or has any effect of progression of cancer. Dietary interventions have been attempted without clear improvement in weight, metabolic factors, quality of life or cancer progression. Bariatric arterial embolization (BAE), given it results in weight loss in obese men and women without cancer, may be able to stave off the harmful side effects of ADT by inducing weight loss. Therefore, the investigators hypothesize that Bariatric Arterial embolization (BAE), done prior to initiation of ADT, will mitigate the weight gain and metabolic side effects associated with ADT, by inducing weight loss of at least 5% in obese men with biochemical recurrent prostate cancer starting ADT.

The primary objective is to determine if BAE, done prior to ADT initiation in obese men (with obesity related comorbid condition) with biochemically recurrent prostate cancer, can induce 5% or greater weight loss at 6 months.


Eligibility Criteria:
Inclusion Criteria:

* Willing and able to provide written informed consent and HIPAA authorization for the release of personal health information (HIPAA authorization will be included in the informed consent)

Title: A Phase II Clinical Trial of Bevacizumab Beginning Concurrently With a Sequential Regimen of Doxorubicin and Cyclophosphamide Followed by Docetaxel and Capecitabine as Neoadjuvant Therapy Followed by Postoperative Bevacizumab Alone for Women With Locally Advanced Breast Cancer

Status: COMPLETED


Brief Summary:
Bevacizumab is an angiogenesis inhibitor which means it works to stop blood vessel formation in tumors. Without new blood vessels, the growth of a tumor is slowed. Chemotherapy drugs kill cancer cells more directly. This study will evaluate:

* How bevacizumab, given with chemotherapy before surgery, and then bevacizumab given alone after surgery, will affect locally advanced breast tumors
* Side effects from adding bevacizumab to chemotherapy
* Whether adding bevacizumab to chemotherapy for breast cancer will affect the heart
* If receiving bevacizumab will have any effect on how patients recover from surgery
* Side effects of the combinations of drugs used in this study


Detailed Description:
Initial trials of neoadjuvant chemotherapy administered for locally advanced tumors, including those in breast cancer, demonstrated therapy could induce sufficient tumor regression to allow for the resection of otherwise unresectable tumors. Subsequent demonstration of the equivalence of lumpectomy to mastectomy in patients with operable breast cancer, stimulated interest in the concept of using preoperative chemotherapy to reduce large, but operable, primary tumors to allow for lumpectomy in women who would otherwise require a mastectomy. Given the data from previous studies, it is appropriate to continue development of sequential doxorubicin/cyclophosphamide/docetaxel regimens to improve on clinical and pathologic response rates. FB-4 is a Phase II, single arm study for women with locally advanced human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative breast cancer diagnosed by core needle biopsy. The primary aim of the study is to determine the pathologic complete response rate in the breast following neoadjuvant chemotherapy combined with bevacizumab.


Eligibility Criteria:
Inclusion Criteria:

* Patients must be female.
* The patient must be greater than/equal to 18 years old

Title: Homonymous Hemianopia in Childhood

Status: UNKNOWN


Brief Summary:
The study will consist of two connected components at a single centre. Phase 1 is observational, phenotyping children with Homonymous hemianopia (HH). Phase 2 is a pilot double blind cross over RCT in which segmental prisms are compared with sham prisms in glasses.


Detailed Description:
The project will consist of two connected pieces of work. The primary phase of the study will examine children with a diagnosis of homonymous hemianopia to investigate the clinical spectrum, and undertake questionnaires to measure vision related quality of life and visual function. Functional evaluation will also include optical coherence tomography, electrophysiological and eye movement studies.

If the recruited children or young people meet the inclusion criteria for phase two they will then be given the option of taking part in phase 2 - a pilot randomised cross-over trial of prism glasses. The order in which the prism lenses and the sham lenses are given will be randomised, with each worn for four weeks. The child or young person and their parent carer will be asked for their opinion on each pair, with the primary outcome question ""If the trial was to end today would you want to continue wearing these lenses?"" (Yes/no). Visual function will be measured behaviourally using a questionnaire based tool, and functionally utilising an eye movement recording of a visual search task.

The project consists of two connected studies. The primary phase of the study will examine children with homonymous hemianopia to investigate the spectrum of eye features. This will involve doing several different eye tests, similar to ones used in clinical practice. All children will have a photo of their eye taken that measures the thickness of the nerve at the back of the eye. They will also have electrodes put on their head and around their eyes that will measure the brains response to different visual stimuli. This is not painful and they children can choose a carton to watch during it to make it more entertaining. The children will also have their eye movements measured as they follow a target on a TV screen towards the non-seeing and seeing half of the vision. The children will also be asked to do some drawing tasks such as putting numbers on a clock face, or drawing a house to see how much they do or don't ignore the side with the visual impairment. They will also undertake age appropriate questionnaires to measure their vision related quality of life and visual function. This will give us more information about what impact the HH has on different aspects of their lives.

If the recruited children in phase 1 meet the inclusion criteria for phase 2 they will be invited to take part. Phase 2 is a trial of prisms glasses."

Title: Impaired Family Dynamics Leads to Non Compliance in Type I Diabetes

Status: TERMINATED


Brief Summary:
This study will test the hypothesis that certain parenting styles are associated with greater non-adherence to therapy in children and teens with type 1 diabetes. To test their hypothesis, the investigators will use standardized and validated questionnaires for parents and children to determine: parenting styles (the investigators will measure parental strictness, parental attachment, and parental monitoring), parent ability to cope with stress, parent comfort with the parenting role, parent and child level of depression and parent perception of financial resources. The investigators will also measure parent and child's perception of the child's underlying temperament and parent-child conflict. The investigators will correlate these findings with both parent and child subjective measures of adherence to therapy. The investigators will also obtain objective measures of therapy adherence including: HbA1c, number of hospitalizations for diabetes ketoacidosis and number of missed outpatient appointments. These measures will be correlated with our other findings.

Title: Determining the Effect of Care Package Implementation in Preventing Delirium in Patients Undergoing Coronary Artery Bypass Graft Surgery

Status: RECRUITING


Brief Summary:
This research investigates the effectiveness of a care package used in the care of patients undergoing coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery in preventing postoperative delirium. CABG surgery is a common procedure used to increase blood flow to the heart and is typically applied in patients with severe cardiac diseases. However, this procedure can increase the risk of postoperative delirium, especially among elderly and critically ill patients.

In this study, the goal is to reduce this risk by implementing a care package. The care package includes optimal pain management, sleep regulation, mobilization, ensuring patient orientation, and appropriate medication management.

The results of the research will be used to determine whether the use of this care package is effective in reducing the risk of delirium after CABG surgery. This could potentially improve patient outcomes and allow for more efficient use of hospital resources.


Detailed Description:
Open-heart surgery is an effective treatment method used in the treatment of heart diseases today. However, after this operation, patients are at risk of postoperative delirium, which negatively affects the patient's recovery process. Open-heart surgery is a commonly performed surgical procedure; despite technological advancements and improvements in hospital care, delirium after open-heart surgery remains a common complicationDelirium, a condition causing acute dysfunction in the brain, leads to changes in patients' mental states and impairments in cognitive functions. Delirium after open-heart surgery is a common complication and can increase the patient's morbidity and mortality. Delirium extends the hospital stay and increases patient care costs. Therefore, it is important to implement a special care package to reduce the risk of delirium. The frequency of delirium in patients undergoing open-heart surgery varies between 20% and 50%. The post-open-heart surgery delirium prevention care package is a series of practices designed to reduce the patient's delirium risk. These practices may include; maintaining a regular sleep pattern, noise control, balancing hormone levels, family proximity, and music therapy.

Antipsychotic drugs, a pharmacological agent, are commonly used in the treatment of delirium. These drugs help to alleviate the symptoms of delirium and make the patient more calm. However, antipsychotic drugs are effective in symptom management and their side effects worsen the patient's condition and the effectiveness of antipsychotic drugs on delirium is doubtful. It is extremely important to avoid routine application of antipsychotic drugs."

Title: 7T MRI Ferumoxytol-Enhanced Characterization of Multiple Sclerosis and Demyelinating Diseases

Status: WITHDRAWN


Brief Summary:
Feraheme (ferumoxytol) is FDA-approved for iron supplementation and is composed of iron oxide nanoparticles classified among the ultra-small superparamagnetic iron oxides (USPIO). In this project we hypothesize that Feraheme could become a sensitive and specific marker of active inflammation in multiple sclerosis. We will explore this hypothesis taking advantage of ultra high field strength (7T) MRI to further increase the effectiveness of the contrast agent Feraheme at revealing inflammatory activity.


Detailed Description:
Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a neurological disorder that affects young adults world-wide. Feraheme (ferumoxytol) is FDA-approved for iron supplementation and is composed of iron oxide nanoparticles classified among the ultra-small superparamagnetic iron oxides (USPIO). After IV injection, the particles are taken up by the monocyte-macrophage system and can also be used to track macrophage infiltration by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) after systemic injection owing to the strong image contrast of the iron-loaded macrophages. Approximately 24 hours after their IV injection, free particles are cleared from the circulation and MR signal alterations are thought to arise from the capture of particles by circulating phagocytic cells that are attracted to inflammatory lesions.

In this project we hypothesize that Feraheme could become a sensitive and specific marker of active inflammation in multiple sclerosis. We will explore this hypothesis by taking advantage of ultra high field strength (7T) MRI to further increase the effectiveness of the contrast agent Feraheme at revealing inflammatory activity.


Eligibility Criteria:
Inclusion Criteria:

* Patients will be included if they are at least 18 years old and meet the revised diagnostic criteria for multiple sclerosis, relapsing remitting type.

Title: Assessing Target Engagement of Terazosin in Healthy Adults

Status: ACTIVE_NOT_RECRUITING


Brief Summary:
The purpose of the study is to assess the target engagement of Terazosin (TZ) in a single cohort of 6 healthy adult participants. During the study participants will undergo PET/CT scans, 7-Tesla MRI scans, blood draws, and an optional lumbar puncture (LP.)


Detailed Description:
The study is a single center, 37-day, controlled pilot study to assess the target engagement of Terazosin (TZ) in a single cohort of 6 healthy adult participants (3 men and 3 women.) During the study participants will undergo PET/CT scans, 7-Tesla MRI scans, blood draws, and an optional lumbar puncture (LP.) Participants will have their baseline ATP levels measured (at 0mg TZ.) They will then take doses of TZ at 1mg and will increase their dose on a weekly basis by 1mg until they reach a total dose of 5mg. ATP levels will be assessed on study days 8 and 36. Participants interested in voluntarily donating a sample of cerebral spinal fluid will undergo an optional lumbar puncture on study day 37.

The purpose of the study is to gain a better understanding of the mechanisms in which TZ acts in the brain. TZ was recently discovered to increase energy levels (in the form of ATP molecules) in the brain by enhancing glycolysis. By using different brain imaging techniques, blood assays and cerebral spinal fluid assays, the study will attempt to: 1) quantify the rate of glycolysis in the brain at different dosages of TZ, 2) quantify ATP levels in the brain at different dosages of TZ, 3) quantify ATP levels in blood at different dosages of TZ, and 4) assess the brain permeability of TZ. It is hoped that knowledge gained from the study will help guide future clinical trials using TZ for the treatment of various neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's Disease.

Title: Placebo-Controlled Study of Uridine for Adolescent Bipolar Depression: a Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy Study

Status: COMPLETED


Brief Summary:
This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of the investigational drug uridine as a treatment for depressed adolescents with bipolar disorder (i.e. ""bipolar depression""). Participants initially randomized to placebo who complete the 6-week protocol will be offered 6 months of open-label uridine treatment and follow-up. Participants initially randomized to uridine will be offered the open-label treatment as well.


Detailed Description:
This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of the investigational drug uridine as a treatment for depressed adolescents with bipolar disorder (i.e. ""bipolar depression"").

In addition to treatment with the investigational drug versus placebo, the study includes a translational neuroimaging component: magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-MRS) brain scans are performed at baseline, and then repeated following 6 weeks of treatment with uridine or placebo. The scans do not use radiation, and are performed on a 3 Tesla MRI system that is approved for clinical use. The scans allow researchers to measure the concentrations of several chemicals in the brain that are believed to be involved in bipolar disorder and depression.

The primary hypothesis is that uridine treatment will be associated with a significant decrease in GLX (i.e. glutamate + glutamine) levels, compared to placebo, in a part of the brain known as the anterior cingulate cortex.

The secondary hypothesis is that decreased depressive symptoms measured with the Children Depression Rating Scale-Revised (CDRS-R) and Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) will be correlated with reductions in GLX.

All participants who complete the initial 6-week protocol, including two brain scans, will be offered 6 months of open-label treatment with uridine.

Title: Application of a Perineal Protection Device in Vacuum-assisted Births: a Prospective Randomized Controlled Trial

Status: COMPLETED


Brief Summary:
Visible birth tears are common in vaginal births, especially in vacuum-assisted births. One aim of obstetrical work is to minimize such injuries by an adequate birth management , for example with a proper perineal support. The medical device ""BabySlide®"" was developed as an auxilliary device for perineal support and already evaluated in a multicenter randomized controlled trial in Schweden in pregnant women during vaginal birth. It could be seen, that the application of the device significantly reduced the rate of vagibal tears and low-grade perineal tearsin the intervention group (with application of the BabySlide®) in contrast to the controlo group (without application of the BabySlide®) by about 10%. In this study, solely 10% of births were ended by vacuum assistance. However, birth tears appear much more often in vacuum-assisted births than in normal spontaneous births. Therefore, the aim of this study is to evaluate the application of the device explicitly in vacuum-assisted births and to investigate if the application should be recommende in vacuum extractions in general in the future.

Title: Phase II Safety and Immunogenicity Study of Quadrivalent Human Papillomavirus (Types 6, 11, 16, 18) L1 Virus-Like Particle (VLP) Vaccine in HIV Infected Children 7 to 12 Years of Age

Status: COMPLETED


Brief Summary:
The purpose of this study is to determine the safety of and immune response to a new human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine in HIV (Human immunodeficiency virus) infected children between the ages of 7 and 12 years.


Detailed Description:
Genital HPV infection is the most common sexually transmitted infection in the world and may lead to genital warts, anogenital dysplasias, and invasive cancers. HIV infected people and others with compromised immunity are at greater risk for HPV-related complications. In particular, researchers are concerned about the risk of HPV infection to women, who may be infected by their male partners, especially if these partners engage in anal intercourse. HIV infected women tend to have multiple types of HPV (associated with a greater risk of HPV-related disease), are less likely to clear HPV-related conditions, and are more likely to progress to HPV-related disease. The quadrivalent HPV (types 6, 11, 16, 18) L1 virus-like particle (VLP) vaccine to be tested in this study was safe and generally well tolerated in previous studies conducted in healthy and HPV-exposed adolescents, young adults, and older women. However, it is still unclear if the vaccine will be safe and will elicit a similar immune response in younger children. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of the novel quadrivalent HPV (Types 6, 11, 16, 18) L1 VLP vaccine in HIV infected children 7 to 12 years of age.

This study had two stages and lasted at least 108 weeks. In Stage I, participants were stratified by CD4 percentage (CD4%) nadir and CD4% at study screening (Stratum A: CD4% Nadir \< 15 and CD4% ≥ 15 at screening, Stratum B: CD4% Nadir ≥ 15 and \< 25 and CD4% ≥ 15 at screening, Stratum C: CD4% Nadir ≥ 25 and CD4% ≥ 25 at screening). Within each stratification group, they were randomly assigned to one of two arms. During Stage I, Arm A (QHPV:Quadrivalent human papillomavirus vaccine) participants received 3 doses of vaccine, while Arm B (Placebo/QHPV) participants received 3 doses of placebo. Participants did not know whether they were receiving vaccine or placebo. Participants received their assigned intervention at study entry and Weeks 8 and 24. At Week 96, Stage II began, and all study participants were told if they received vaccine or placebo in Stage I. Arm A participants received an additional dose of vaccine at Week 96; Arm B participants received doses of vaccine at Weeks 96, 104, and 120. Over the course of the study, there were at least 12 study visits. A physical exam and blood collection occurred at most visits; medical history occurred at selected visits."

Title: The Efficacy of Kinesio Taping as an Adjunct Intervention to Traditional Physical Therapy in the Treatment of Nonspecific Acute Low Back Pain: A Prospective Randomized Controlled Trial

Status: COMPLETED


Brief Summary:
The Purpose of the study was to examine the effect of KinesioTaping (KT) on disability, fear avoidance beliefs and pain intensity in patients with acute non-specific LBP. Materials and Methods: Seventy-eight patients were randomized to an experimental group that received traditional physical therapy plus KT and a control group that received traditional physical therapy alone. Interventions were administered twice a week for four weeks. Assessment tools used were; RMDQ for disability, FABQ for fear-avoidance beliefs and NPRS for pain intensity.


Detailed Description:
This study followed a prospective experimental pretest-posttest control group randomized design with repeated measures. Two groups were included in this study, an experimental group and a control group. Both groups were tested with respect to three main outcomes which are disability, fear avoidance beliefs and pain intensity. Five points of measurements were used; at baseline, at the end of week 1, at the end of week 2, at the end of week 3 and at the end of week 4.

A total of 88 patients with a primary complaint of low back pain were enrolled and consented to participate in the study. Potential study participants were assessed for study eligibility based on the pre-defined inclusion and exclusion criteria. Study flow chart. Subjects were pre-screened for known contraindications and precautions to thrust joint manipulation and exercises.

Title: Post-vaccination Immunization Against SARS-CoV-2 in Patients Undergoing Maintenance With Anti-CD20 Antibodies for Follicular Lymphoma (FL) or Mantle Cell

Status: COMPLETED


Brief Summary:
The anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies, rituximab (R) and obinutuzumab (G), are used as standard maintenance therapy every 2 months for 2 to 3 years in patients with follicular lymphoma (FL) or mantle cell lymphoma (MCL).

This treatment is associated with profound and prolonged B lymphopenia, hypogammaglobulinemia and increased infections. Severe forms of COVID-19 on Rituximab with prolonged carriage of the virus have been reported due to significant impairment of humoral immunity in this context of maintenance therapy.

Therefore, during the COVID-19 epidemic, clinicians are faced with the question of whether to discontinue maintenance therapy or continue treatment. However, the half-life of rituximab is 29 days and lymphopenia continues for up to 9-12 months after stopping injections. Therefore, it is not clear that discontinuation of maintenance therapy will alter the risk of severe SARS-CoV-2.

However, post-vaccination immunization against SARS-CoV-2 by an mRNA vaccine is not known in this context of prolonged treatment with rituximab or obinutuzumab. It is however well established that post-vaccination responses against diphtheria, tetanus, pneumococcus, HBV, or influenza in particular are altered after anti-CD20 antibodies. If the humoral response is crucial in the post-vaccination response, it is also suggested that the preservation of innate immunity and the CD8 response, unaltered by anti-CD20, could also play an important role in the post-vaccination response and virus clearance.

The aim of our study is to evaluate the humoral and post-vaccination T-cell response based on serological data and T-cell production of interferon gamma in response to SARS-CoV-2 specific antigens (Elispot interferon gamma) in this group of patients treated for lymphoma with a long-term anti-CD20 antibody.


Eligibility Criteria:
Inclusion Criteria:

* Age superior to 18 years old
* Patient undergoing maintenance treatment for Mantle Cell Lymphoma or Follicular Lymphoma treated with rituximab or obinutuzumab in complete remission or stable disease between injection #1 and injection #13 or 19 (end of second year or third year)
* Inform consent signed

Exclusion Criteria:

* Documented history of SARS-Cov-2 infection less than 3 months old

Title: Real-Time Validation and Feasibility of the SOFA-2 Score in Adult Intensive Care Units in Türkiye (TR-SOFA2): A Multicenter Prospective Observational Study

Status: NOT_YET_RECRUITING


Brief Summary:
This study aims to evaluate how well a new scoring system called the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment-2 (SOFA-2) works in adult intensive care units in Türkiye.

SOFA-2 is designed to measure the severity of organ dysfunction in critically ill patients using routinely collected clinical and laboratory data. It is an updated version of the original SOFA score and reflects modern intensive care practices.

In this multicenter observational study, adult patients admitted to participating intensive care units will be followed during their ICU stay. SOFA and SOFA-2 scores will be calculated during the first 24 hours of admission, and in patients with longer stays, additional scores will be recorded. No additional tests or treatments will be performed as part of the study.

The main goal of the study is to examine the relationship between SOFA-2 scores and intensive care unit mortality. The results are expected to help clinicians better assess disease severity and outcomes in critically ill patients.


Detailed Description:
This is a multicenter, prospective, observational study designed to evaluate the feasibility and prognostic performance of the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment-2 (SOFA-2) score in adult intensive care units across Türkiye.

Adult patients aged 18 years or older who are admitted to participating intensive care units and remain in the ICU for more than 24 hours will be eligible for inclusion. Pregnant patients, organ donors, patients younger than 18 years, and those with unknown ICU discharge outcomes will be excluded.

Demographic characteristics, reasons for ICU admission, comorbid conditions, and routinely collected clinical and laboratory data will be prospectively recorded using standardized case report forms. SOFA and SOFA-2 scores will be calculated based on data obtained during the first 24 hours following ICU admission. For patients with an ICU stay longer than 72 hours, additional SOFA and SOFA-2 scores will be recorded at 72 hours.

Patients will be followed until ICU discharge or death. No study-specific interventions, additional diagnostic procedures, or changes to standard clinical management will be implemented as part of the study.

The study will assess the feasibility of real-time SOFA-2 score calculation, evaluate its association with ICU mortality, and compare its prognostic performance with the original SOFA score. Analyses will account for the multicenter structure of the study and variations across participating intensive care units."

Title: Pivotal Study of the CADence Device in Detection of Coronary Artery Diseases

Status: COMPLETED


Brief Summary:
This is a multi-center, prospective, non-randomized, double-blinded trial to evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of the CADence device in detecting the existence of clinically significant coronary artery disease as determined by either standard or CT angiography.


Detailed Description:
This is a multi-center, prospective, non-randomized, double-blinded, trial to evaluate the performance of the CADence in detecting the existence of at least one major coronary artery with clinically significant stenosis in a subject is defined as the presence of at least one lesion with ≥ 70% diameter stenosis anywhere in the proximal Left anterior Descending, mid Left anterior Descending, proximal Left Circumflex, mid Left Circumflex , proximal Right Coronary Artery, mid Right Coronary Artery, distal Right Coronary Artery and Obtuse Margin 1, Obtuse Margin 2, and Ramus Intermedius if segment diameter \>2.5 mm or ≥50% diameter stenosis in the Left Main coronary arteries.

Consented subjects will be evaluated with the CADence device and then undergo nuclear stress testing followed by either computed tomography or standard coronary angiography. The maximum expected timeframe between CADence and computed tomography Angiography or standard angiography is 6 weeks.

This is a double-blinded study. All physicians and subjects will be masked to the diagnostic results of the CADence until completion of CADence, nuclear stress, computed tomography or standard coronary angiogram testing for the subjects. Patient care will not be based on the CADence results.

Study participation will conclude after the computed tomography angiography or standard coronary angiography procedure.

computed tomograph or standard coronary angiography are considered acceptable clinical reference standards in this study and are gold standards for detection of coronary artery disease. The experimental unit of this study is the subject. Existence of clinically significant coronary artery disease in a subject is defined as the presence of at least one lesion with ≥ 70% diameter stenosis anywhere in the proximal Left anterior Descending, mid Left anterior Descending, proximal Left Circumflex, mid Left Circumflex, proximal Right Coronary Artery, mid Right Coronary Artery, distal Right Coronary Artery and Obtuse Margin 1, Obtuse Margin 2, and Ramus Intermedius if segment diameter \>2.5 mm or ≥50% diameter stenosis in the Left Main coronary arteries.

The study required sample size is 826 but may enroll up to 1,300 subjects. The sensitivity and specificity of the CADence are expected to be 80% and 73% respectively. Observed sensitivity and specificity will be compared to nuclear stress literature-based performance standards of 83% and 80% respectively using one sample non-inferiority binomial tests with a non-inferiority margin of 15 percentage points."

Title: 4D Flow Cardiac MRI Velocity Mapping in Patients With Pulmonary Hypertension: Estimation of Pulmonary Arterial Pressure and Comparison With Right Heart Catheterization and Doppler Echocardiography

Status: COMPLETED


Brief Summary:
Due to radiation exposure and low but real risk of morbidity and mortality associated with right heart catheterization, non-invasive procedures to estimate mPAP are desired for the diagnosis of PH or to monitor treatment effectiveness. Echocardiography is used as a screening tool to estimate systolic pulmonary arterial pressure (sPAP), but due various limitations, this technique is not considered to be sufficiently accurate for the diagnosis of PH. The aim of 4D flow MRI is to evaluate the complete time-varying tridirectional velocity field in a volume of interest. It enables flow and velocity measurements in a vascular region of interest and visualization of vector plots of blood flow velocity fields. Previous studies have shown on the one hand, correlations between mPAP and hemodynamic parameters obtained by phase contrast MRI and, on the other hand, appearance of a vortical blood flow in the pulmonary artery in PH. More studies are required to confirm 4D MRI as a valuable tool for mPAP estimation in PH.

Following screening echocardiography, all patients will undergo right heart catheterization for PH assessment. Then, all patients will be referred for a complete cardiac MRI exam with the addition of a 4D Flow sequence (does not require supplementary injection of a contrast agent and does not extend the duration of the examination) followed promptly (within the same hour) by a Doppler-echocardiography. The data from each examination will be blindly interpreted from the results of the other one. No follow-up will be required for the study.


Eligibility Criteria:
Inclusion Criteria:

* Age ≥ 18 years old,
* Patient referred for cardiac MRI who previously underwent right heart catheterization for pulmonary hypertension assessment,
* Affiliation to a social security program,
* Ability of the subject to understand and express opposition

Exclusion Criteria:

* Age \<18 years old,

Title: Design and Implementation of a Social Cognitive Theory-based Medication Adherence Intervention

Status: RECRUITING


Brief Summary:
The goal of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness and usability of a newly developed oral anticancer agent adherence program implemented across 6 cancer clinics (two academic, two urban, and two rural). The study will include 160 adult participants with either solid tumors or hematologic malignancies who have been taking oral anticancer agents for at least six months.

This study will have two groups of participants, a pre- and post-implementation group. In the pre-implementation of the program group, investigators will administer a survey to the 80 participants and gather information about their medication prior to their enrollment of the program. Similarly, 80 participants who have been enrolled into this program for at least 6 months will serve as the post-implementation group. These patients will be administered the same survey. The results from both groups will be analyzed to see how effective the medication adherence program is.


Detailed Description:
Participants enrolled in this adherence program will have individualized counseling sessions with their clinical pharmacists regarding their oral anticancer agent. The pharmacists will review with all their patients, information including proper administration, side effects, symptom management, and treatment plans. Participants will continue to have these counseling sessions with their pharmacists, until the patient becomes stable on the oral anticancer agent.

Once stable, the participant will be placed into one of three monitoring risk categories (low risk, medium risk, high risk), by the pharmacist, based on several factors. Each of the three monitor categories will have different monitoring intervals where patients will interact with the pharmacists differently. Additionally, each patient will have follow-up appointments and will have access to further education and will be reassessed each time. Furthermore, additional help will be provided to each patient based on their needs. Depending on the monitoring category, participants may meet with their pharmacist more and communicate either through electronic surveys or in-person visits.

Title: Liquid Micro-biopsy: a Novel Approach to Study Tumor Microenvironment From the Peripheral Blood

Status: ACTIVE_NOT_RECRUITING


Brief Summary:
This is a prospective multicentre, tissue-based, non-profit study that includes two enrolling centres: Operating Unit (OU) No. 1 of Haematology and OU No. 2 of Medical Oncology, both at the IRCCS Azienda Ospedaliera-Universitaria di Bologna (AOUBO). Given the rarity of the pathology investigated and the lack of evidence from the literature, the study should be considered exploratory, aimed at providing provisional evidence and generating hypotheses that could be tested in future studies.

The study involves the collection of peripheral blood samples from healthy volunteers (HD) matched for sex/age (n=30; Group 1) and patients with acute myeloid leukaemia at diagnosis (n=30; Group 2) at UO1 and patients with visceral sarcoma with measurable disease (n=30; Group 3) at UO2.

Specifically, peripheral blood (equal to 60 mL) from healthy volunteers will be collected after obtaining the signed informed consent of the volunteers of the Associazione Onlus AIL Bologna ODV.

From all participants in Groups 2 and 3, 60 mL of peripheral blood and 20 mL of bone marrow blood will be collected at routine clinical examinations. Bone biopsies (10 sections) will also be collected from Group 2 patients. All samples will be collected at the time of diagnosis (T0). All samples will be centralised at the Haematology Unit, IRCCS AOUBO and submitted for laboratory analysis.

For patients with acute myeloid leukaemia, responses to treatment will be assessed on the basis of standard criteria according to the recommendations of the European LeukemiaNet of 2022 (Döhner H et al, Blood 2022). Clinical response for sarcoma patients according to the international RECIST imaging criteria assessed by routine computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging scans.


Detailed Description:
Survival of AML is globally poor, with an overall survival at 5 years largely inferior to 50%. The diagnosis of several diseases, such as AML relies on invasive procedures. An increasing amount of evidence supports the straightforward relations between bone marrow (BM) biopsies and blood in hematological malignancies, including AML. Novel approaches to the characterization of TME have been developed. In this regard, scRNA-seq analysis emerged as a potent tool, capable of profoundly characterizing genomic profiles at the single-cell level. However, ST have the potential to improve our understanding of TME composition and cellular interactions, representing a powerful tool capable of identifying cell types and gene expression profiles on a structural and spatial level.

Since the question of a comprehensive characterization of tumor heterogeneity and cell-cell interactions is still unsolved, new ways to detect its modulation using blood are highly warranted for tumor diagnosing and monitoring."

Title: Peritoneal Recurrence Among pT4 Colon Cancer Tumors: Epidemiology, Oncologic Outcomes and Risk-stratification Model. Results From an Observational Retrospective Multicenter Long-term Follow-up Study

Status: COMPLETED


Brief Summary:
This is an observational retrospective cohort study to determine metachronous peritoneal carcinomatosis in a specific subgroup of colon cancer patients, those with a final pathologic exam corresponding to pT4 tumors.

Based on a sample size calculation of 1152 patients, a retrospective review of a three year period of every participant hospitals, 50 in total, of different characteristics, was stablished.

Demographic, clinical, operative, histologic and oncologic follow-up variables were recorded.


Detailed Description:
This is an observational retrospective cohort study to determine metachronous peritoneal carcinomatosis in a specific subgroup of colon cancer patients, those with a final pathologic exam corresponding to pT4 tumors.

A national multicenter retrospective cohort study is proposed. Given that the objectives of the study is to establish the prognostic oncologic impact of developing metachronous peritoneal carcinomatosis, it is intended to include patients who have completed three years of follow-up, therefore, the period of inclusion of patients to be analyzed is from 2015 to 2017.

Inclusion criteria:

* Patients operated on for colon cancer, considering those patients with neoplasia located from 15 cm from the anal margin in the proximal direction.
* Patients with histological confirmation of colon adenocarcinoma.
* Postoperative anatomical-pathological staging pT4a and pT4b.
* Patients operated both electively and urgently.
* Patients in whom a complete macroscopic resection of the primary tumor is achieved.

Exclusion criteria:

* Histological types other than adenocarcinoma, such as leiomyosarcomas, GIST, neuroendocrine tumors and other less frequent forms.
* Patients in whom the persistence of macroscopic oncological disease is described after the intervention on the primary tumor, considering it totally unresectable.

Definitions:

Definition of peritoneal carcinomatosis: presence of oncological disease at the peritoneal level, whether single or multifocal, and that is clearly recognizable and distinguishable from other forms of loco-regional recurrence of colon cancer such as anastomotic, mesenteric or lymph node recurrence and retroperitoneal form.

Definition of second look type surgery: it is considered all that programmed intervention carried out to rule out the presence of peritoneal carcinomatosis based on anatomo-pathological or clinical data related to the primary tumor and its debut form, but without the existence of clinical, analytical data or radiological during follow-up that allow it to be suspected."

Title: Impact of Exposure to Cosmetics on Sensitive Skin

Status: COMPLETED


Brief Summary:
The concept of sensitive or reactive skin was evoked in 1947 and developed in the 1970s and is now widely recognized. The international pruritus society has proposed an international consensus definition: sensitive skin is defined as a syndrome manifested by the occurrence of unpleasant sensations (tingling, burning, pain, pruritus, tingling) in response to stimuli that normally do not not cause such sensations. The triggering factors can be cosmetics, water, cold, heat, temperature variations, wind ... etc.

The physiopathological mechanisms are debated and several hypotheses exist. Sensitive skin can be considered as a decrease of the threshold of cutaneous tolerance. Sensitive skin is linked to abnormalities of the cutaneous nervous system, which becomes hyper-reactive. This hyperreactivity can be modulated by multiple factors. Exposure to cosmetics could be one of the main triggers for sensitive skin, especially for women. This can be explained by the wide use of cosmetics (in France women apply an average of 16 different cosmetics per day), by overconsumption of cosmetics, by exposure to potentially irritating ingredients. Sensitive skin would be less tolerant to the frequent and prolonged use of cosmetics. However, no precise information is available on the actual consumption of cosmetic products in the population with sensitive skin, in particular no data exists concerning the type of products used, the criteria of choice of products, the daily number of products used. and the ingredients contained in these cosmetics


Detailed Description:
Objectives are:

To compare the consumption of cosmetics qualitatively and quantitatively in a group of subjects with sensitive skin in the face and scalp, with a group of subjects with non-sensitive skin Study of triggers of sensitive skin Localization of sensitive skin in the face Resonance of sensitive skin Duration of onset of skin sensitivity after application of the cosmetic Use of organic products, formulated for sensitive skin, for children Shopping venues for cosmetics Advice from a professional for the purchase of cosmetics Impact of sensitive skin on the use of cosmetics Budget dedicated to the purchase of cosmetics

Title: Prospective Controlled Cohort Study on the Safety of a Monophasic Oral Contraceptive Containing Nomegestrol Acetate (2.5mg) and 17ß-estradiol (1.5mg)

Status: COMPLETED


Brief Summary:
This study compares the risks of short- and long-term use of NOMAC-E2 (containing a fixed dose of nomegestrol acetate and estradiol) compared with levonorgestrel-containing combined oral contraceptives (COC-LNG) in a study population representative of the actual users of the individual preparations.


Detailed Description:
NOMAC-E2 is a novel monophasic oral contraceptive containing a fixed dose of nomegestrol acetate (2.5mg) and 17ß-estradiol (1.5mg) which is taken for 24 days followed by 4 days of placebo. The most relevant adverse clinical outcome that has been linked to the use of COCs is venous thromboembolism (VTE). Data from randomized clinical trials did not show any serious health concerns for NOMAC-E2. However, the statistical power to detect rare adverse events is limited in these studies.

PRO-E2 is a large, prospective, controlled, long-term active surveillance study to investigate the safety of NOMAC-E2 with regard to the outcomes of interest. This study follows the European Active Surveillance (EURAS) design methodology with some modifications due to country- and product-specific characteristics.

Title: Comparison of Plaque Removal Efficacy of Powered and Manual Toothbrush Among Children With Cerebral Palsy

Status: UNKNOWN


Brief Summary:
CHildren of Cerebral Palsy(CP) are at high risk of developing dental diseases most commonly periodontitis and caries. Neuromuscular and psychological impact makes it difficult for the CP child to clean dental plaque from the surface of the teeth.inability to perform coordinated movements too makes brushing very difficult and hence it worsens the oral hygiene status.

Hence the objective of the study is to assess plaque removal efficacy of powered toothbrush versus manual toothbrush evaluated by improvement in oral hygiene status of patients with Cerebral Palsy CP children who meet inclusion exclusion criteria will be assessed at different time intervals via Oral hygiene index simplified (OHI-S), plaque index (PI) and gingival index (GI) Scores will be compared and analyzed from baseline, after first phase and after second phase of interventions.


Detailed Description:
Children with cerebral palsy manifests neurologically associated muscular dysfunction. They face difficulty in maintaining posture, gait and locomotion, leading to restricted movements. They are at a higher risk of developing dental diseases most commonly periodontitis and caries. Neuromuscular and psychological impact makes it difficult for the CP child to clean dental plaque from the surface of the teeth. The main cause of dental diseases in CP is ineffective removal of dental plaque. This is due to lack of motor and neuromuscular dysfunction with an inability to understand and comprehend oral hygiene instructions and unable to carryout well-coordinated movements for instance tooth brushing. In a disadvantaged population interventions should be introduced at an early phase of life encouraging it to become part of CP child's daily oral hygiene maintenance regime.

Hence the objective of the study was designed to assess plaque removal efficacy of powered toothbrush versus manual toothbrush evaluated by improvement in oral hygiene status of patients with Cerebral Palsy CP children who will meet the inclusion criteria will be assigned into two groups. Baseline debris, calculus and gingival and plaque status will be recorded using Oral Hygiene Index Simplified (OHI-S) and gingival \& plaque index (PI, GI). The group I will receive a conventional manual toothbrush and group II will be given powered toothbrush. After 4 weeks,will receive powered brush and group II will receive manual brush. After 4 weeks again the subjects will be assessed again for PI, GI, OHI-S. The scores will be compared and analyzed from baseline, after first phase and after second phase of interventions. Repeated measures two way ANOVA with Post Hoc Tukey test. Repeated measures two way ANOVA with Post Hoc Tukey test will be applied on mean GI, PI and OHI-S."

Title: Investigating the Effect of Glucagon on Cognitive Function and Cerebral Glucose Metabolism in Humans: A Pilot study_A

Status: RECRUITING


Brief Summary:
The aim of the study is to develop a non-invasive method for quantifying cerebral glucose metabolism by PET scans in humans. This method will be used in subsequent studies, where the effect of the pancreatic hormone glucagon on cerebral glucose metabolism will be studied.

The golden standard for quantifying cerebral glucose metabolism by PET scans is based on arterial blood sampling, which complicates research setup. This study will investigate if image derived measurements instead of arterial blood samples can be used to quantify cerebral glucose metabolism.

We will compare the calculations of cerebral glucose metabolism based on arterial blood samples and image derived measurements and hopefully these will correlate.

Healthy participants will be included, and each participant will participate in one study day, which includes intravenous administration of radioactively labelled glucose (18-FDG), arterial blood sampling and PET scans.


Detailed Description:
Participants will arrive after a four hour fast. An arterial cannulation will be placed in the radial or brachial artery for blood sampling. A venous catheter will be placed in the antecubital vein for administration of 18-FDG. Blood glucose is measured.

Before administration of 18-FDG a ""low dose"" CT scan of the heart and brain will be performed.

At time 0 minutes 20 MBq 18-FDG will be administered, 10 minutes automatic blood sampling (from the arterial cannulation) will be started and a 10 minutes three part dynamic PET scan of the heart will be performed.

Approximately at time 20 minutes 180 MBq 18-FDG will be administered and a 40 minutes three part dynamic PET scan of the brain will be performed. During the first 10 minutes of the brain scan automatic blood sampling (from the arterial cannulation) will be performed and thereafter manual blood sampling will be performed every 5 minutes.

After the 40 minutes brain PET scan a 5 min post scan of the heart will be performed.

Radioactivity will be measured in the arterial blood samples and the results will be used for an Arterial Input Function (AIF).

Radioactivity measurements derived from the heart scans will be used for an Image Derived Input Function (IDIF).

Title: Hyperventilation and Oxygenation to Increase Breath Hold in Breast Cancer Irradiation Treatment (HOBBIT) 3: Mental Exercises and Temporal Alteration

Status: COMPLETED


Brief Summary:
In the HOBBIT-trial by Vakaet et al. A protocol was developed to increase breath-hold time using (voluntary) hyperventilation and oxygenation to achieve DIBH times around 3 minutes.

Multiple non-medical interventions are being investigated to prolong a L-DIBH that are feasible in clinical practice. One of these methods will be to alter the time perception of the subjects. It has been noted in multiple studies (both medical and not) that slowing a person's perception of time results in an increase in breath-hold time. This alteration in time perception can be achieved with the use of a slowed clock as well as the usage of mental or physical exercises to preoccupy the subjects.

Volunteers will then be randomised into either the standard arm or the intervention arm. The intervention arm will follow standard protocol regarding DIBH preparation, though during the L-DIBH they will be asked to perform a simple mental exercise on a tablet. After 2 sessions of 3 L-DIBHs each, there will be a cross-over to the other arm in order to ascertain comfort and preference with each technique.


Detailed Description:
Adjuvant radiation therapy has a well-established role in the treatment of breast cancer complementing surgery and systemic treatment, improving survival and local control in both local and regional disease. The long-term follow-up, however, does show increased cardiac morbidity and mortality. The risk of heart disease is greatest in patients receiving a higher heart dosage i.e., left sided breast cancer and irradiation of the internal mammary lymph nodes and does not appear to have a threshold. Lowering heart dose can be achieved by improved planning methods as well as increasing the distance between the target volume and the heart. A deep inspiration breath-hold (DIBH) is often used to this end.

An unassisted DIBH is between 12 and 30 seconds; a simple breast irradiation averages 4 DIBHS for completion. More advanced radiotherapy plans (including lymph nodes) needs up to 20 DIBHs. This great amount is both physically and mentally exhausting.

A protocol was developed to increase breath-hold time using (voluntary) hyperventilation and oxygenation to achieve DIBH times around 3 minutes.

Multiple non-medical interventions are being investigated to prolong a L-DIBH that are feasible in clinical practice. One of these methods will be to alter the time perception of the subjects.

Title: A Phase I Study to Determine the Safety and Immunogenicity of Co-administration of the Candidate Influenza Vaccine MVA-NP+M1 and the Viroflu® Seasonal Influenza Vaccine

Status: TERMINATED


Brief Summary:
This is a single blinded placebo controlled phase I study, to assess the safety and immunogenicity of co-administration of the candidate influenza vaccine MVA-NP+M1 with the Viroflu® seasonal influenza vaccine. All volunteers recruited will be healthy adults aged 18 and over.


Detailed Description:
This study is designed to test the safety and effectiveness of a combination of two vaccines for influenza. One of these vaccines will be the seasonal influenza vaccine 'Viroflu' ('Inflexal V'). The second will be an investigational viral vectored vaccine called MVA NP+M1. The rationale for combining these two vaccines is that they work differently and that by combining the two vaccines, stronger and broader immune responses may be produced.

The MVA NP+M1 vaccine has been evaluated in five previous clinical trials. In total, over 80 volunteers have received this vaccine. There have been no vaccine related serious adverse events. Higher doses of MVA NP+M1 are more reactogenic, however at the dose to be used in this study the majority of adverse events are mild.

20 volunteers will be recruited in this study. They will all be adults over the age of 18. Volunteers will be assigned to one of two groups. Volunteers in group 1 will receive Viroflu, followed by a dose of MVA NP+M1. Volunteers in group 2 will receive Viroflu followed by a placebo injection (saline). Volunteers will be blinded so that they do not know which group they have been allocated to and will be asked to complete diary cards listing any adverse events after vaccination.

Vaccinations will be administered into the thigh as the deltoid muscle is not normally large enough to accept two intramuscular injections.

Volunteers will followed up for 6 months in total. Two days after vaccination they will receive a telephone call from one of the clinical team. They will then attend three follow up visits (at weeks 1, 3 and 26). At each visit, volunteers will have blood tests taken and will be questioned about any adverse events they may have experienced.


Eligibility Criteria:

Title: A Randomized Trial Comparing Surgical Treatments for Neuroma Pain in Amputees

Status: WITHDRAWN


Brief Summary:
Amputees often suffer from relentless pain and disability resulting from symptomatic neuromas within the amputation stumps. When conservative measures fail to address these symptoms, two contemporary surgical approaches to treat symptomatic neuromas have become the most popular. Targeted muscle reinnervation (TMR) is a procedure which involves transferring the injured proximal nerve stump into a terminal nerve branch entering muscle, such that the axons from the proximal nerve stump will regenerate into the muscle and thereby prevent neuroma recurrence. Regenerative peripheral nerve interfaces (RPNIs) are muscle grafts placed on the proximal nerve stumps that serve as targets for the regenerating axons from the proximal nerve stumps.

While TMR and RPNIs have demonstrated promise for the treatment of symptomatic neuromas, prospective comparative data comparing outcomes with these two approaches is lacking.

The investigators have recently developed a novel approach to treat symptomatic neuromas that provides vascularized, denervated muscle targets (VDMTs) for the axons regenerating from the severed proximal nerve stump to reinnervate. This is accomplished by islandizing a segment of muscle on its blood supply and ensuring complete denervation prior to implanting the neighboring transected nerve stump into this muscle. VDMTs offer theoretical benefits in comparison to RPNIs and TMR that the investigators also aim to test in the proposed study.

The investigators' objective is to enroll amputees with symptomatic neuromas into a prospective study in which amputees will be randomized to undergo TMR, RPNI, or VDMT and subsequently monitored for pain and disability for 1-year post-operatively. The investigators' specific aims are as follows: 1) Test the hypothesis that VDMTs are more effective than TMR and RPNIs with regards to treating pain and disability associated with symptomatic neuromas; 2) Provide the first level one, prospective data directly comparing the efficacy of TMR and RPNIs.


Detailed Description:
Extremity amputations are common operations both in the United States and other areas of the world. It is estimated that there are nearly 2 million adults living in the United States alone. Etiologies for extremity amputation are diverse but the most common indications include complications of type 2 diabetes, non-diabetic peripheral vascular disease, trauma, and oncologic conditions. Given the increasing prevalence of several of these pathologies, conservative estimates suggest that the population of people living with an amputated limb will likely double within the next several decades."

Title: Enhancing Trauma Resuscitation Through Arterial Line Integration: A Before-After Study

Status: ACTIVE_NOT_RECRUITING


Brief Summary:
Accident-related deaths is the 7th leading cause of death in Taiwan, and most of them is due to trauma from falls and traffic accident. Among trauma patients, the common cause of death is from hemorrhagic shock. Thus, real-time and accurate blood pressure monitoring is important for trauma patients. Incorrect blood pressure monitoring can lead to adverse events like traumatic cardiac arrest and shock and can also delay the time for intervention (fluid resuscitation, blood transfusion and operation). The current practice of blood pressure monitoring in trauma patient is by non-invasive blood pressure monitoring, which may be incorrect and not timely. Patient's body type and peripheral perfusion can both influence the result of non-invasive blood pressure monitoring.

With continuous and correct blood pressure monitoring, the resuscitation team can give adequate and timely treatment. In some trauma centers, arterial line insertion in trauma patients is a daily practice, while the evidence is inadequate and the potential benefit in unknown.

The main purpose of this study is to investigate the application of arterial line insertion in trauma patients. The study design is a prospective before-after study to exam whether arterial line insertion in trauma patients can reduce adverse event rate like hypovolemic shock and improve patient's outcomes.

Title: AMD3100 With Busulfan, Fludarabine and Thymoglobulin for Allogeneic Stem Cell Transplantation for Acute Myelogenous Leukemia and Myelodysplastic Syndromes

Status: WITHDRAWN


Brief Summary:
AMD3100 given in combination with busulfan, fludarabine (and thymoglobulin (ATG) for unrelated or HLA nonidentical donors) preparative regimen in patients with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) / myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS).

This study aims to determine if in AML and MDS patients there is a reduction of malignant cells and enhanced elimination of the leukemia as assessed by progression free survival. Secondary goals will be to assess effects on engraftment, graft versus host disease (GVHD) and immune reconstitution.


Detailed Description:
This is a single centre phase I/II study which will be conducted in two stages. The ability of AMD3100 to augment the antileukemic effect of chemotherapy and stem cell transplantation in patients with MDS or with AML in first or subsequent relapse, second or greater remission or primary induction failure will be assessed.

The primary objective in Stage 1 is to determine an acceptably safe dose, utilizing the continual reassessment method (CRM).The CRM is a model-based statistical procedure for conducting phase I clinical trials that assigns doses to successive cohorts of patients based on the doses given and outcomes observed (toxicity or no toxicity) of all previous patients. In this sense, the method is ""outcome-adaptive."" The CRM relies on a simple Bayesian model for the probability of toxicity as a function of dose. As the dose-toxicity data in the trial accumulate the Bayesian model ""learns"" about the relationship between dose and probability of toxicity. Numerous computer simulation studies (and the references therein) have shown that the CRM has greatly superior properties compared to conventional ""3+3"" algorithms. This is due to the facts that conventional algorithms are not model-based, they only use data from the most recent 6 patients, and they tend to stop the trial very early, with the consequences that they are very likely to give very unreliable estimates of the toxicity probability at each dose and provide an unreliable recommended maximum tolerated dose (MTD).

Under the particular version of the CRM being used in this trial, following treatment of the first cohort of three patients at the initial dose level 80 µg/kg, the following decisions are possible:

* If 0 of the first 3 patients (#1, 2 and 3) experience toxicity, then the method will escalate and the second cohort of patients (#4, 5 and 6) will be treated at the second dose level, 160 µg/kg.
* If either 1 or 2 of the first 3 patients experience toxicity, then the method will stay at the starting dose, so the second cohort will be treated at the lowest dose level, 80 µg/kg.
* If all 3 of the first 3 patients experience toxicity, then the posterior probability that the lowest dose is unacceptably toxic will be 0."

Title: Perinatal Thoraco-abdominal Tumors Management in Infants : a Multicenter Experience

Status: COMPLETED


Brief Summary:
Congenital tumors are a rare diagnosis in the fetus and newborn. They differ from those of children and adults in terms of the nature, location and evolution of the tumor.

Indeed, some histologically benign tumors may have lethal potential in utero (e.g. sacrococcygeal teratomas) or even undergo malignant transformation if left untreated. In contrast, other tumors that are malignant by histological criteria may have a very good prognosis, regressing spontaneously within the first year of life (e.g. neuroblastoma).

Despite advances in imaging, benign and malignant solid tumors remain a major diagnostic and prognostic challenge in the antenatal context.

The management of congenital tumors requires multidisciplinary expertise, taking into account the perinatal context, which poses specific problems, particularly in terms of therapeutic aspects, but also the frequent existence of associated malformations and/or genetic predisposition syndromes.

This study focuses on solid tumors of the thoraco-abdomino-pelvic region, the main objective being to investigate the correlation between antenatal clinical and radiological analysis and confirmed postnatal diagnosis of congenital solid truncal tumors, as well as the developmental spectrum in which they fit.


Detailed Description:
Congenital tumors are a rare diagnosis in the fetus and newborn. Despite advances in imaging techniques, it remains a major diagnostic and prognostic challenge. The congenital tumor differs from that of the child and adult in terms of tumoral nature, localization and evolution.

The investigation of a congenital tumor must be multidisciplinary and exhaustive, since it is estimated that congenital tumors are associated with a genetic predisposition syndrome in 10% to 15% of cases, and this proportion is set to rise in the coming years.

Precise analysis of the spectrum of tumors involved, and diagnosis of the nature of the tumor, are the basis for advice and pre- and post-natal care. Prenatal information given to parents must be accurate and precise, as the diagnosis of a congenital tumor may lead to a request for medical termination of pregnancy.

Diagnostic performance in the characterization of a tumor mass in antenatal care is still imperfect.

Diagnostic performance in the characterization of a tumor mass in antenatal care is still imperfect.

By reporting on our experience in the management of congenital tumors in the Ile-de-France region, we aim to improve our understanding of the developmental spectrum in which these tumors occur. By clarifying the diagnosis, the resulting management can be optimized and adapted to each situation. The challenge is to treat the tumor effectively and sustainably, while avoiding overly aggressive treatments when they are not indicated."

Title: Assessment of Adolescent Idiopathic Scoliosis Based on 3D Imaging Technology Using a Depth Camera

Status: RECRUITING


Brief Summary:
Adolescent Idiopathic Scoliosis (AIS) is a common spinal deformity affecting adolescent health, and early diagnosis and accurate assessment are crucial for preventing disease progression. Traditional assessment indicators, such as the trunk rotation angle (ATR) and Cobb angle, rely on clinical examinations and X-ray imaging, which have certain limitations, including radiation exposure and insufficient sensitivity. The Back Height Difference (BHD), as a quantitative measure of the back surface morphology, may reflect the degree of trunk deformity caused by scoliosis.

The use of the Kinect v2 depth camera to capture three-dimensional point cloud data of the back provides a high-precision, radiation-free assessment method.

Title: Dynamics of Insulin Absorption in Subclinical Lipohypertrophy Using the Euglycemic Clamp Technique

Status: WITHDRAWN


Brief Summary:
This study will use the euglycemic clamp technique to evaluate insulin absorption when insulin is administered subcutaneously in an area of subclinical lipohypertrophy vs an area of normal tissue.


Detailed Description:
The use of insulin to manage diabetes can cause changes to the skin at sites where insulin is administered. These changes may be felt as lumps under the skin. Insulin injected into these areas may not work as well leading to needing increasing doses of insulin to control blood glucose levels. Hypoglycemia can occur when insulin is injected into normal areas. Previous studies have found that these lipohypertrophic areas can be seen on ultrasound before they can be felt. The Investigators will be using the euglycemic clamp techique to evaluate insulin absorption to see whether tissue with lumps that cannot be felt but are seen on ultrasound affect how insulin is absorbed.

Title: Animal Assisted Intervention for Hemodialysis Outpatients: A Mixed-method Randomized Controlled Trial for Treatment Adherence and Psychosocial Well-being

Status: WITHDRAWN


Brief Summary:
The goal of this clinical trial is to understand if and how an animal-assisted intervention \[AAI\] using therapy dogs can support hemodialysis \[HD\] patients' treatment adherence and enhance their well-being. The main objectives are:

* Objective 1: Determine if the AAI impacts patients' HD treatment adherence (primary outcome is number of unplanned missed treatments no due to hospitalization).
* Objective 2: Evaluate if the AAI impacts patients' psychosocial well-being (secondary outcomes are stress, pain, mood, QOL).
* Objective 3: Examine potential mechanistic biomarkers that underpin human-animal bonding (hormones tied to stress and bonding). (exploratory aim)
* Objective 4: Understand patients' subjective experiences of the AAI.

Participants will be asked to engage in several research tasks, including:

* assessments
* therapy dog visits
* monthly blood draws
* focus group

Researchers will compare how the treatment group (those who receive 2 dogs visits per week) and the control group (those who receive 0 dog visits per week) to see if the AAI impacts treatment adherence and psychosocial well-being.


Detailed Description:
This study will take place in one outpatient dialysis clinic. The clinical trial will compare a standardized therapy dog interaction delivered twice weekly (based on pilot study outcomes detailed below) to usual care (e.g., no dog exposure) using a 1:1 randomized, 2-arm design. Subjective patient-reported outcomes \[PRO\] and routinely-tracked clinic data (e.g., missed visits) will be used. A total of 30 patients will be recruited then randomized 1:1 into 2 arms: control group with 0 dog visits (n = 15) and intervention group with 2 dog visits per week for 20 weeks (n = 15). The AAI is designed to promote patient comfort, uplift mood, and provide an opportunity for socialization. The nature of the dog interaction involves several different components, including but not limited to: petting the dog, talking to the dog, watching the dog do tricks, conversing with the dog handler, and being prompted to discuss any fond memories/stories of their own personal experiences with human-animal interactions. Regarding duration, the dog visits average 10 minutes but will be allowed to vary, and length of dog visits will be tracked. Each team (dog handler + dog) will have an assigned unique ID so that variation in dog is controlled for. This study will utilize trained certified dog handlers to deliver the intervention from reputable local and national pet therapy organizations. All dogs have gone through extensive training and behavioral assessment, will provide proper documentation, liability insurance, and vaccinations. All study procedures take place in the clinic waiting room."

Title: Anterior Vaginal Wall Reconstruction: Anterior Colporrhaphy Reinforced With Tension Free Vaginal Tape Underneath Bladder Base

Status: UNKNOWN


Brief Summary:
The purpose of this study is to assess the effectiveness of the polypropylene tape in preventing cystocele recurrence when placed underneath the bladder base as a concomitant measure to the anterior colporrhaphy procedure.


Detailed Description:
Objective: The purpose of this study is to assess the effectiveness of the polypropylene tape in preventing cystocele recurrence when placed underneath the bladder base as a concomitant measure to the anterior colporrhaphy procedure.

Methods: Fifty Caucasian women 50 to 77 years old (mean age 66.6 years), 2 pre and 48 post menopausal with stage II-IV pelvic organ prolapse, enrolled into the study. Vaginal reconstructive surgery included an anterior colporrhaphy in all patients, posterior colpoperineorrhaphy in 28 patients and hysterectomy in 36 patients. They were randomly divided in a control group of 22 women and a study group of 28 women. As reinforcement to the anterior colporrhaphy procedure a polypropylene tape (TVT-O) was placed not under the midurethra, as originally described in case of stress incontinence, but underneath the bladder base and was fixed there with polyglactin sutures, in the study group. The postoperative follow up was carried out in frequent intervals of 4 months (total 48 months). The assessment of the anatomic result included evaluation of the operated sites and of the position of the tapes inserted on clinical grounds and after perineal sonography, which measured the distance of the bladder base to the inferior edge of the symphysis pubis.

Results: In all patients the postoperative correction of the anterior vaginal wall was sufficient; the mean distance of the bladder base to the inferior edge of the symphysis pubis was 1.5 cm (range 1.0-2.2 cm). Mean residual urine volume was 30 ml. There were postoperatively 2 cases of stress incontinence and two cases of urge incontinence one in each group. There was no case of tape erosion noted, no dyspareunia and no recurrent cystocele in the study group. Four cases of recurrent cystocele (20%) were reported in our control group.

Conclusion: The tension free vaginal tape, particularly TVT-O, placed underneath the bladder base, when performed concomitantly to the anterior colporrhaphy appears to be safe and effective. While the preliminary results of our study are encouraging, larger series of patients and longer follow up are required to verify the effectiveness of the aforementioned modification.

Title: Development of An Exergame for Caregivers of Individuals With Alzheimer's Disease or Related Dementias

Status: COMPLETED


Brief Summary:
The study goal is to evaluate user experience with our developed exergame, which was designed to increase physical activity, exercise self-efficacy, and social connections among caregivers of individuals with Alzheimer's disease (AD) or related dementias. Participants will use this garden-themed exergame for six weeks. Tailoring an exergame for caregivers of AD or related dementias has the potential to increase physical activity and to improve overall health and well-being in this vulnerable population, which in turn can benefit the patients for whom they provide care. All study sessions be held at a location convenient to participants.


Detailed Description:
The number of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) caregivers providing informal care for family members is rising dramatically, and supportive programs are vitally needed. Caregivers of AD patients have relatively high levels of stress and depression and limited physical activity and social engagement. Technology-driven programs can offer engaging, sustainable, and scalable opportunities to give caregivers critically-needed supports for health and well- being. This pilot study uses cognitive behavioral methods to develop an innovative social exergame to increase physical and social activity among AD caregivers. Leveraging wearable activity monitors, physical activity data collected throughout the day and in varied settings will serve as input to the game experience.

Caregivers will assess the suitability of an exergame prototype with an array of features including (1) instructional exercise modules, (2) activity data visualizations, (3) digital rewards for physical activity that can be used to create virtual gardens, and (4) opportunities to connect virtually with other caregivers to share and comment on their creative products.

The aim of this study is to evaluate enjoyment of the exergame and its feasibility to increase moderate and vigorous physical activity, virtual social contact, and exercise self-efficacy. A group of approximately 20 caregivers will test the exergame for six weeks on an Android smartphone. The findings will be used to develop larger-scale intervention studies to test the efficacy of the exergame in the future. Tailoring an exergame for caregivers of AD has the potential to increase physical activity and to improve overall health and well-being in this vulnerable population, which in turn can benefit the Alzheimer's patients for whom they provide care.

All participants will be given a fitness tracker to keep after the study, a value of over $100! Participants will receive $5 Amazon Gift card each week upon completion of each weekly questionnaire. Participants can receive up to a $30 of Amazon Gift card upon completion of weekly questionnaire."

Title: Comparative Effects of Mulligan's Mobilization and Proprioceptive Neuromuscular Facilitation Technique on Pain and Disability in Patients With Sacroiliac Joint Dysfunction: A Randomised Controlled Trail

Status: UNKNOWN


Brief Summary:
This study will aim to compare the effects of mulligan mobilization and PNF on pain and disability with patients of SIJ dysfunction and will be helpful for clinical physiotherapist to choose more effective treatment protocol for patients as there are fewer researches on comparison of these techniques.


Detailed Description:
The sacroiliac joint dysfunction syndrome (SIJDS) is an ongoing controversial issue and an important source of low back pain (LBP). It has been emphasized in many studies that the pathologies of sacroiliac joint (SIJ) are a source of pain in the lumbar spine and hip region. The prevalence of SIJDS in patients with chronic mechanical LBP is between 15 and 30% SIJD is a condition in which pain arises from the sacroiliac joint and is caused by the abnormal movement of ilium around the sacrum and abnormal function of the SIJ structures, like ligaments, muscles, capsules. The prevalence of SIJP has been stated to be up to 75% in LBP patients.

Physiotherapy techniques are used to correct SIJ mal-alignment manually by restoring the normal function and balance of lumbar and pelvic muscles and ligaments. Mulligan described the positional fault theory in which articular mal-alignment leads to altered kinematics and eventual dysfunction(2). Proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation (PNF) is a form of flexibility exercises used to resolve muscle shortening and strain.

Title: Comparison of the Analgesic Effect Between Ultrasound-Guided Serratus Anterior Plane Block and Intercostal Nerve Block After Single Port Video-Assisted Thoracoscopic Surgery in Primary Spontaneous Pneumothorax

Status: UNKNOWN


Brief Summary:
A prospective randomized controlled study was undertaken to compare the postoperative analgesic effect between ultrasound-guided serratus anterior plane block and intercostal nerve block after single port video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery with primary spontaneous pneumothorax.


Detailed Description:
Post-thoracotomy pain is one of the most notorious postsurgical pains that one can experience. The pain is known to last for an extensive period of time with significantly high intensity.

In field of thoracic surgery, video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery has been played an important role in alleviating the postoperative pain. Furthermore, single-port thoracoscopic surgery, which reduces the number of surgical incision, is increasingly carried out by many institutions world widely.

In field of anesthesiology, various attempts to alleviate post-thoracotomy pain have been tried along advancement of thoracic surgical techniques. It began with postoperative medication of non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs, opioids and progressed into implementations such as local analgesia, thoracic epidural block, paravertebral block, intercostal nerve block, interpleural block and serratus anterior plane block.

Many analgesic methods have been applied to alleviate postoperative pain in patients who have undergone thoracoscopic surgeries. However, there are no prospective randomized controlled studies between intercostal nerve block and serratus anterior plane block in single port video-assisted thoracoscopic surgeries. The main purpose of this study is to compare and analyze the effects between conventional intercostal nerve block and newly introduced serratus anterior plane block in primary spontaneous pneumothorax patients who have undergone single port video-assisted thoracoscopic wedge resection. This prospective study will discover the efficacy and differences between two methods.

Title: Protocol for the Treatment of Extracranial Germ Cell Tumours in Children and Adolescents (GC III)

Status: UNKNOWN


Brief Summary:
RATIONALE: Sometimes, after surgery, the tumor may not need additional treatment until it progresses. In this case, observation may be sufficient. Drugs used in chemotherapy work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Giving more than one drug (combination chemotherapy) may kill more tumor cells. Giving combination chemotherapy after surgery may kill any remaining tumor cells.

PURPOSE: This phase III trial is studying how well observation and/or combination chemotherapy works after surgery or biopsy in treating young patients with extracranial germ cell tumors.


Detailed Description:
OBJECTIVES:

* Stratify and reduce treatment for pediatric patients with extracranial germ cell tumors while maintaining event-free survival.
* Treat newly diagnosed patients with extracranial germ cell tumors requiring chemotherapy with a carboplatin-based strategy.
* Develop a common strategy for the treatment of patients with recurrent or progressive extracranial germ cell tumors.
* Register all cases of mature and immature teratoma.
* Develop a common strategy for the management of immature and mature teratoma, including follow-up strategies to permit early detection of yolk sac recurrence.

OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

Patients who have not had prior biopsy or surgical resection undergo biopsy (if feasible) or surgical resection. Patients with mature or immature teratoma undergo observation. These patients who relapse (i.e., tumor regrowth) may undergo further surgical resection unless tumor markers are significantly elevated. If the tumor markers are significantly elevated, these patients proceed to JEB chemotherapy according to risk group. Patients with all other malignant germ cell tumors are assigned to 1 of 3 treatment groups according to risk.

* Low-risk group: Patients with normal tumor markers undergo observation. Patients with rising tumor markers only AND no imageable tumor proceed to treatment as in the intermediate-risk group. Patients with rising tumor markers AND/OR imageable tumor are considered to have relapsed and proceed to treatment as in the intermediate- or high-risk group.
* Intermediate-risk group: Patients receive JEB chemotherapy comprising etoposide IV over 4 hours on days 1-3, carboplatin IV over 1 hour on day 2, and bleomycin IV over 30 minutes on day 3. Treatment repeats every 21 days for 4 courses. Patients with residual tumors after completion of chemotherapy may undergo second-look surgery.
* High-risk group: Patients receive JEB chemotherapy as in the intermediate-risk group for 6 courses. Patients with residual tumors after completion of chemotherapy may undergo second-look surgery."

Title: The Effectiveness of Low Frequency Comprehensive Physiotherapy Combined With Home Exercise on Joint Health, Frequency of Hemartrosis, Dynamic Balance and Reaction Time in Hemophilic Arthropthy

Status: COMPLETED


Brief Summary:
This randomised controlled study was conducted to investigate the comprehensive physiotherapy combined with home exercises on individuals with hemophilic arthropathy in the lower extremity. There are two groups in the study: home exercises and comprehensive physiotherapy combined with home exercises. Is physiotherapy combined with home exercises superior to home exercises on joint health, bleeding frequency, reaction time, dynamic balance, muscle strength? The aim of this study is to increase the compliance of hemophilic individuals to physiotherapy and adapt home exercises to their lives with weekly sessions.


Detailed Description:
Introduction: The positive effects of physiotherapy and exercise on joint health, frequency of hemartrosis (FoH) in patient with hemophilic arhropathy (PwHA) are well explained in the literature. However, adaptation problems to physiotherapy sessions (usually 3 times a week) may cause PwHA to ignore the need for therapy. It may be more beneficial for PwHA to adapt physiotherapy and exercise into daily live.

Aim: To investigate the effect of a once-a-week physiotherapy combined with home exercises on joint health, FoH, muscle strength, pain, reaction time and dynamic balance.

Methods: 20 patients have hemophilic arthropathy in knee and/or ankle were randomly divided into 2 groups, named home exercise (HE) and comprehensive physiotherapy combined with home exercise (CPcwHE). In the clinical assessment, HJHS, manuel muscle tester, Fitlight® system for reaction time, functional reach test for dynamic balance were used and questioned the number of bleedings in the last 6 weeks for FoH. The CP group received comprehensive physiotherapy (manual therapy, neuromuscular electrical stimulation and exercises) 1 day a week, and did the exercises at home the other 2 days a week. The HE group performed the exercises given to CP at home 3 times a week. Evaluations were repeated at the end of 6 weeks.

Title: Effects of Pulsatile Insulin Delivery on Peripheral Diabetic Neuropathy

Status: TERMINATED


Brief Summary:
Diabetic neuropathy is a progressive complication causing serious problems in 25-40% of diabetic patients. Anecdotal reports have indicated improvement with pulsatile IV insulin in patients otherwise resistant to all conventional therapies. Significant complications produce painful peripheral dysesthesias, loss of sensation and gastroparesis. This study is designed to test the effectiveness of pulsatile insulin delivery on diabetic neuropathy.


Detailed Description:
Diabetic neuropathy (DN) is a progressive complication causing serious problems in 25%-40% of diabetic patients. Significant complications produce painful peripheral dysesthesias, loss of sensation, and gastroparesis. DN may affect the peripheral motor and sensory nerves in addition to the autonomic nervous system (1-3). Treatment strategies for patients with DN have generally concentrated on pain relief, without addressing the underlying pathophysiology of the disease (4). Anecdotal reports from patients treated with pulsatile insulin for other complications suggest that this treatment may show efficacy in patients with DN. This study is designed to compare patients with DN who receive pulsatile insulin with a control group.

Pulses of IV insulin encourages the glucose metabolism in diabetics to normalize in multiple organs, especially muscle, retina, liver, kidney and nerve endings. The process fundamentally requires the administration of high dose insulin pulses similar to those found in non diabetic humans by their pancreas into the surrounding portal circulation. Oral carbohydrates are given simultaneously to augment the process and prevent hypoglycemia. The process is monitored by frequent measuring of glucose levels and respiratory quotients (RQ). RQ is measured by a metabolic cart which determines the ratio VCO2/ VO2. This ratio is specific for the fuel used at any one time by the body. The glucose levels are monitored to keep glucose levels appropriate and the RQ determines the need to readjust the infusion protocol in each patient for subsequent insulin infusion sessions. The insulin pulses are delivered over 1-hour periods with a 1-hour rest period between each session. Three treatments are given during each treatment day.

The respiratory quotient (RQ) is a measurement of CO2 exhaled and O2 inhaled and is proportionate to the fuel sources being used by the body, primarily the liver over short periods of time. The higher the RQ, the more glucose and less alternative fuel sources are being utilized. Following the RQ change helps determine the effectiveness of physiological insulin administration in increasing anabolic functions in diabetic individuals. By improving the body's glucose metabolism and thereby causing beneficial effects of anabolic factors, the possibility of serious complications can be decreased."

Title: Applying a New Method for Pain Control in Intrauterine Device Insertion

Status: RECRUITING


Brief Summary:
The goal of this clinical trial is to learn if use of topical benzocaine prior to the injection of lidocaine is effective in decreasing pain experienced during IUD insertion in patients 18 or older. The main question it aims to answer is:

Does topical use of benzocaine prior to lidocaine injection during IUD insertion effectively decrease pain experienced?

Researchers will compare benzocaine/lidocaine to benzocaine/placebo, placebo/lidocaine, and placebo/placebo to see if use of benzocaine prior to lidocaine injection works more effectively to decrease pain experienced rather than lidocaine, benzocaine, or placebo use alone.

Participants will:

* Arrive to clinic for previously scheduled IUD insertion
* Be screened, approached by research staff, and consented to join the trial
* Complete a demographic questionnaire
* Be randomly and blindly assigned to one of four groups
* Placebo/Placebo
* Placebo/Lidocaine
* Benzocaine/Placebo
* Benzocaine/Lidocaine
* All groups will be given 600mg of ibuprofen prior to procedure
* Be asked to rate their pain on a visual scale of 1-10 during several distinct points of the procedure.
* Be sent an optional survey to their email after the procedure


Detailed Description:
The goal of the researchers is to determine if use of a topical benzocaine spray prior to lidocaine injection will cause a significant reduction in pain experienced by patients undergoing an IUD insertion. Participants will be screened, approached, and fully consented by research staff in the clinic prior to their IUD insertion. Demographics will be gathered from all participants through a questionnaire. All participants will be given 600mg of ibuprofen prior to the procedure, but will be randomized into one of 4 groups as to what interventions/placebos they will receive during their insertion. Interventions studied are benzocaine spray and lidocaine injection. Placebos will be saline spray and paracervical needle stick without injection. Participants will be asked to rate their pain on a visual scale of 1-10 at the following timepoints during the procedure:

* At the time of tenaculum placement
* At the time of uterine sounding
* At the time of IUD insertion and deployment
* Immediately after removal of instrumentation
* 15 minutes after the procedure Participants who provided an email will be sent an additional questionnaire to be responded to within 24 hours of the procedure. At the conclusion of the trial statistical analysis will be done to determine significance of pain reduction varying between the 4 groups."

Title: Effect of Metformin Plus Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitors Compared With Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitors Alone for Patients With Advanced Non-small Cell Lung Cancer and EGFR Mutations: Phase 3 Randomized Clinical Trial

Status: UNKNOWN


Brief Summary:
Lung cancer represents the most frequent neoplastic disease worldwide, with an annual incidence of over 2 million cases, which represents 11.6% of all cancer diagnoses. Further, it constitutes the main cause of cancer-related deaths. Among the lung cancer types, non-small cell lung cancer represents 80-85% of cases, and the majority of patients are diagnosed with locally advanced or metastatic disease, and 5-year survival rates remain discouraging in most world regions, ranging from 8-18%.

Advances in molecular biology have led to the discovery of several molecular targets and development of targeted therapy for patients with specific molecular subtypes of NSCLC. One of the most widely studied is the epidermic growth factor receptor (EGFR), which has been long recognized as a key modulator for specific tumor cell functions, and thus it has been used in drug development strategies.

Mutations in the EGFR gene are reported in 15% of all NSCLC cases, though incidence varies widely and in Mexico up to 34% of patients present with tumors with EGFR mutations. Treatment of patients with tumors with these characteristics is based on specific tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), achieving higher objective response rates and improved progression-free survival (PFS) compared with chemotherapy-based schemes. Nonetheless, despite the initial response, most patients treated with TKIs will eventually develop resistance mechanisms and present progressive disease. Consequently, the development of novel strategies to overcome TKI resistance and improve PFS of patients with NSCLC with epidermic growth factor receptor mutations (EGFRm) is priority.

Up to 30% of patients with NSCLC present with somatic mutations in the liver kinase B1 (LKB1) gene, which acts as a tumor suppressor through inhibition of mammilian target of rapamycin (mTOR). In a study which included 24 patients with LKB1 expression who received treatment with metformin + TKIs, overall survival was improved significantly, and therefore it is important to evaluate LKB1 expression in addition to mutations which could be related with treatment response in patients given metformin plus antineoplastic agents. LKB1 can activate AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling through specific phosphorylations at aminoacid residues. AMPK can regulate cell cycle, cell proliferation and cell survival in NSCLC. Recently, the loss of expression of LKB1 has been associated with a reduced activation in AMPK using in vivo models, and increase in tumor necrosis after treatment with bevacizumab."

Title: Effectiveness of Environmental Therapy in Patients With Alzheimer's Disease

Status: COMPLETED


Brief Summary:
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most frequent form of dementia, causing high level of disability with elevated social costs. Alternative solutions to the standard pharmacological therapies have been studied in order to reduce the use of medications that frequently generates side effects and worsen patients' quality of life. A recent alternative treatment for AD is the Environmental Ecological Therapy (EET) that, with the use of therapeutic gardens, seems to reduce behavioral disorders (BD). However, the effectiveness of this approach is still mater of debate. Therefore, the aim of this trial will be to analyze the effects of EET, in people with severe AD.


Detailed Description:
Since Homo sapiens evolved in a natural environment, an intrinsic physiologic and psychological positive reaction to nature has been developed. Accordingly, emerging literature highlights the positive effect of therapeutic gardens, as environmental ecological therapy (EET) on the reduction of behavioral disorders (BD) and the preservation of cognitive functions in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD).

Despite these promising preliminary studies, limited data are available on the effectiveness of EET in individuals with advanced AD. Therefore, the aim of the current trial will be to evaluate the effectiveness of EET on AD symptoms in patients with advanced AD.

Participants with advanced AD will be selected from among residents of the Alzheimer's care units of the Mons. Mazzali Foundation (Mantua, Italy). Selected participants will be randomly assigned to a treatment group (TR), or to a control group (CTRL).

Participants assigned to TR group will perform a program of EET for 2 hours a day, 5 days a week for a total of 6 months. Individuals assigned to the CTRL group will be treated with a standard therapy.

Title: Holter and ECG Changes After Trancatheter Closure Of ASD In Children

Status: COMPLETED


Brief Summary:
Atrial septal defects (ASD) account for 10% of all congenital heart defects . Hemodynamic consequences of an ASD are dilatation of the right atrium and right ventricle (RV) because of the volume overload due to the left-to-right shunt through the ASD.For several decades, surgical closure has been considered the standard method of repairing a secundum ASD . Surgical repair, albeit enjoying a high success rate, negligible mortality, and good long-term outcome, is associated with morbidity, discomfort, and thoracotomy scars. That is why the transcatheter closure of the ASD has more recently become an alternative to the surgical procedure . During the last decade , ASD device closure , has finally replaced surgical ASD repair in most patients as the standard method of repair for the secundum ASD Cardiac arrhythmias and right chamber enlargement are well known long-term sequelae of atrial septal defect (ASD) . Therefore, many authors suggest ASD closure before adulthood . Classical ECG findings for a significant ASD are prolongation of the PR interval, prolongation of the QRS duration and right axis deviation of the QRS .

Percutaneous ASD closure is an ideal situation to study changes of RV dimensions and their impact on ECG as interferences from cardiopulmonary bypass, cardiac incisions and sutures on the right atrium and on the interatrial septum are excluded

Appropriate statistical methods were used in the analysis of the data.


Detailed Description:
Traditional learning methods and environments are thought to be insufficient to respond to the differing expectations of generation z, who were born and raised in a digital age. For this reason, it has become mandatory for educational institutions to renew their curricula and support them with advanced technologies. All over the world, higher education programs are trying to expand their educational capacities by applying innovative strategies to meet the future workforce needs. Nursing educators also report that fundamental changes in existing curricula are necessary for innovation. Since nursing is a profession that requires the acquisition of cognitive, psychomotor and attitudinal behaviors, it is important to use innovative practices in education. While these applications increase the attention of the student, they save the education from monotony and ensure the permanence of the education by ensuring the active participation of the student. Due to the fact that today is the age of technology, the use and development of new learning tools has increased at every stage of the nursing education process. These developments in technology and education have brought together these two fields and the use of simulation applications used to increase technical and non-technical skills in nursing education has become widespread."

Title: RANDOMİZED,DOUBLE-BLİND TRİAL OF EFFECT OF DEXMEDETOMİDİNE AND MİDAZOLAM SEDATİON ON HEART RATE VARİABİLİTY AFTER CORONARY ARTERY BYPASS GRAFT SURGERY

Status: UNKNOWN


Brief Summary:
The parasympathetic tone reduction and sympathetic tone enhancement, which are components of the autonomic nervous system (ANS) activity, increase the likelihood of malignant arrhythmias leading to ventricular fibrillation. Malignant arrhythmias are associated with high mortality and morbidity after coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgeries. Heart rate variability (HRV) is a physiological indicator of the effects of ANS activity on heart rate and is associated with a prognostic value for cardiac mortality. Dexmedetomidine has been shown to improve myocardial perfusion, reduce arrhythmia incidence, reduce inflammatory response, and reduce mortality in patients with coronary artery disease. The aim of this study investigate the effects of dexmedetomidine electrophysiologically on cardiac autonomic system by using HRV analysis for the purpose of sedation in patients who were followed up in the intensive care unit after coronary artery bypass graft surgery


Detailed Description:
Malignant arrhythmias are associated with high mortality and morbidity after coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) operations. Heart rate variability (HRV) is a physiological indicator of the effects of activity on heart ANS rate and has prognostic value for cardiac mortality. Spectral analysis of HRV can provide an assessment of adrenergic and cholinergic system activities during anesthesia. With the ""power spectral"" analysis of HRV, important clinical information can be obtained about the effects of anesthesia on the autonomic nervous system and the central nervous system. Decrease in HRV has a prognostic value for cardiac-induced mortality. The disease, which is transferred to intensive care unit (ICU) after CABG, is sedated with different medicines until the time of extubation. One commonly used sedative drug is deksmedetomidine, an α2 receptor agonist. Alpha 2 (α2) receptor agonist drugs reduce myocardial oxygen consumption and heart rate with sympatholytic properties. Therefore, deksmedetomidine can be safely and effectively used in patients undergoing cardiac surgery without pro-tachyarrhythmic and / or negative inotropic effects.In this study, it was aimed to investigate electrophysiologic effects of cardiac autonomic system by using HRV analysis in dexmedetomine and midazolam patients who underwent elective CABG and were used for sedation in the postoperative period.

Title: Efficacy of Suvorexant in Patients With Effectively Treated Restless Legs Syndrome and Persistent Chronic Insomnia: A Randomized Placebo-Controlled Crossover Trial

Status: COMPLETED


Brief Summary:
The investigators aim to determine the effect of suvorexant on actigraphically-derived total sleep time in patients with effectively treated restless legs syndrome with persistent insomnia in a two-arm, double-blind, randomized placebo-controlled crossover 2.5-month trial.


Detailed Description:
Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS) is a sensory-motor neurological disorder characterized by an irresistible urge to move the legs. Persistent difficulties with all phases of sleep are common in patients whose RLS symptoms are resolved with treatment. Multiple potential causes for treatment-refractory sleep disturbance exist, including activating effects of dopamine agonists (which are first-line RLS treatments), conditioned insomnia and poor sleep habits as a result of chronic RLS-related sleep disturbance, and comorbid medical and psychiatric illness. Suvorexant provides an important therapeutic option to treat insomnia in the context of RLS. It has demonstrated long-term efficacy, particularly in shortening the duration of nocturnal awakenings and increasing total sleep time. Similarly, it has a comparatively benign side effect profile compared to many other agents typically prescribed to treat insomnia. The investigators aim to determine the effect of suvorexant on actigraphically-derived total sleep time, as well as actigraphically-derived wake after sleep onset, Insomnia Severity Index score, subjective sleep endpoints, and RLS symptom severity.

Title: Do Women Receiving Low Dose Combined Spinal Epidural for Labor Analgesia Exhibit Less Bacteriuria Using a Urinary Retention Protocol Versus Routine Urinary Catheter Placement?

Status: TERMINATED


Brief Summary:
The investigators hypothesize that many parturients can, in fact, spontaneously micturate with low dose combined spinal epidural analgesic doses given for labor and that Foley catheterization is unnecessary in the majority of these parturients. At Prentice Women's Hospital, almost 9000 women annually receive neuraxial labor analgesia and 98% of those receive Foley catheters. By potentially reducing the necessity for Foley catheters, the investigators should be able to ultimately reduce the rate of bacteriuria, urinary tract infections and urethritis leading to unnecessary treatment with antibiotics, as well as reduce costs of placing unnecessary Foley catheter.The hypothesis is parturients receiving low dose combined spinal epidural analgesia for analgesia after induction of labor who are randomized to a spontaneous micturition protocol will require fewer Foley catheter placements and demonstrate a lower incidence of positive urine culture postpartum than those who undergo standard Foley catheter placement.


Detailed Description:
Participation in the study will begin at the patient's request for labor analgesia. The patient will be asked to urinate and a post void residual (PVR) will be measured via ultrasonography. If the PVR is \>100mL, the patient will be excluded from the study. If CSF is not obtained during CSE placement or the CSE technique is abandoned for any other reason, the patient will be excluded. If the PVR is \< 100mL and the combined spinal epidural analgesia is successful, they will be randomized to receive either routine Foley catheter placement or begin the spontaneous micturition protocol. Last cervical exam and VRS pain will be recorded at this time.

Subjects will be prepared in the usual fashion for the combined spinal epidural with hemodynamic monitoring and intravenous (IV) access.

The anesthesiologist will perform a combined spinal epidural analgesia per routine with the subject in the sitting position using sterile technique at the L3-4 interspace (± one vertebral interspace). The epidural space will be found using loss of resistance technique with either 3 mL of air or saline and a 17G Touhy needle. After the epidural space is identified, the dura will be punctured with a 27G Pencan and 2.5mg of plain bupivacaine + 15 μg fentanyl will be injected. The epidural catheter will be inserted to 3-5cm into the epidural space and a test dose of 3 mL of 1.5% lidocaine + 1:200,000 epinephrine will be injected. The epidural catheter will be secured and the PCEA initiated with the standard infusion rate and patient administered boluses using 0.06% bupivacaine + 2mcg/mL fentanyl. Post-procedure vital signs will be monitored in the usual fashion."

Title: The Investigation of the Effect of Kinesiology Taping on Lumbar Region Structures and Balance in Transfemoral Amputees

Status: COMPLETED


Brief Summary:
With the initiation of prosthesis use following lower extremity amputations, the body shows biomechanical changes according to the amputation level, and as a result, it develops adaptation mechanisms on both the healthy and ampute sides. It has been reported that the most common secondary pathology caused by these mechanisms developed to compensate the amputated side is lower back pain and adaptation mechanisms vary according to the presence of pain. Adaptation strategies in transfemoral amputees cause permanent changes in the connective tissue structure properties of the toracolumbar region and reduce the contribution of these structures to dynamic stability. It has been reported that with the fascia correction technique, one of the kinesiological taping techniques, the connective tissue fiber alignment can be rearranged and the degree of stiffness can be reduced. Before the intervention, biomechanical properties of the toracolumbar region structures with MyotonPro and postural stability measurements with TekScan will be taken.

Title: Multi-spectral Imaging to Assess Wounds in Peripheral Vascular Disease Patients

Status: UNKNOWN


Brief Summary:
Peripheral vascular disease (PVD) is a common disease of impaired blood flow resulting in the compromised tissue perfusion of lower limbs. PAD patients can experience pain, diminished exercise capacity, and tissue loss, with some ultimately requiring amputation. The economic burden of PVD is significant. In the United States alone, PVD accounts for over $20 billion in annual healthcare related costs.

The demand for the development of an effective method to characterize the viability of PVD wounds has resulted in the emergence of several innovative techniques. Commonly used diagnostic methods are ankle-brachial index (ABI), pulse volume recordings, duplex ultrasonography, venous plethysmography, Transcutaneous oxygen tension (TcPO2), toe pressures, angiography by X-ray, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging. Currently, angiography remains the diagnostic gold standard. However, many of these techniques lack the ability to triage and adequately determine the viability of the wound. In addition, there remains a need for effective triage technologies to help clinicians decide whether surgical management is needed. Early determination of surgical versus conservative management may help to improve patient functional outcomes, reduce mortality rates, and prevent limb amputation.

Near-infrared point spectroscopy (NIRS) is a non-invasively technology with recent applications in PVD wound assessment. To date, studies have demonstrated the validity of NIRS technology in patients with peripheral arterial disease. NIRS measures flow, concentration, and oxygenation of hemoglobin in arterioles, capillaries, and venules several centimeters deep in tissue. The MSID is an evolution of existing NIRS imaging devices and has become a portable and functional commercial device produced by KENT imaging (Calgary, Canada). Using this new and clinically applicable NIRS technology designed for assessing wound perfusion and oxygenation, this study seeks to adequately identify viable from non-viable wounds and to rapidly determine indication for vascular interventions. This technology is well-suited for use in a wound patient population as the measurements times are short and can quickly be used at the patient bed side. As such, this project intends to apply NIR technology to quickly assess PVD in the investigators' patient population.

Peripheral vascular disease (PVD) is a common disease of the elderly, resulting in the compromise of blood flow to the lower limbs. As a consequence of impaired tissue perfusion, PAD patients can experience pain, diminished exercise capacity, and tissue loss, with some ultimately requiring amputation."

Title: An Evaluation of the Immunological Parameters Associated With a Skin-Test and Immunization of Lung and Mesothelioma Cancer Patients With Autologous Lung Tumor Associated Antigen: Characterization of the Patients' Cytolytic and Helper T Cell Reactivity for Identification of the Specific Antigen(s): A Pilot Study

Status: COMPLETED


Brief Summary:
RATIONALE: Vaccines made from a person's tumor may help the body build an immune response to kill tumor cells.

PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of vaccine therapy in treating patients who have undergone surgery to remove stage I, stage II, or stage IIIA non-small cell lung cancer or stage I or stage II mesothelioma.


Detailed Description:
OBJECTIVES: I. Define the immunological parameters of cytolytic T cell and T helper cell activity associated with skin testing and vaccination with autologous lung tumor associated antigen and detoxPC in patients with curatively resected stage I, II, or IIIA non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) or stage I or II mesothelioma. II. Evaluate any responses associated with an enhanced antitumor immune status in this patient population with this treatment regimen.

OUTLINE: Patients undergo delayed type hypersensitivity skin testing with autologous tumor associated antigen (TAA) and memory antigens (i.e., Monilia, PPD, and Trichophyton) intradermally at 1-4 weeks following surgical tumor resection. At week 4-9, patients receive low dose cyclophosphamide IV once. At 3 days following chemotherapy, patients receive autologous TAA with DetoxPC intradermally for up to 3 doses over 4 weeks.

Title: Micro-EMG: A Novel Multi-electrode System for Intramuscular Imaging of Human Motor Units

Status: RECRUITING


Brief Summary:
The purpose of this small-scale exploratory study is to bridge the knowledge gap between the bench testing and the design of potential future confirmative studies. Identifying and evaluating MicroEMG measurement parameters in this exploratory manner is a necessary step to evaluate its usability and design, and determine whether the microEMG system may be suitable for in-house use after further confirmative testing.


Detailed Description:
About this study We have developed a completely new multi-electrode electromyography system (MicroEMG) that we want to test in this study. It records muscle activity from multiple recording points in the muscle at once. We believe that this will increase the sensitivity of the technique in diagnosing muscle disease, reduce the time taken, and be more comfortable for patients. However, to prove whether this is the case we first need to understand the how the recorded signals of the new MicroEMG look like in different patient groups.

Background:

Why are we doing this study?

Electromyography (EMG) is an essential diagnostic test for nerve and muscle diseases. Cells in the muscle generate electric potentials when they are activated. This activity can be measured by the EMG. Based on those 'patterns', experts can detect medical abnormalities, such as muscle or nerve disorders. EMG involves inserting a thin metal needle electrode through the skin into a muscle. It records changes in the pattern of electrical signals produced by the muscle fibres. In conventional EMG only a single recording surface at the tip of the needle is used and therefore only small part of muscle can be examined.

We developed a new EMG device called MicroEMG. It uses a novel type of electrode that can examine the muscle in more detail. As it records activity from several different points at the muscle at once it can produce an electrical image (rather than an abstract signal). This way a large volume of muscle can be recorded simultaneously with less movement and discomfort for the patient.

What is the goal of this study?

Patients with a disease known to affect the nerves or the muscles typically would be tested with conventional EMG. Some diseases are linked to a specific 'diagnostic pattern' in the EMG that guides the specialist's diagnosis.

We do not know these pattern for MicroEMG yet. In this study we want to look at how measurements with the new MicroEMG look like in patients with neuromuscular disease. Each patient will undergo recordings from identical muscles using both conventional EMG and microEMG during a single visit. This will allow us to relate the electrical signal patterns in the muscle measured by MicroEMG to the known diagnostic pattern we typically see in conventional EMG. We will do this in both healthy and diseased muscles."

Title: The DUTRENEO Trial: A Prospective Study to Individualize the Approach With DUrvalumab (MEDI4736) and TREmelimumab in NEOadjuvant Bladder Cancer Patients.

Status: COMPLETED


Brief Summary:
In the treatment of localized/locally advanced urothelial cancer, there are several questions that have not yet been resolved, such as the limited benefit of cisplatin-based chemotherapy in the adjuvant or neoadjuvant context, the difficulty in establishing which groups actually benefit from either perioperative treatment and what are the molecular markers that could help us predict the response to this treatment to allow a better selection of patients. On the other hand, not all patients are candidates for cisplatin-based chemotherapy and carboplatin is not comparable in activity, so there is an urgent need to find other drugs that may offer a therapeutic opportunity to these patients.

In the context of metastatic disease, immunotherapy has been able to modify the natural history of this disease, administered as monotherapy, but the combination with double immune checkpoint inhibitors is also being evaluated with promising results. Even this therapeutic strategy is being advanced to the context of adjuvant and neoadjuvant treatment of urothelial tumors. In this sense, on the one hand, the present study, as a research in the neoadjuvant setting, constitutes the opportunity to define molecular phenotypes in bladder cancer since the design of this study will allow both, to evaluate the efficacy of the drug when the tumor is operable and to carry out an extensive analysis of biomarkers in the tumor tissue of these patients with an in-vivo evaluation of immune-based therapy activity. On the other hand, it allows to evaluate a strategy of double-immune checkpoint inhibitors that has already demonstrated activity in metastatic disease and, taking into account, the modest benefit of standard chemotherapy in the perioperative context: platinum-based neoadjuvant chemotherapy in patients with muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC) Modest increase in overall survival, but only a subset of eligible patients are eligible to receive it. In addition, radical cystectomy alone, in MIBC patients, presents a 5-year relapse rate of 10-50%.


Eligibility Criteria:
Inclusion Criteria:

1. Male and female subjects; age ≥ 18 years at the time of study entry.
2. Subjects must provide written informed consent prior to performance of any protocol-related procedures, including screening evaluations and must be willing to comply with treatment and follow up.

Title: Evaluation Of The Pharmacokinetics Of Antithrombin III In Neonates And Infants Undergoing CPB And ECMO Support

Status: COMPLETED


Brief Summary:
The potential role of ATIII in achieving and maintaining adequate anticoagulation in pediatric patients on the heart-lung machine has recently taken on increased importance as caregivers strive to mitigate the risk for clinically significant clotting problems. It is known that ATIII levels are decreased in normal neonates and infants less than 6 months of age relative to older children and adults and become even further decreased in critically ill neonates and infants, including those with congenital heart disease. The current utilization of ATIII in the context of support on a heart-lung machine is based on pharmacokinetic data derived from adult subjects with congenital ATIII deficiency. There is a gap in knowledge as to the appropriate frequency of ATIII repletion, best method of monitoring, and mode of administration in critically ill neonates and infants receiving support on a heart-lung machine.Our long-term goal is to determine if antithrombin (ATIII) can effectively change the coagulation system in patients undergoing heart-lung machine support. The objective of this proposal, which is our first step in pursuit of that goal, is to determine the pharmacokinetics of ATIII in neonates and infants. Our central hypothesis is that ATIII will have different pharmacokinetic properties in neonates and infants than adults and these properties will be affected by the use of heart-lung machine.

This research will result in critical data on the pharmacokinetics of ATIII in neonates and infants receiving heart-lung machine support. This contribution is significant because it is the first step in a continuum of research that is expected to lead to the development of a therapeutic strategy employing ATIII that will facilitate improved modulation of the coagulation cascade to prevent significant clotting and bleeding complications in pediatric patients requiring heart-lung machine support.


Detailed Description:
This is a single-site, prospective, open-label, pharmacokinetic study of hpATIII in neonates and infants. Patients admitted to the Cardiac Intensive Care Unit (CICU) and the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) at Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center (CCHMC) will be enrolled. Participants will be enrolled into one of three cohorts depending on whether they are scheduled for ECMO, CPB, or neither, and based on age (neonate or infant).

Two doses of hpATIII will be used; one according to current labelling for hpATIII and one that accounts for the additional circuit volume from ECMO or CPB. Pharmacokinetic measurements will be obtained for all groups at baseline prior to administration of hpATIII and at multiple defined times up to 120 hrs following each administration of hpATIII.

Administration of hpATIII is standard of care at CCHMC for participants undergoing ECMO."

Title: Non-Invasive Ventilation Versus Continuous Positive Airway Pressure in Cardiogenic Pulmonary Edema: a Multicentre Study

Status: COMPLETED


Brief Summary:
Non-invasive ventilation (NIV) has become now a widely used treatment modality in ICU and emergency services to deal with respiratory failure.1 NIV has the potential to improve ventilatory assistance while avoiding endotracheal intubation and its complications.

Since the first publications of Meduri2 and Brochard3 the number of studies on the NIV has been growing and developing and this technique becomes one of the major progress in the field of respiratory assistance. Decompensation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is certainly the least questionable indication of the NIV. However, indication of the NIV is inexorably spreading to other types of acute respiratory insufficiency, including acute cardiogenic pulmonary edema (CPE).4 Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) is the most currently used non-invasive ventilation usually performed without the use of a ventilator. NIV using pressure support (NIPSV) combined pressure support (inspiratory aid) and positive expiratory pressure as in CPAP. Based on physiological ground, NIPSV would be more performant than CPAP to improve ventilatory parameters and reduce the work breathing in APE. However, this issue is not settled yet. Number of meta-analysis over the last 2 years were devoted to the comparison of CPAP and NISPV,5 so that the scientific evidence is still far from established. In addition, it is not sur that patients enrolled in these studies are representative of all patients with APE. The fact that they were included solely on the basis of clinical criteria, the risk of overlap with other diagnoses is not negligible. Thus the use of markers of heart failure as the BNP (brain natriuretic peptide) would be very useful. On the other hand, the possible deleterious effect of NIPSV on myocardial perfusion is a problem that has not been definitively resolved.

Objectives of the study:

1. Compare the efficacy and safety of the NIPSV with those of CPAP in patients presenting to the emergency department with CPE.
2. Compare the two procedures in subgroups of patients with hypercapnia and high BNP concentration.


Detailed Description:
Cardiogenic pulmonary edema is defined as an increase of hydrostatic pressure in the pulmonary microcirculation resulting from postcapillaire hypertension.

The direct consequence is extravasation of fluid in the alveolar and interstitial tissue, leading to acute hypoxemia and a decrease in lung compliance. The decrease in lung compliance, increased airway resistance (interstitial and bronchial edema) and hypoxemia will cause an increase in work of breathing."

Title: Gewinnung, Kultur Und Studien Von primären Humanen Zelltypen, Geweben Und Blut für Die Gezielte Behandlung Von Seltenen Hauterkrankungen

Status: UNKNOWN


Brief Summary:
Rare skin diseases are generally defined as serious life-threatening, progressive chronic diseases of the skin that occur extremely rarely (i.e., 5 in 10,000 people are affected). More than 80% are hereditary. In most cases, late diagnosis and the lack of therapeutic strategies also contribute to severe disease progression. Therefore, new therapeutic options are urgently needed and with them knowledge of the underlying mechanisms of disease development.

The aim of this project is to better understand disease mechanisms and to identify new pathways and drug targets that will improve patient care or therapy. In order to investigate the mechanisms of disease development, it is necessary to isolate biological material, i.e. blood and affected skin tissue from patients. For this purpose, adults 18 years of age and older with a congenital rare skin disease are included. We take blood and (lesional) skin biopsies from patients to perform immunoprofiling, as well as cell biological studies with the patient's cells. The risk for the patients is low, as only peripheral blood and skin biopsies are taken. Potential risks include bruising and pain as well as infection, postoperative bleeding, wound infection or delayed wound healing, pain, and scarring.

The samples are pseudonymized and stored with the pseudonym only. Cells and skin samples are only preserved with the prior consent of the patient.

Title: A Three-part Study of Eltrombopag in Thrombocytopenic Subjects With Myelodysplastic Syndromes or Acute Myeloid Leukemia (Part 1: Open-label, Part 2: Randomized, Double-blind, Part 3: Extension)

Status: COMPLETED


Brief Summary:
This was a worldwide, three-part (Part 1: open-label, Part 2: randomized, double-blind, Part 3: extension), multi-center study to evaluate the effect of eltrombopag in subjects with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) or acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who have thrombocytopenia due to bone marrow insufficiency from their underlying disease or prior chemotherapy. This objective was assessed by a composite primary endpoint that consists of the following: the proportion of ≥Grade 3 hemorrhagic adverse events, or platelet counts \<10 Gi/L, or platelet transfusions. Patients with MDS or AML and Grade 4 thrombocytopenia due to bone marrow insufficiency from their underlying disease or prior chemotherapy were enrolled in the study. No low or intermediate-1 risk MDS subjects were enrolled in the study. Subjects must have had at least one of the following during the 4 weeks prior to enrolment: platelet count \<10 Gi/L, platelet transfusion, or symptomatic hemorrhagic event. Supportive standard of care (SOC), including hydroxyurea, was allowed as indicated by local practice throughout the study. The study had 3 sequential parts. Subjects who were enrolled in Part 1 (open-label) cannot be enrolled in Part 2 of the study (randomized, double-blind); however, subjects who completed the treatment period for Part 1 or Part 2 (8 and 12 weeks, respectively) continued in Part 3 (extension) if the investigator determined that the subject was receiving clinical benefit on treatment.


Eligibility Criteria:
Inclusion Criteria:

* Adult subjects (18 years of age or older) with MDS or AML (bone marrow blasts ≤50%) with thrombocytopenia due to bone marrow insufficiency from the disease or prior treatment. Subjects with transient thrombocytopenia due to active treatment with disease modifying agents or chemotherapy (except for hydroxyurea) are excluded.
* Subjects must have Grade 4 thrombocytopenia (platelet counts \<25 Gi/L) due to bone marrow insufficiency (or Grade 4 thrombocytopenia, but platelet count greater than or equal to 25 Gi/L due to platelet transfusion). In addition, subjects must have had at least one of the following during the 4 week screening period: platelet transfusion, or symptomatic bleeding or platelet count \<10 Gi/L. Subjects whose thrombocytopenia below 10 Gi/L is due to causes other than bone marrow insufficiency (e.g., fever, infection, autoimmune disease) are not eligible.
* Subjects must have platelet count, bleeding and platelet transfusion data available over a period of at least 4 weeks prior to randomization."

Status: COMPLETED


Brief Summary:
The objective of this clinical trial was to assess the efficacy and safety of cetirizine HCl syrup vs. loratadine syrup vs. placebo syrup in the treatment of SAR in children 6 to 11 years old.


Detailed Description:
This was a multi-center, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled, double dummy study of children with SAR conducted during the Spring tree and grass allergy season. Subjects qualified for randomization if the diary cards included (1) symptom scores of ≥2 for at least 2 of the following 4 rhinoconjunctivitis symptoms on 4 or more days: sneezing, runny nose, itchy eyes, and watery eyes; and (2) a total rhinoconjunctivitis (or Total Symptom Severity Complex \[TSSC\]) score of ≥5 on any 4 days. The TSSC score was expressed as the sum of the 4 individual symptoms scores recorded in the daily diary cards for the following symptoms: sneezing, runny nose, itchy eyes, and watery eyes.

Subjects were randomized to receive 1 of 3 treatments in a double-blind fashion using a 1:1:1 allocation ratio: cetirizine HCl syrup and placebo loratadine syrup; loratadine syrup and placebo cetirizine HCl syrup; or cetirizine placebo syrup and loratadine placebo syrup.

Number of Subjects (Planned and Analyzed): 1100 planned; 1536 screened; 683 randomized: 231 (33.8%) randomized to the cetirizine HCl treatment group, 221 (32.4%) to the loratadine treatment group, and 231 (33.8%) to the placebo treatment group.

Test Product and Reference Therapy: Subjects randomized to receive cetirizine HCl syrup also received placebo syrup; subjects randomized to receive loratadine syrup also received placebo syrup; and both placebo syrups were received by subjects randomized to receive placebo.

Duration of Double-Blind Treatment: 2 weeks.

Safety measures included the incidence and severity of treatment-emergent adverse events (AEs), vital signs, concomitant medications, and physical examination findings. Clinical laboratory evaluation was not required for this study.

Statistical Methods: All statistical tests related to treatment effect were 2-sided, and statistical significance was declared at the 0.05 probability level. Least squares means (LSMeans) were used to estimate treatment effect. Populations analyzed included the Full Analysis (intent-to-treat \[ITT\]) Set (FAS), Per-Protocol Set (PPS), Safety-Analyzable Set, and All-Screened Analysis Set. Demographic and baseline data for all subjects in the Safety-Analyzable Set were summarized and listed. The effects of treatment at the Overall and all other analysis Time Points were assessed using ANCOVA models."

Title: Deconstructing the Atopic March - the Role of Filaggrin Mutations and Sensitization Pathways in Allergic Rhinitis and Peanut Allergy

Status: ACTIVE_NOT_RECRUITING


Brief Summary:
Caucasian male and female participants age 18 years of age and older will be enrolled in this study if they have known birch or peanut allergies or known to be non-atopic. Participants will undergo skin testing to confirm their allergies if not completed in the last 12 months. Medications and medical history will be captured with a focus on atopic disorders. Participants will undergo birch and peanut patch testing to assess penetration and if potential correlation exists with filaggrin genotyping and phenotyping. Blood samples will be drawn from participants and DNA isolated for genotyping of null mutations in filaggrin.


Detailed Description:
Participants with confirmed history of birch induced allergic rhinitis or peanut allergy or that are non-atopic will undergo the following procedures.

If not already completed in the previous year, participants will be skin tested to a panel of common environmental allergens, including birch pollen and peanut. To be considered ""non-atopic"", all skin tests in the panel must be negative in the presence of a positive histamine control. All participants will also be skin tested to peanut, Arah 2, Ara h 8 (if obtainable), crushed raw unroasted peanut, peanut butter, peanut extract, Bet v 1 and birch pollen extract.

Blood samples will be drawn for genotyping of the four most common null mutations in FLG in Caucasians (R501X, 2282del4, R2447X, S3247X).

Patch testing will be performed using Ara h2, Arah8 (if obtainable), crushed raw unroasted peanut, peanut butter, peanut extract, Bet v 1 and birch pollen extract. Peanut and birch pollen allergens, both whole and components will be diluted 1:10 in both saline and petroleum jelly and applied to normal controls skin to establish levels for irritant reaction. If further dilutions are required to show non-irritation these will be performed.

As well, a limited medical history and medication history will be documented, with a focus on atopic disorders (i.e. atopic dermatitis (eczema), allergic rhinitis, asthma, and food allergy). Those in the non-allergic control group will be excluded if they have features of eczema, food allergy or other atopic conditions). Medications that could potentially interfere with the skin test results (i.e. antihistamines) must be documented, and appropriate washout intervals observed prior to the skin test procedure, if necessary."

Brief Summary:
The aim goal of this study is to compare the duration of induction and labor between outpatient and inpatient care in low-risk pregnant women.

The secondary objectives are to compare between the two groups the maternal satisfaction from induction to delivery, the maternal and neonatal morbidity and mortality, impact on service organization and a medico-economic evaluation (cost-consequence analysis) from a collective perspective and with a time horizon of one month For women who do not agree to take part in the randomized study, an observational study will be proposed to them in order to collect the reason for their refusal and their maternal satisfaction.

Researchers will compare the return home with conventional hospitalization

Patients presenting with a singleton pregnancy and with an indication for induction of labor will be proposed to participate in the study.

If the pregnant woman refuses to participate in the randomized study, she will be invited to take part in the observational study.

For women who accept, a fetal heart rate recording (FHRR) is made prior to balloon insertion. If there is no fetal heart rhythm abnormality (FHR), the double balloon catheter is inserted by a midwife. A further ERCF is performed to ensure that the procedure is well tolerated.

In the absence of metrorrhagia, fetal heart rate abnormalities, rupture of the water sac or uterine hypertonia/hyperkinesia, the patient will then be randomized to either the in-patient or out-patient arm. The patient will either be placed in a room or go home.

In both cases, the balloon will be removed after 24 hours in hospital in the absence of spontaneous labor, and the patient will be referred to the delivery room for water breakage and/or oxytocin infusion for induction.

Title: Phase II Studies of Two Different Schedules and Two Different Doses of the Farnesyl Transferase Inhibitor R115777 (Tipifarnib, Zarnestra®, NSC-702818) for Previously Untreated Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) in Patients of Age 70 or Older

Status: COMPLETED


Brief Summary:
This randomized phase II trial is studying 4 different tipifarnib regimens to compare how well they work in treating older patients with acute myeloid leukemia. Tipifarnib may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking the enzymes necessary for their growth


Detailed Description:
PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

I. To test whether any or all of four different regimens of R115777 (tipifarnib) is sufficiently effective therapy for previously untreated acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in patients of age 70 or older to warrant Phase III investigation. Additionally, to allow increased access for patients to an agent that appears promising in this patient population.

II. To estimate the frequency and severity of toxicities of these regimens in this group of patients.

III. To investigate in a preliminary manner the relationship of cytogenetics with response to R115777 (tipifarnib) and assess whether karyotype represents a potential prognostic factor among older AML patients who are not candidates for chemotherapy and are treated with R1157777.

IV. To collect specimens for future correlations (e.g. RAS and downstream targets) to be identified at a later date.

OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are randomized to 1 of 4 treatment arms.

ARM I: Patients receive oral tipifarnib twice daily on days 1-21. ARM II: Patients receive oral tipifarnib twice daily on days 1-7 and 15-21. ARM III: Patients receive tipifarnib as in arm I, but at a lower dose. ARM IV: Patients receive tipifarnib as in arm II, but at a lower dose.

In all arms, courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or disease progression. Patients who achieve a complete remission (CR) receive up to 3 additional courses beyond CR. Patients in CR who develop recurrent disease after the completion of therapy are eligible to receive tipifarnib again.

Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year, every 6 months for 1 year, and then annually for 3 years.

Title: Conception of an ICF Core Set for Systemic Sclerosis

Status: COMPLETED


Brief Summary:
The purpose of this study is to create and validate an ICF core Set for Systemic sclerosis


Detailed Description:
In 2002 was published WHO's International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF). ICF defines disability as ""the negative aspects of the interaction between an individual (with a health condition) and that individual's contextual factors (personal and environmental factors)"". Interactions are specified in five domains, classified from body, individual and societal perspectives by means of two lists: a list of body functions and structure, and a list of domains of activity and participation. Since an individual's functioning and disability occurs in a context, the ICF also includes a list of environmental factors.

ICF core sets, which are short lists of ICF categories relevant for specific conditions, serve as practical tools for clinical practice and allow standardisation of data for health information and research. Core sets have already been developed and validated for several musculoskeletal diseases, such as low back pain, osteoarthritis, or osteoporosis, but not yet for systemic sclerosis.

Status: COMPLETED


Brief Summary:
Dolutegravir (DTG, GSK1349572) is an integrase inhibitor that is currently in Phase 3 clinical development for the treatment of HIV infection. As HIV-infected subjects may also be receiving methadone for opioid dependence, an evaluation of the potential interaction between DTG and methadone is warranted. The primary objective of this study is to determine whether concomitant administration of DTG can affect the pharmacokinetics (PK) of methadone. As a secondary endpoint, the PK of DTG will be compared to historical data. This study will be open-label with subjects receiving DTG and stable doses of methadone. The study will be conducted at one center in Canada in adult male and female subjects.


Detailed Description:
The study is an open label methadone- doltegravir (DTG, GSK1349572) drug interaction study consist of 2 periods. Subjects must be opiate-dependent and are HIV sero-negative and are on stable dose of methadone 14 days prior to pre-screening. After meeting all eligible criterions, subjects will remain on their individual methadone dose for 3 days in period 1. In period 2, subjects will continue on their individual stable dose of methadone and will receive 50 mg DTG every 12 hours for 5 days. Pharmacokinetics will be collected on Day 3 of period 1 and Day 5 of period 2. Safety measurements will be routine chemistry, haematology and urinalysis. Pharmacodynamic parameters for pupillometry and opioid symptom questionnaire will be collected at the same timepoints as for the pharmacokinetics. Subjects will be discharged after the last PK sample has been collected. A follow-up visit will occur 7-14 days after the last dose of study drug. This study will be conducted at one centre in Canada.

Title: Effect of Oral Phloroglucin (Flospan®) as Premedication of Non-sedative Diagnostic Esophagogastroduodenoscopy: Single Center, Prospective, Double Blinded, Randomized Controlled Trial

Status: COMPLETED


Brief Summary:
Gastric peristalsis, which occurs during the endoscopic procedure, limits the visual inspection of the inspection field, causing interference in the inspection. The actual endoscopic examination is most commonly used by injecting Hyoscine butylbromide(Buscopan®), Cimetropium bromide (Algiron ®) into intravenous or muscular injection so it is not suitable for patients who undergo non-sedative esophagogastroduodenoscopy. In addition, these drugs were reported the side effects including thirst, dysuria, transient visual filed defect, tachycardia, anxiety so were not recommended for benign prostate hyperplasia, glaucoma, old age patients. For comfort and succesfull test, anti-spasmodics which don't have anti-cholinergic effect and are possible to take orally is necessary. Phloroglucin(Flospan®) is a smooth muscle relaxant that is currently used in the anti-spasmodic treatment without anticholinergic action so it can be administered in patients with glaucoma or BPH. Also it is suitable for endoscopic premedication due to transparent liquid component. Therefore, in this study, we would like to confirm the efficacy and safety of Phloroglucin (Flospan ®), which can be taken orally, as an pre-medication for non-sedative endoscopy.

Gastric peristalsis, which occurs during the endoscopic procedure, limits the visual filed of the inspection, causing interference in the inspection. The actual endoscopic examination is most commonly used by injecting Hyoscine butylbromide(Buscopan®), Cimetropium bromide (Algiron ®) into intravenous or muscular injection so it is not suitable for patients who undergo non-sedative endoscopy because intravenous assessment is unnecessary. In addition, these drugs were reported the side effects including thirst, dysuria, transient visual filed defect, tachycardia, anxiety so were not recommended for patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia, glaucoma, old age. Actually patients who undergo non-sedative endoscopy are used to perform examinations without using anti-spasmodics. In this case, gastric peristalsis restricts endoscopist's visibility and making accurate observation and prolonged inspection time increases patient's discomfort. For comfort and successfull test, anti-spasmodics which don't have anti-cholinergic effect and are possible to take orally is necessary. Phloroglucin(Flospan®) prompts to release norepinephrine by impeding catecholamine O-methyl transferase enzymes in visceral smooth muscle, so it works to control spasm by normalizing smooth muscle movement which was accelerated by acetylcholine."

Title: Breath Metabolomics of Placebo Effects Via Cold Pressor Test

Status: COMPLETED


Brief Summary:
This study is to analyze the breath metabolome before and after the administration of a placebo in an established experimental pain procedure in healthy subjects in order to investigate placebo effects, and whether they induce any measurable changes at the metabolic level.


Detailed Description:
Interrogation of the exhaled breath metabolome will be performed by using an objective method of measurement for placebo effects in pain analgesia, known as Cold Pressure Test (CPT). CPT reactions can be measured objectively by blood pressure spikes as well as changes in continuous heart rate monitoring.To this end, probands will be continuously connected to a Heartrate \& Blood Pressure Monitor. First, baseline exhalation will be assessed. Then, the CPT is performed according to the 'CPT Guide' with subsequent post-pain exhalations analysis with or without self-administration of the placebo (NaCl nasal spray). After 15 minutes rest, probands will be submitted to a second post-pain exhalations set (+/- placebo). The process is completely non-invasive as the participant just exhales through a commercially available disposable bacterial/viral filter coupled to the ion source.


Eligibility Criteria:
Inclusion Criteria:

* Healthy female and male adult volunteers
* German speaking, or good knowledge of the German language
* Able to understand the study
* Able to give informed consent

Title: Expanded Hemodialysis Versus Online Hemodiafiltration: a Pilot Study on Intradialytic Hemodynamics and Fluid Status

Status: COMPLETED


Brief Summary:
Conventional hemodialysis (HD) is essential for the treatment of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients, by reducing serum concentration of uremic toxins and correcting fluid overload.

Nevertheless, HD removes almost exclusively low-range uremic toxins. Therefore, medium-range molecules, such as beta-2-microglobulin might accumulate in tissues, leading to many clinical complications, such as neuropathies, tendinopathies, anemia, bone mineral disease and reduced growth in children.

Convective methods might reduce incidence of these complications, by removing molecules of medium-range molecular weight. Online hemodiafiltration (olHDF) is the most extensively used method in this regard. Nevertheless, there are some barriers to the wider introduction of this method in clinical practice, since specific machines are needed for this procedure, the costs with dialysis lines are higher and water consumption increases. More recently, the development of new membranes for hemodialysis allowed removal of medium- and high-range uremic toxins, with albumin retention. Thus, they allow removal of a broad range of uremic toxins, without changing dialysis machine or increasing water consumption. Such therapy is known as expanded hemodialysis (HDx).

The aim of this present study is to compare the extraction of middle-size molecules, the hemodynamic behavior, fluid and nutritional status of patients submitted to olHDF or HDx, in a crossover study.


Detailed Description:
Hypothesis

Our hypothesis is that HDx is noninferior to olHDF in the following parameters:

* Hemodynamic stability
* Nutritional and fluid status
* Removal of beta-2 microglobulin

Objectives To evaluate each patient, through a prospective, randomized and cross-over study, the intradialytic hemodynamic behavior, fluid and nutritional status assessed by electrical bioimpedance and B2M removal in two dialytic modalities: HDFol versus HDx.

Concise methods

1. Clinical and laboratorial data Clinical data will be collected from the institution's chart, recorded and filled with all necessary precautions to keep confidentiality of patient's information. They are: baseline renal disease, age, history of smoking, sedentary lifestyle, presence of comorbidities such as hypertension and diabetes mellitus, family history of cardiovascular disease, history of coronary and cerebrovascular disease and medications.

   Laboratory tests used to determine the biochemical, hematological and bone mineral profile characteristics will be obtained from routinely collected exams. Such exams are processed by the Central Laboratory of Hospital das Clínicas / FMUSP.
2. Dialysis All dialysis procedures will be performed by the Dialog+ Admea™ machine (BBraun Melsungen AG, Germany)."

Title: Role of Fibroblast Growth Factor 21(FGF21) in Breast Cancer

Status: NOT_YET_RECRUITING


Brief Summary:
The present study aims to evaluate the serum level of FGF-21 in patients with breast cancer and its correlation with clinical, laboratory, and pathological data.


Detailed Description:
Breast cancer is the most common malignant tumor in women, accounting for about 30 %, and its mortality rate is15 % of the incidence rate.

Studies in recent years have shown that the incidence of breast cancer is increasing year by year, which seriously affects Women's quality of life.

Several hormonal. metabolic and inflammatory mechanisms are known to play a role in the development and progression of breast cancer.

Fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) is a protein produced mainly in the liver and regulated by diseases.The elucidation of the endocrine FGF21 signaling pathways in the control of metabolic disease, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-α (PPAR-α) which functions in lipid metabolism. However, more data support a versatile role for this molecule acting as a physiologic alert system in several energy homeostasis and their complications has raised great interest and hope in the last year.

Cancer-associated fibroblasts are activated fibroblasts that serve as a key component of the tumor receptors. FGFR1 is often overexpressed in breast and lung cancer, Promoter hypermethylation correlates microenvironment; FGF-19, FGF-21 and FGF-23 are endocrine FGFs that bind to Klotho and FGF with poorer survival of patients.

Clearly, further studies are needed to elucidate the mechanisms behind the increased serum FGF21 levels a high FGF21 secretion by the liver and also by the tumor cells or the stress caused by microenvironment condition that induces an increased FGF21 secretion by mainly the hepatocytes or/and adipocytes in less in cancer patients. It is believed that the elevated FGF21 levels observed in these patients could be due to metabolic disorders. Alternatively, the initiation of the tumor itself could be considered as a stressful degree. A study shows that Circulating FGF-21 level is associated with increased risk of early and late stages of (11)Another study shows that FGF21 is useful as a diagnostic as well as prognostic factor in patients with colorectal carcinogenesis ,supporting a role of inflammation and metabolism atall stages of colorectal carcinogenesis, and suggesting potential use of this biomarker for risk stratification in CRCscreening. endometrioid endometrial carcinoma.

The role of FGF21 in breast cancer and its level is not adequatelyincluded however a study byRanuncolo etal., revealed increased serum level as well astissue expression level of FGF21 in breast cancer.

Title: Dose Higher Doses of Botulinum Toxin Show Better Intensity and Duration in the Treatment of Gummy Smile

Status: COMPLETED


Brief Summary:
Botulinum type A (BTX-A) is an easy and efficacious treatment for gingival smile (GS). However, the necessary for higher-doses among patients are controversial. The objective was to compare the reduction of gingival exposure using two methods in patients with different dosage. In this prospective self-controlled study, healthy GS participates who had an anterior gingival exposure (GE) of more than 3 mm were enrolled and administered with 2-5 U BTX-A (total, 4-10 U) injections into 1-2 points according to the severity presented pretreatment in the Average-dose Method. And after 8 months, the Higher-doses Method was administered the same point injection of 3-10 U BTX-A (total, 6-20 U). Data were collected at baseline and 4, 12, 32 and 60 weeks of follow-up.


Detailed Description:
The smile is one of the universal facial expressions of humans. Gingival smile is characterized by gingival exposure of \>3 mm upon smiling. The degree of gingival exposure can vary substantially between patients, with patients presenting gingival exposure of up to more than 10 mm. The prevalence of gingival smile is 10.57%, and it is more frequently observed in females. Although gingival smile is merely an anatomical variation, it can be considered unattractive, causing significant distress and impacting one's quality of life. Moreover, most orthodontists and dentists regard gingival smile as an important risk factor for dental treatment.

Gingival smile involves a complex interaction between the facial muscles, bone, and skin; specifically, it is related to hypermobility of the upper lip with muscle involvement and alterations in anatomical features, such as a short clinical dental crown, anterior dentoalveolar extrusion, maxillary excess, and a short upper lip. Therapies for gingival smile range from botulinum toxin injections to surgical interventions according to its etiology. Although the outcomes of surgical procedures are long-lasting, botulinum toxin type A treatment is an easy and fast outpatient procedure that requires no downtime and has high efficacy rates. Nevertheless, there are controversies around the optimal dose and injection site of botulinum toxin type A. Moreover, the efficiency of botulinum toxin type A for gingival smile varies markedly between studies, with the improvement rate of gingival exposure ranging from 62.06% to 98%. Sucupira and Abramovitz advocate the use of a low amount of botulinum toxin type A of 1.95 U per side for the treatment of gingival smile. They noted an average satisfaction level of 9.75 on a 10-point scale with this approach. They claimed that higher doses does not provide further benefit, and, in fact, could lead to lip ptosis, asymmetry, and excessive upper lip length."

Title: Use of the Equimolar Mixture of Oxide Nitrous and Oxygen (EMONO) Associated With Audiovisuals During Peripheral Venous Access Insertion of Children Between 2-5 Years Old Children

Status: COMPLETED


Brief Summary:
Children experience numerous painful experiences from nursing procedures: peripheral venous access placement is the main cause of procedural pain.

As much as pharmacological and nonpharmacological tools are known, their application during venipuncture is not systematic by children's hospitals.

Among pharmacological tools, the Equimolar Mixture of Nitrogen Protoxide and Oxygen (EMONO) provides adequate protection from procedural pain through inhalation of the gas mixture at least 3 minutes before the procedure.

Literature reports that the combination of nonpharmacological distractive tools and pharmacological interventions increases their analgesic effect.

Title: The Effect of Mindfulness-Based Web-Based Stress Reduction Program Applied to Primigravidas on Perceived Stress Level in Pregnancy, Birth Self-Efficacy and Prenatal Attachment

Status: NOT_YET_RECRUITING


Brief Summary:
The aim of this study is to investigate the effect of a mindfulness-based web-based stress reduction program applied to primigravidas on perceived stress level in pregnancy, birth self-efficacy and prenatal attachment.


Detailed Description:
Pregnancy is a process in which physical and hormonal changes occur in the female body. During this period, women experience mood swings due to changes in hormonal and social roles. These changes may predispose some women to mental health problems. Due to physiological and psychological changes during pregnancy, pregnant women may experience some problems such as nausea, vomiting, fatigue, anxiety, stress and depression . It is important to show pregnant women that these are normal experiences and to adopt an accepting attitude towards these experiences.

Perceived stress during pregnancy can cause many negative effects on maternal and fetal health. Among the causes of perceived stress are being diagnosed with a risky pregnancy, the presence of danger symptoms during pregnancy, the occurrence of adverse conditions during pregnancy and uncertainties about the pregnancy process.

Birth self-efficacy is defined as the level of assurance that a mother can give birth by using her abilities successfully. Birth self-efficacy is a motivating factor for the mother to cope with childbirth. High self-efficacy can reduce fear of childbirth and lead to better birth outcomes.

Prenatal attachment is defined as the expectant mother's attachment to the fetus through her behavior during pregnancy, establishing a close relationship and interacting with it. Prenatal attachment is an important component of the concept of fetal protection with the mother's attitudes of recognizing, being with and protecting her baby. The bond between mother and fetus has a great impact on the social and emotional development of the baby. A significant part of the attachment between mother and fetus begins during pregnancy and increases within a month after birth.

Supportive interventions, when necessary, to reduce perceived stress in pregnant women are critical for the protection of women's overall health. One of the non-pharmacological interventions is a mindfulness-based stress reduction program. Due to the success of standardized mindfulness-based interventions, mindfulness-based interventions have rapidly spread in western psychology research and practice. Abdolalipour et al. In a systematic review and meta-analysis of ten studies in 2023, Abdolalipour et al. reported that mindfulness practice reduced fear of childbirth."

Title: Dendritic Cells Loaded With Allogeneic Tumor Lysate (MesoPher) in Combination With a CD40 Agonist (Mitazalimab) in Metastatic Pancreatic Disease

Status: COMPLETED


Brief Summary:
Pancreatic cancer is expected to be the second leading cause of cancer-related death in 2020. Pancreatic cancer is known as an immunological cold tumor. It is thought that the characteristic desmoplastic stroma of established pancreatic adenocarcinomas acts as a physical as well as an immunosuppressive barrier leading to exclusion of T cells. The use of CD40 agonists (such as mitazalimab, also known as JNJ-64457107 and ADC-1013) may convert pancreatic adenocarcinomas into immunological hot tumors by T-cell-dependent and T-cell-independent mechanisms. Targeting the desmoplastic stroma, thereby making the tumor more permeable for T-cell infiltration, is seen as one of the assisting mechanisms. Furthermore, the immunological coldness of pancreatic cancers infers that tumor-reactive T-cell responses are absent or weak at best. Dendritic cell therapy introduces tumor-specific T cells and in combination with a CD40 agonist, may lead to synergistic anti-tumor responses which could be beneficial for pancreatic cancer patients.

Title: Does Skin Cleansing With Chlorhexidine Affect Skin Condition, Temperature and Colonization in Hospitalized Preterm Low Birth Weight Infants?: A Randomized Clinical Trial

Status: COMPLETED


Brief Summary:
The purpose of this study is to examine if single skin cleansing with 0.25% chlorhexidine affects skin condition, temperature, and bacterial colonization in stable preterm (28-36 weeks gestational age) low birth weight (1001-2000 g) infants admitted in a health facility.


Detailed Description:
Infections are the leading cause of death in neonates admitted to hospital - studies from developing countries suggest that about 25-71% of deaths occurring in neonatal intensive care units are secondary to infections.Such high infection-related mortality mandates an urgent implementation of simple and effective measures to prevent the occurrence of infections in these units.

The majority of neonatal infections occur in the first two weeks of life, when the epidermal barrier is immature and functionally compromised. Topical application of antiseptics until the skin matures could theoretically prevent skin colonization and reduce the incidence of systemic infections in neonates. Chlorhexidine, a broad-spectrum antiseptic used frequently for umbilical cord care in neonates, is now being evaluated for topical application to the skin. Hospital-based studies, involving predominantly term infants, have shown reductions in skin flora8 and a reduction in the incidence of sepsis following topical chlorhexidine application. In a community-based study in Nepal, a single skin cleansing with 0.25% chlorhexidine resulted in reduction in mortality among low birth weight infants; though the mechanism of the impact could not be determined, it was presumably due to increased susceptibility to transcutaneous sepsis in the low birth weight group.

Since the risk of infection in neonates is inversely related to their gestation, it is essential to evaluate the effect and the mechanism of such intervention in preterm neonates. These infants are, however, more prone to develop skin reactions following use of topical antiseptics. Preterm infants are also more prone to develop hypothermia following bathing/cleansing with antiseptic solution(s).

Since few studies have evaluated the effects of topical application of chlorhexidine in preterm infants admitted in a health care facility, we conducted the present study to examine if single skin cleansing with 0.25% chlorhexidine immediately after birth affects skin condition, temperature, and colonization in hospitalized preterm low birth weight infants."

Title: Multicenter Phase II Study of Axitinib +/- Pembrolizumab in First Line Treatment for Patients With Locally Advanced or Metastatic Papillary Renal Cell Carcinoma (PRCC)

Status: RECRUITING


Brief Summary:
Multicenter Phase II Study of Axitinib +/- Pembrolizumab in First Line Treatment for Patients With Locally Advanced or Metastatic Papillary Renal Cell Carcinoma (PRCC)


Detailed Description:
Papillary renal cell carcinoma (PRCC) is the second most common subtype of renal carcinoma accounting for approximatively 10-15% of all renal cancers. Different types of PRCC have been described on the basis of two histologic subtypes, type 1 in 25 to 30% cases, and type 2, with a worse prognosis reported for type 2 metastatic disease. There is currently no standard of care specifically dedicated to metastatic PRCC patients (mPRCC) and treatments developed for metastatic clear cell carcinomas are commonly used ; therefore, mPRCC enrollment in clinical trials is encouraged.

Clinical trials investigated treatments such as sunitinib, or everolimus approved for advanced clear cell carcinoma, or the dual kinase inhibitor directed both towards VEGF receptors (VEGFr) and the MET pathway foretinib, or more recently, the selective MET inhibitor savolitinib. Response rates (RR) were disappointing since generally below 15%, except in a subset of patients with MET germline alterations.

Axitinib which is indicated as second-line treatment in advanced clear cell carcinoma was investigated in a recent specific trial : the Axipap trial. This multicentric phase II trial was conducted after central pathology review to confirm the histologic subtype and a central review was performed to assess the primary endpoint : the 24 week progression free rate (24wPFR). With a median follow up time of 30 months this 24wPFR was found to be over 45%. The best response rate was 28.6% according to the investigators with a median duration of response near 8 months. The investigator assessed response rate was 35.7% in the type 2 subgroup indicating a more important effect of anti-VEGFr in this subtype than in the type 1. The median PFS was around 6 months and was virtually identical in both subtypes.

Recently, some preliminary results of the use of Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors in metastatic non clear cell carcinoma were made available. The PD1 directed antibody Pembrolizumab showed a 28% response rate in 118 patients with papillary tumors including a 6% complete remission rate ; the median duration of response was of 15.3 \[2.8-21.0+\] months. Atezolizumb (anti-PDL1) combined with Bevacizumab and Durvalumab (anti-PDL1) combined with savolitinib (Met directed TKI) obtained response rates in the same range. These preliminary results demonstrated the potential interest of combining axitinib with an immune check point inhibitor. The results of pembrolizumab as monotherapy were obtained in the largest subset with mPRC."

Title: Sacral Transcutaneous Nerve Stimulation Treatment for Functional Daytime Incontinence in Children With Over Active Bladder Syndrome

Status: COMPLETED


Brief Summary:
The purpose of this study is to perform a randomized controlled investigation of the effect of surface nerve stimulation on functional daytime incontinence in children with OAB.


Detailed Description:
Daytime urinary incontinence is common in children. At the age of 7 a prevalence of 2-9 % has been reported. Daytime urinary incontinence is a heterogenic multifactorial illness where the the symptoms has several degrees of severity and can be caused by different mechanisms. Daytime urinary incontinence can be etiologically classified in the rare neurogenic and structural forms and the common functional or idiopathic form (where no neurological or structural cause of the bladder dysfunction can be identified.

The symptom based diagnosis OAB (overactive bladder) is most often used to describe daytime urinary incontinence in children. OAB is defined as a symptom syndrome including urgency with or without urge incontinence in combination with frequency.

When urinary tract infection and neurogenic and structural causes has been excluded the nonpharmacological bladder rehabilitation is first line treatment of OAB. It is expected that approximately 50 % of the children can be relieved of symptoms by this treatment. In the non-responding cases behavioural modifying regimes can be coupled with anticholinergic medication. However, poor compliance of the child or parents, or dose limiting side effects often influences the efficacy of this intervention. Also a considerable number of children experience no or only limited effect from the treatment even though all instructions are complied with. This has let to research into new treatment modalities and the use of low frequency electrical current to inhibit detrusor overactivity in adults has become common. Pilot studies have indicated a significant effect of TENS on urinary incontinence in children with OAB.

Hypothesis:

* Sacral TENS is an effective treatment of urinary incontinence in children with OAB refractory to anticholinergic medication coupled with bladder training and voiding reeducation.
* The acute effect of sacral TENS can be identified by urodynamics
* It is possible to predict the outcome of sacral TENS treatment in these children.

  30 children (age 5-14 years) with functional daytime incontinence refractory to anticholinergic medication coupled with bladder training. The study protocol consists of 1 week of basic home registrations and a 4 day in-patient phase succeeded by a 4 week home training period. The participants will be randomized to treatment with either active or inactive TENS."

Title: Preventing the Loss of Muscle and Function in Hospitalized Older Adults

Status: COMPLETED


Brief Summary:
One third of independent older adults over the age of 65y will be hospitalized for an acute medical illness, injury, or operative procedure. Unfortunately, 50% of these older adults will experience functional decline during their hospital stay from the amount of time they are physically inactive and in bed. Following discharge, the functional deficits can persist for months and in many instances never return to pre-hospitalization levels thus compounding morbidity, health care costs and dying. A classic consequence of short-term bed rest in older adults is the significant loss in skeletal muscle mass which underlies the accelerated leg strength deficits. The investigator has shown that an important mechanism of skeletal muscle loss is the inability of nutrients to stimulate a normal muscle protein synthesis response; a process highly regulated by the mammalian target of rapamycin signaling pathway (mTOR) and amino acid transporters. Day to day maintenance of force generating muscle tissue is dictated by anabolic stimulation from muscle contraction and essential amino acid ingestion. Therefore, anabolic interventions such as neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) and high quality protein supplementation that contains a high proportion of essential amino acids (whey protein) may be promising approach to maintain leg muscle mass and strength in hospitalized older adults and prevent the long term consequences of repeated periods of short-term physical inactivity. The purpose of this study is to test in older adults if the combination of NMES and protein supplementation is capable of preserving muscle mass and strength and maintaining muscle nutrient anabolic sensitivity during bed rest. The investigators current hypotheses are that daily NMES and protein supplementation during 5-days of bed rest in older adults will: 1) preserve lower extremity muscle mass and strength and 2) maintain muscle nutrient anabolic sensitivity as measured by mTOR signaling and amino acid transporter expression. The long term goal is to utilize this inpatient preventative therapeutic approach in a clinical setting in which muscle mass and strength deficits are profound (e.g., intensive care patients).


Detailed Description:
A majority of older adults experience repeated periods of physical inactivity during acute illnesses, injuries or after an operative procedure. Following discharge from the hospital, daily activities are adversely impacted. Infirmity follows repeated periods of inactivity (termed ""catabolic hits"") that can occur over an older adults' lifespan and lead to a downward spiral of potentially irrecoverable deficits in physical function resulting in increased health care costs, loss of independence, and premature death."

Title: Femoral Nerve Block: Comparison of the Effectiveness of Ultrasound Control Versus Ultrasound Control With Electrical Stimulation of Peripheral Nerves

Status: COMPLETED


Brief Summary:
There is little work comparing the effectiveness of a femoral nerve block performed only under US guidance or US plus electrical stimulation of the peripheral nerve (EPN). The authors have shown the same effectiveness of these techniques(1).But the effectiveness of the blockade of the femoral nerve (complete blockade) performed in different ways turned out to be low valve: 71.7% for ultrasound in combination with electrical stimulation versus 69% for only ultrasound guidance.

Research hypothesis: the blockade of the femoral nerve performed only under ultrasound control has the same effectiveness as the blockade performed under the ultrasound control with EPN.

Title: Study of Avastin in Combination With Chemotherapy for the First Line Treatment of RAS Mutant Unresectable Colorectal Liver-limited Metastases

Status: COMPLETED


Brief Summary:
In this study, the investigators assessed the effect of avastin in combination with chemotherapy in the treatment of RAS mutant-type, unresectable colorectal liver-limited metastases


Detailed Description:
Patients will be eligible for inclusion if the patients have histologically confirmed colorectal adenocarcinoma with RAS mutant liver-confined metastases deemed non-resectable. Eligible patients will be randomly assigned to chemotherapy plus avastin (arm A) or chemotherapy alone (arm B). Treatment will continue until tumor response indicates suitability for surgery for liver metastases or until disease progression or unacceptable toxic effects. The primary endpoint is the conversion rate to radical resection for liver metastases，which will be assessed by local multidisciplinary team (includes more than three liver surgeons and one radiologist) with the use of contrast-enhanced CT or MRI after 4 cycles and then every other 4 cycles up to 12 cycles. To provide an objective assessment of changes in resectability, radiological images will be presented by a radiologist to more than 3 liver surgeons, who are blinded to the clinical data. Patients will be considered resectable if 50% or more of surgeons vote for radical resection of LM. For patients whose liver-metastases are assessed resectable, resection should be scheduled to be performed within 2\~3 weeks of the last treatment cycle.

Title: Evaluation of Bone Quality and Primary and Secondary Stability of Implants Installed in Alveolar Regeneration Area by Three Different Techniques

Status: UNKNOWN


Brief Summary:
The objective of this randomized controlled clinical study was to compare bone quality between three different alveolar ridge preservation methods, also with the evaluation of primary and secondary dental implant stabilities at these sites.


Detailed Description:
In the present study will be collected 24 patients, with indication of extraction of premolars or upper incisors. All participants will sign a Free and Informed Consent Form (TCLE), agreeing to participate voluntarily in this research.

Patients were randomly allocated into three groups according to the following treatments:

Group RET: Closure of the alveolus by first intention through palatal flap sliding according to the technique of Khoury.

SBC Group: Fill bone alveolus with Bone Ceramic® graft (Straumann AG, Basel, Switzerland) and cover it with palatal flap according to the technique of Khoury.

PRO Group: Alveolus sealing by a temporary ovoid pony of acrylic resin.

All patients will be prescribed the use of amoxicillin 2G, dexamethasone 4 mg and dipyrone sodium 500 mg one hour before the surgical procedure. After intra- and extraoral antisepsis with 0.12% and 2% chlorhexidine respectively, the sterile surgical fields were placed. Local anesthesia was obtained with lidocaine 2% epinephrine 1: 100,000.

With the aid of a surgical guide will be collected material for histological analysis, removed using trephine drill with 2.0 mm diameter. Samples will be removed before the incision, to be defined through the presence of gingival tissue the most coronal part of the sample. They will be placed immersed in a container with 10% formalin solution.

Then a linear incision will be made on the alveolar ridge in the region and detachment of the flap. The implants and components to be used are from Neodent® (Curitiba, PR, Brazil). The diameters used were standardized in 3.5 x 11.5 mm or 3.5 x 8 mm, depending on the remaining height of the collar. The milling and insertion system of the implants will follow the protocol recommended by the manufacturer. The drill rotation of the drills does not exceed 800 rpm, as recommended for Type III and IV bones.

The initial insertion of the implant will occur with the use of the contra-angle regulated at 30 rpm, the final insertion of the implant will be performed using a manual torque wrench, to measure the insertion torque and the registered value, preferably not exceeding 60 N.cm.The prosthetic component should be installed immediately after installation with an implant with a maximum torque of 20 N and on it adapted the SmartPeg® (Integration Diagnostics AB, Göteborg, Sweden)."

Title: A Single Visit, Cross-sectional, Observational Study of EBC H2O2 Levels and Other Exhaled Breath Condensate Parameters as Measured by Inflammacheck, in People With a Variety of Respiratory Conditions and Volunteers With no Known Lung Disease

Status: COMPLETED


Brief Summary:
People with lung conditions can suffer significantly with their symptoms and often require multiple trips to their GP or secondary care before a diagnosis is made. It can be difficult to diagnose lung disease and to differentiate between different lung conditions, so many people may be misdiagnosed or incorrectly not given a diagnosis. The tests currently used to diagnose lung diseases can be difficult or uncomfortable to do, especially if the person is experiencing lots of symptoms, and therefore can give poor or unreliable results.A new quick and easy to perform test is needed that can differentiate between various lung conditions and people with no lung disease, that can be performed in primary and secondary care with immediate results.


Detailed Description:
Lung disease is one of the largest contributors to morbidity and mortality in the UK, with 20% of the population diagnosed with, or receiving treatment for a respiratory condition.

Methods of diagnosis are still convoluted and can be difficult to perform, or very costly in patient and clinician time. Some diagnostic tests only look for a specific type of inflammation (e.g. Fractional exhaled Nitric Oxide) and so can overlook other causes. It can be hard to differentiate between different conditions, and as a result there are thousands of people in the UK who have undiagnosed or misdiagnosed respiratory disease.

Measurement of Exhaled Breath Condensate Hydrogen Peroxide (EBC H2O2) is performed during normal tidal breathing, and is well tolerated even in patients with severe airways obstruction and those unable to perform a consistent controlled exhalation. It is also not limited to inflammatory cell specific inflammation.

In studies using the previous version of the Inflammacheck™ device, significant differences have been demonstrated between levels of H2O2 in people with COPD, asthma, ILD and lung cancer compared to healthy controls. These studies have been instrumental in the continued improvement of the device, to ensure that the participant has the best experience, and simplify the procedure, so that the H2O2 result can be obtained with a single test in under 3 minutes.

Although the primary result of the Inflammacheck™ device is EBC H2O2, it is now also able to measure clinically important parameters including breath temperature, humidity, Carbon Dioxide waveforms, and intra-thoracic pressure changes. These parameters, in combination with the EBC H2O2 may be able to be used together to identify differences between people with various respiratory diseases and healthy volunteers."

The purpose of the study is to explore how feedback of cellular DNA (Deoxyribonucleic Acid) damage, as a marker of exposure to the genotoxic agents of tobacco smoke, promotes cessation.


Detailed Description:
The study aims to recruit 50 smokers who are not engaged in quitting. The study will involve two in-person visits. During visit 1, participants will complete a baseline survey and have their blood drawn. Approximately two weeks later, in visit 2, smokers will be randomized in a 1:2:2 ratio to one of three arms:

1. education about harms of smoking (control group);
2. same education plus information on DNA damage and biomarker feedback (biomarker arm) without visual of damage; or
3. same as arm 2 except accompanied with visuals of participants' normal and DNA damage cells. Participants in the this arm will be informed of their proportion of leucocytes showing DNA damage with pictures of their normal and damaged cells.

Title: Controlled, Randomized, Four-arm Comparative, Open Label, Multi-centric Clinical Trial to Compare the Efficacy and Safety Parameters of the Once-a-week or Once-a-month Administered 7000 IU, or 30000 IU Vitamin D (Cholecalciferol) to a 1000 IU Dosage Applied Daily in Vitamin D Deficient Patients

Status: COMPLETED


Brief Summary:
Circa-annual variations in 25-hydroxyvitamin D \[25(OH)D\] levels have been well established, and there also seems to be an effect of season on bone turnover and bone mass. been shown that bone turnover follows a circa-annual rhythm. On the basis of human clinical results, it was suggested that adipose tissue functions as a vitamin D buffering system that to a certain extent prevents uncontrolled synthesis of 25(OH)D in the liver. Directly related to this issue is the question of how much vitamin D is needed to ensure target serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D \[25(OH)D\] concentrations. According to the recommended dietary allowances, persons should achieve ""levels of intake of essential nutrients considered to be adequate to meet the known nutritional needs of practically all healthy persons"" Moreover it is important to note that the significant percentage of the population is temporarily of continuously deficient in vitamin D. In the similar condition of vitamin D deficiency, the aetiology is very different since only as almost exclusively as a consequence of a primary disease in children it is manifested: hypovitaminosis D is highly prevalent among children on renal substitution therapy, regardless of the type of therapy used and the stage of renal failure.

The rationale providing high dose strengths of vitamin D based on an assumption of better compliance especially in adult with senior age patients; also a potential for faster resolution of vitamin D deficiency, since utilization of cholecalciferol is higher when patients had low levels of 25(OH)D, and vice versa, there is a plateau phase when close to normal range (Vieth 2001).

According to clinical data, a doses equivalent of daily 1000 IU, (7000 IU per week, or 30000 IU per month) is considered as a minimal effective dose to treat vitamin D deficiency. The treatment of vitamin D with a duration of 30 days may result and increase of 6-12.5 nmol/L. With the deficiency criteria considered as \<20 ng/ml, the vitamin supplementation is indicative, the treatment dosages should be adjusted to the increase planned to achieve the mid-normal range.

As the base of calculations, the doses of 40 IU results in an increase of 0.4 ng/ml in a period of 60 days. Accordingly 1000 IU in a period of 2-5 month resulted in an increase of approx 10 ng/ml. The risk of overdose in relatively low, since the absorption and the metabolic path is well controlled: automatic mechanisms downregulation at normal ranges.

In this study the there are three groups in the similar daily dose equivalent of 1000 IU/day."

Manual dexterity deficits and loss of motor automaticity are commonly seen in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). Amongst these problems, using a touchscreen is becoming increasingly burdensome. In addition, a variety of non-motor symptoms, including cognitive impairment have a significant impact on the quality of life of patients with PD which will also affect the use of mobile devices. As the degradation of dopaminergic neurons in the striatum results in an impaired capacity for motor learning and more specifically for consolidation in motor memory, the investigators want to unravel the remaining rehabilitation potential in this patient group. Recent work on the consolidation of an intensive writing training program from our group, indicated inconsistent and variable results on retention of learning gains, which strongly depended on the clinical profile of the patients involved. This raises the question whether it is possible to predict different training responses and better understand how this is determined by clinical characteristics, such as disease severity and the degree of cognitive impairment. Also, baseline task performance and early acquisition may determine long-term learning outcomes. Our main focus (primary dependent outcome) is to know which patients will be able to retain the learning gains after 4 weeks without training. For this aim, the investigators will use a home-based training program of a touchscreen task called the Swipe-Slide Pattern (SSP) task. Training of this SSP-task will be offered on a tablet under single and dual task conditions in a random fashion, not only to provide variation but also to increase the cognitive challenge, thereby stimulating consolidation. A crucial factor, which may affect the success of training, is compliance, which the investigators will measure objectively for the first time. As independent variables the investigators will measure several motor and cognitive functions as well as compliance, while including a broad sample of PD patients.


Detailed Description:
In order to achieve personalised rehabilitation in PD, it is imperative to understand which factors predict whether a patient will benefit from targeted training. To date, only few studies have looked into the predictors of gait and balance training and identified cognitive function at baseline and initial motor performance as the most important determinants. However, these studies focused on global cognitive function, while cognitive subdomains, such as executive function and memory, which are most affected in PD, likely impact more seriously on learning. In addition, patients with cognitive impairments were excluded in these studies."

Title: Practical Geriatric Assessment in Older Adults With Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Undergoing Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy

Status: RECRUITING


Brief Summary:
National guidelines recommend that older adults with cancer undergo a special health assessment before starting cancer treatment. This type of assessment evaluates physical function, nutrition, social support, psychological well-being, medical conditions (both cancer-related and non-cancer-related), and cognitive function. The results can help doctors make better treatment decisions and determine whether additional support services-such as nutrition counseling, physical therapy, or social work-would be beneficial. Even though these assessments are recommended, they are not typically used because they need to be performed by a specialist and can take over an hour to complete. Given these challenges, a 10-15-minute assessment called the Practical Geriatric Assessment (PGA) was recently developed. The PGA can be completed by any healthcare provider and helps identify older adults who may need extra support alongside their cancer treatment. While the PGA has the potential to make geriatric assessments more accessible, the investigators do not yet know whether patients will find it useful or easy to complete.

Additionally, it is unclear whether using the PGA will lead to more referrals for recommended supportive care services. This study aims to address these questions. The investigators will evaluate whether using the PGA impacts the number of patients referred to recommended supportive care services. Investigators will also evaluate how participants feel about completing the PGA, including how easy or difficult it is, and to assess the feasibility of implementing this survey on a larger scale. Finally, the investigators will use facial photographs and audio-visual data from the PGA to develop and evaluate artificial intelligence algorithm(s) to identify vulnerable patients who might benefit from additional supportive care services.


Detailed Description:
Comprehensive geriatric assessment (CGA) is one proven mechanism for delineating baseline care needs and improving outcomes in older adults with lung cancer. This type of geriatrician-led assessment, which captures functional ability, health, and socio-environmental situation, can be used to identify vulnerable older adults for whom tailored interventions might optimize care. However, CGA can be resource-intensive to perform, and may not practically possible in all settings, particularly given national shortages in geriatricians. At BWH/DFCI, retrospective work among patients with stage I-II NSCLC suggests fewer than 5% of patients receive CGA, despite 76% meeting national guidelines for this type of evaluation. These findings underscore the practical challenges of assessing geriatric needs, even in high-resource settings."

Title: Evaluation of Citicoline Concentration in Human Vitreous After Topical Administration: a Cross-sectional Study

Status: COMPLETED


Brief Summary:
Elegible patients were included in the study and underwent treatment with a solution of citicoline 1% eye-drops, 0.2% high molecular weight hyaluronic acid and 0.01% benzalkonium chloride prior to surgery. The vitreous samples were taken at the beginning of the surgery and analyzed for qualitative/quantitative determination of vitreous concentration of citicoline and its metabolites by means of high performance liquid chromatography.


Detailed Description:
At the visit all patients underwent comprehensive ophthalmological examination including best corrected visual acuity assessment, slit lamp evaluation, IOP measurement using Goldmann applanation tonometry, and fundus dilated indirect ophthalmoscopy.

Additionally, all patients had central retinal thickness measurements with spectral-domain optical coherence tomography associated with central corneal thickness (CCT) and corneal endothelial cells density (ECD) evaluations.

Patients started the treatment with 1 drop of a solution of citicoline 1% eye-drops, 0.2% hyaluronic acid and 0.01% benzalkonium chloride for 3 times/day over a total time of 14 days before surgery and 1 drop 2 hours prior to the surgery.

Five patients served as controls and received a vehicle solution without citicoline.

The primary aim of the study was to evaluate the presence and concentration of citicoline and its metabolites (choline, cytidine and uridine) in the vitreous body in vivo in human eyes after topical eye-drops administration by means of high performance liquid chromatography.

Title: Development of Robust Corneal Biomechanical Biomarkers for Glaucoma Using Brillouin Microscopy

Status: RECRUITING


Brief Summary:
This pilot study evaluates the biomechanical properties of the cornea in glaucoma patients using Brillouin microscopy, a non-contact imaging technique. The study aims to compare corneal stiffness between patients with normal-tension glaucoma, high-tension glaucoma, and healthy controls, and to assess changes in corneal biomechanics following intraocular pressure (IOP)-lowering treatment. The goal is to determine whether Brillouin-derived biomechanical measurements can serve as biomarkers for glaucoma risk and progression.

Status: ACTIVE_NOT_RECRUITING


Brief Summary:
The purpose of this study is to test the safety and efficacy of GD2-CART01, a CAR T cell treatment targeting GD2 in paediatric or young adult patients with High Risk and/or relapsed/refractory Neuroblastoma.

A small exploratory cohort of patients with GD2-positive tumors other than Neuroblastoma has also been included.


Detailed Description:
The study will consist of 2 phases, a Phase I or dose escalation phase and a Phase II or expansion phase. Paediatric or young adult patients with relapsed High Risk and/or relapsed/refractory Neuroblastoma will be enrolled in the study.

After completion of the phase I portion of the study, a small cohort of patients with GD2-positive tumors other than Neuroblastoma has also been included.

Eligible patients will undergo leukapheresis in order to harvest T cells, which will be manufactured to obtain the autologous CAR T product GD2-CART01, a GD2-targeting CAR T product. Briefly, the patients will be treated with a lymphodepleting regimen containing conventional chemotherapic agents and subsequently will receive a single infusion of GD2-CART01. Moreover, the product contains a suicide gene safety switch (namely inducible Caspase 9): in case of relevant toxicities, the patient will receive the dimerizing agent in order to activate the apoptotic pathway in the infused T cells.

After infusion of CAR T cells, the patients will enter a 5-year active follow-up period.

Title: The Comparison of Transplantation From Family-mismatched/Haploidentical Donors With Matched Unrelated Donors in Adult Patients With Acute Myeloid Leukemia

Status: COMPLETED


Brief Summary:
This study will compare the clinical outcomes of transplants from family-mismatched/haploidentical donors (FMT) with transplants from 8/8-matched unrelated donor (MUT), which is a current gold standard donors when lacking of HLA-matched-siblings

1. Primary objectives: Overall survival of FMT may be similar to that of MUT
2. Secondary objectives:

   i. Comparison of disease-free survival, relapse, non-relapse mortality, immune reconstitution cytomegalovirus infection, and acute or chronic graft-versus-host disease between FMT and MUT.

   ii. Investigation of possible biomarkers related with above events after transplantation


Detailed Description:
For patients lacking an HLA-identical sibling, 8/8-matched unrelated donors are currently the ""gold standard"" for a donor, since outcomes after HLA-identical sibling have been compared to 8/8-matched unrelated donors. Currently, there are three alternative graft sources, including mismatched unrelated donors, familial mismatch/haploidentical donors, and umbilical cord bloods. Compared with other sources, transplants from familial mismatch/haploidentical donors (FMT) have the benefit of an immediate availability of a donor, particularly for those patients who urgently need transplantation. Initial reports had characterized FMT to a poor engraftment and a high incidence of graft-versus-host disease. However, outcomes of FMT have significantly improved over the past decade in the optimization of conditioning regimen and graft selection to allow a stable engraftment across major HLA barriers, with promising leukemia-free survival in adults with acute leukemia. Despite the encouraging results and potential benefit of FMT, there have been few studies comparing clinical outcomes of FMT with other donor types, particularly in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) as a single disease. Since August 2008, we have been continuously performing FMT using unmanipulated donor cells and a less aggressive conditioning regimen in high-risk AML lacking an HLA-identical sibling, 8/8 or 7/8-matched unrelated donors. We reported the feasibility of FMT using our novel reduced-intensity regimen without ex vivo T-cell depletion, showing early results similar to outcomes of transplant from 8/8-matched unrelated donors (MUT). This study will test the hypothesis that overall survival at 3 years after FMT is similar to overall survival after MUT.


Eligibility Criteria:

Brief Summary:
Clinical Comparison of xenograft with hydrogel versus xenograft alone in the socket preservation After tooth extraction: A Randomized controlled Clinical Trial The ideal scaffolds used for alveolar ridge preservation are supposed to show good biocompatibility, mechanical properties, and formability for irregularly shaped bone defects, as well as degradation rates matching bone growth . One of the most used synthetic scaffolds is hydrogel. Hydrogels owning three-dimensional cross-linked network structures have physical and chemical properties like human tissues . They can not only simulate the extracellular matrix (ECM) of bone but also allow the storage, and transport of various growth factors, cytokines, and nutrients due to their high permeability .


Detailed Description:
Research question:

Is xenograft with hydrogel more effective than xenograft in the socket preservation After tooth extraction? Statement of the problem Alveolar socket preservation therapies aim to maintaining the hard and soft tissue dimensions of the alveolar ridge that are partially lost after tooth extraction as part of the natural physiological healing process. The reduction of alveolar bone volume following tooth extraction may interfere with placement of implants and affect the treatment and success of fixed or removable prosthesis with regard to function and esthetics. Alveolar socket preservation via socket filling with a bone graft can be an effective therapy to prevent physiologic bone loss after extraction of teeth in both the horizontal and the vertical dimension - Rationale for conducting a study The ideal scaffolds used for alveolar ridge preservation are supposed to show good biocompatibility, mechanical properties, and formability for irregularly shaped bone defects, as well as degradation rates matching bone growth . One of the most used synthetic scaffolds is hydrogel. Hydrogels owning three-dimensional cross-linked network structures have physical and chemical properties like human tissues .

Title: Un Meilleur Sommeil Pour Une Meilleure résilience : Une Plateforme en Ligne autogérée Pour Les Victimes d'Agression Sexuelle

Status: ACTIVE_NOT_RECRUITING


Brief Summary:
There are 636,000 self-reported cases of sexual assault annually in Canada, and nine out of ten persons who have experienced sexual assault are women. Cognitive and behavioural therapies (CBT) are the treatment of choice for many psychological problems arising from sexual assault. However, accessing CBT is a significant challenge, especially for women who have experienced sexual assault who may be ashamed and not disclose the sexual assault. Online CBT is an effective option to circumvent these barriers. In addition to being accessible and less resource-intensive, studies report that patients are less inhibited and that the online environment provides greater emotional safety. There is also a growing body of evidence that online CBT programs requiring little or no contact with a mental health professional are effective, this having been demonstrated primarily with individuals with anxiety and mood disorders. But when it comes to treating the psychological symptoms of sexual assault in potentially vulnerable individuals, can we really suggest a self-care approach? There is no direct empirical evidence to support such a recommendation, and it is this important question that this project wishes to address. To compare the effectiveness, acceptability and user engagement in a self-managed treatment platform with or without the support of a therapist to reduce post-traumatic symptoms, depression and insomnia in people who have suffered one or more sexual assaults, 204 victims of sexual assault experiencing significant distress will be recruited and randomly assigned to either the self-managed or the therapist-assisted online treatment condition. Participants will complete measures assessing post-traumatic stress disorder, insomnia, depression, anxiety, and maladaptive beliefs before, during, after and 3 months after treatment. Secondary outcome will be and appreciation of the online treatment measures by a self-report questionnaire and a semi-structured interview. If effective in reducing symptoms, this treatment would offer the potential to support a self-care approach to treating a wide range of psychological symptoms resulting from sexual assault. The self-managed online platform would fill a service gap deplored by this population.


Detailed Description:
Background. There are 636,000 self-reported cases of sexual assault annually in Canada, and nine out of ten persons who have experienced sexual assault are women. An alarming paradox is that although they suffer significant adverse consequences of sexual assault on their functioning, they have less social support than victims of other traumatic events to manage the psychological consequences of sexual assault."

Seropositive Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is characterized by autoantibodies that develop prior to clinical onset, allowing identification of individuals at risk for disease development. In a unique program in Stockholm, seropositive individuals presenting with musculoskeletal complains are currently identified and followed-up in a dedicated outpatient clinical program. Despite significant disease burden and increased sick leave among these individuals, we lack today any therapeutic and preventive measures.

We aim to (1). establish a nation-wide health program, (2). develop an algorithm for disease risk estimation and (3). test a novel strategy to delay and/or prevent disease onset in seropositive at risk individuals with musculoskeletal complains. We will perform a multicentre randomised study to treat autoantibody-positive individuals at risk for developing RA presenting with pain (Population), by repurposing of bisphosphonates (Intervention) as compared to placebo (Control) to treat pain (primary Outcome) and delay/prevent RA development during 1-year follow-up (secondary Outcome)


Detailed Description:
we have recently identified a novel disease-triggering pathogenic mechanism in autoantibody-positive individuals consisting in a bone-mediated induction of pain by autoantibodies. We hypothesize that specific targeting of this new mechanism, rather than using therapies developed for already established disease (where other mechanisms are active), will be able to treat pain with arthralgia and halt disease progression in seropositive at-risk individuals.

We will address this hypothesis by repurposing of bisphosphonates, currently used in clinical practice in both RA patients as well as in many individuals at risk for RA (mainly women in post-menopausal age). We will perform a multi centre, prospective, randomised, double-blind and placebo-controlled study with 2 parallel groups.

Patients will be randomised 1:1 to receive either one infusion aclasta (5 mg zolendronic acid, n=40) or placebo (n=40). The primary outcome is the VAS pain score and the study is powered to detect a 20% difference in the primary endpoint between the active and the control arm. The study is powered to detect a 20-percentage point difference in proportions between the control and the treated group. Subjects may withdraw from the trial at any time at their own or the investigators request for safety reasons."

Title: Biomarker Identification to Predict the Evolution of Migraine From an Episodic to a Chronic Condition

Status: COMPLETED


Brief Summary:
The main aim of the present pilot study is to prove the possibility to use the Nitroglycerin (NTG) model to describe the pathophysiology of headache using task-free advanced Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) techniques, in order to depict the static changes of the ictal and inter-ictal phase of migraine attacks vs the pain free state in healthy subjects and to compare that with the spontaneous headache attack experienced by chronic migraineurs.


Detailed Description:
Resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) has depicted cyclical functional connectivity changes during the ictal and inter-ictal phase of the migraine attack. In this pilot study, Functional Connectivity (FC) changes during nitroglycerin (NTG) induced migraine attacks were assessed vs the pain-free condition in healthy subjects.

To this end, subjects with episodic migraine (EM) without aura were enrolled. NTG-triggered a spontaneous-like migraine attack in the subjects. They underwent 4 rs-fMRI scan repetitions during different phases of the attack (baseline, prodromal, full blown, recovery phase) with a 3 Tesla MR scanner. According to the pain field literature, several regions of interests were studied, in particular the thalamic areas and the salience network (SN) were selected as primary areas of interest for the analyses. Subjects' rs-fMRI data were first processed with a seed-based correlation analysis (SCA) to assess the static changes in FC between the thalamus and the rest of the brain during the experiment. The wavelet coherence approach (WCA) were also applied to test the changes in time-in-phase coherence between the thalamus and the salience network (SN).

Healthy subject were administered nitroglycerin as well and scanned at a pain free baseline and after 3 hours in order to compare the response.

The rebound headache that followed acute drug withdrawal were used as a surrogate paradigm of spontaneous attack. Patients with chronic migraine and medication overuse were hospitalized for a supervised withdrawal program at the Mondino Foundation; during the program if they experienced a rebound headache attack, they were scanned with a rs-fMRI acquisition.

The acquired imagines were analyzed with the same procedure regarding the evaluation of static and dynamic functional connectivity fluctuation."

Title: 5HTP Regulation Of Asthma In Children

Status: RECRUITING


Brief Summary:
The purpose of this study is to learn more about if taking a supplement called 5-hydroxytryptophan (5HTP) can improve breathing and anxiety symptoms related to asthma. To help learn more subjects will either be assigned to a group that is taking the supplement (5HTP) or a group that is taking a placebo. This will be decided randomly. Later in the study subjects will crossover to the other group.There are 5 study visits over the course of about 12 weeks.


Detailed Description:
The objective of this study is to test the hypothesis that over-the-counter amino acid supplement 5HTP (isolated from the plant Griffonia Simplifolia) reduces human allergic lung responses and consequently improves lung function. The primary outcome is the change in FEV1. We anticipate the 5HTP at the proposed doses will improve lung function as in preclinical studies that used clinically relevant 5HTP. Secondary outcomes will be blood eosinophil counts and reduced symptoms for anxiety/depression, as seen in changes in the anxiety-depression scores from questionnaires (CES-DC \& SCARED). The results from these studies have the transformative potential to influence approaches to improve lung function and asthma-associated anxiety/depression.

* Aim 1: Test that 5HTP improves lung function in children with allergic asthma
* Aim 2: Test that 5HTP reduces eosinophil numbers in the blood and nasal fluid of patients with asthma from Aim 1
* Aim 3: Test that 5HTP decreases lung inflammation, increases cortisol and prolactin without altering systemic plasma concentrations of 5HTP, serotonin, 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA), and dopamine

Title: Assessment of Hearing in Children Born to Rheumatic Diseased Women Treated With Antimalarial Drugs During Pregnancy

Status: UNKNOWN


Brief Summary:
Evaluation of the hearing functions of children born to rheumatic diseased mothers who received gestational antimalarial drugs versus those didn't receive gestational antimalarials drugs compared with normal healthy children.


Detailed Description:
Rheumatic diseases are autoimmune illnesses characterized by tissue damage, caused by abnormal immunologic reaction against own cells, tissues or organs.Many of these rheumatic diseases preferentially occur in women during the childbearing age.

The transplacental passage of maternal antibody may result in a variety of adverse fetal effects including thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, hemolysis and thyroid disease. Both fetal hypo and hyper thyroidism may occur and maternal hypothyroidism particularly during the 1st trimester is associated with impaired fetal neurological development and delayed mental and motor development.

Hydroxychloroquine (CQ), the hydroxyl derivative of chloroquine, is an antimalarial agent which is widely used, either alone or in combination with other agents, in the treatment of SLE, rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and various other autoimmune diseases.

Hydroxychloroquine is safe during pregnancy, as it is not associated with an increased rate of congenital malformations. However, isolated cases of ocular (retinal pigment deposits) and auditory abnormalities were reported.

An increase in high-frequency hearing threshold is the earliest change in the auditory function for most drug induced hearing losses, including the irreversible damage caused by antimalarials.

The investigators therefore will use audiological methods for detection of hearing impairment in children delivered for mothers receiving antimalarials during pregnancy with rheumatic diseases.


Eligibility Criteria:
Inclusion Criteria:

* children males \& females
* Age 4 to 16 years.
* whose mothers have rheumatic diseases during pregnancy with gestational intake of antimalarial drugs as a treatment.

Exclusion Criteria:

* Prematurity, history of prenatal, natal or post natal medical problems.
* Family history +ve.
* Consanguinity +ve.
* Gestational intake of other ototoxic drugs.
* Use of antimalarial due to diseases other than rheumatic diseases.
* Administration of antimalarial before pregnancy.

Title: A Possible Therapeutic Role for Adenosine During Inflammation

Status: COMPLETED


Brief Summary:
The adenosine receptor is known for its anti-inflammatory actions and could therefore be a potential target in the treatment of sepsis and septic shock. Stimulation of the adenosine receptor could potentially lead to a decrease in inflammation and tissue damage.

Under normal conditions adenosine is formed either by an intracellular 5'nucleotidase, which dephosphorylates AMP, or by the hydrolysis of S-adenosylhomcysteine by hydrolase. An alternative pathway of AMP degradations is provided by the cytosolic enzyme AMP deaminase (AMPD), which catalyses the irreversible deamination of AMP to inosine monophosphate and ammonia.

In humans four AMPD isoforms have been described, named after the source from which they were initially purified; M (muscle), L (liver), E1 and E2 (erythrocyte), encoded by AMPD1, AMPD2 and AMPD3. Approximately 15-20% of Caucasian and African American individuals are heterozygous or homozygous for the 34C\>T variant of AMPD1.

We hypothesize that healthy volunteers who have the polymorphism for AMPD1 have a less severe inflammatory response to LPS and show less (severe) organ failure. This hypothesis is based on the expected higher levels of adenosine in patients with the AMPD1 polymorphism. This hypothesis is strengthened by the fact that patients with coronary artery disease and the AMPD1 polymorphism show improved cardiovascular survival (Anderson JL et al. J Am Coll Cardiol 2000; 36: 1248-52) possibly based on higher adenosine levels by reduced AMPD activity. Furthermore the polymorphism predicts improved clinical outcome in patients with heart failure (Loh E et al. Circulation 1999) also based on a hypothetical elevation of adenosine.

We hypothesize that:

The C34T-polymorphism of the enzyme AMP-deaminase leads to a decreased inflammatory respons and thereby a decrease of LPS-induced tissue damage.

A second hypothesis is based on the antagonism of the adenosine receptor, by caffeine;

Antagonism of the adenosine receptor by caffeine leads to an increased LPS-induced inflammatory reaction and an increase in (subclinical) tissue damage?

Title: A Community-led Intervention (DAiLY) Promoting a Heart-healthy Diet and Active Lifestyle: The Yup&#39;ik Way

Status: RECRUITING


Brief Summary:
Heart disease is the leading cause of death for Alaska Native men and the second leading cause of death (after cancer) among women and Alaska Native people overall. The overarching goal of the proposed multilevel, multicomponent intervention, Diet and Active Lifestyle - Yuuyaraq (DAiLY), is to reduce consumption of highly processed store-bought foods while promoting intake of subsistence foods, healthy store-bought foods, and a more active lifestyle to reduce heart disease risk. The Yup\&amp;amp;#39;ik word Yuuyaraq means 'the Yup'ik way of life' and encompasses a worldview in which living in harmony with the environment, as well as sharing of subsistence foods and traditional knowledge is central. The proposed DAiLY intervention is grounded in the Yup'ik worldview and Indigenous Food Sovereignty, and supported by a foundation of trust resulting from 22 years of continuous Community Based Participatory Research on heart disease risk andprotective factors with Yup'ik communities. DAiLY is a direct response to the intervention research requests of community partners and input from Yup'ik Community Research Associates and a Yup'ik Community Planning Group during the formative research and community engagement process shaping this proposal. The proposed intervention, based on the Warnecke model of health disparities and social cognitive theory, includes three components: 1) home-based workshops, framed in the Yupik worldview, led by Community Research Associates to facilitate interactive discussions with community members about healthy market foods, as well as the health benefits of locally harvested traditional foods and increased physical activity; 2) local food store interventions to increase access to, and help build demand for, healthy food options; and 3) traditional community activities, including Yuraq (Yup'ik traditional dance), Native sports events, and berry festivals, that provide opportunities to increase physical activity. The three components will be supported and reinforced via community media, including Facebook, text messaging and visual materials. A continuous metabolic syndrome score will be used as the primary outcome to assess changes in heart disease risk, and objective stable isotope biomarkers of diet and a validated food frequency questionnaire will be used to measure intake of traditional and market foods. We will test the DAiLY intervention in four Yupik communities, randomized to immediate and delayed intervention. Aim 1, will determine the effectiveness of the DAiLY intervention on heart disease risk by measuring change in a continuous metabolic syndrome risk score (primary outcome)."

Title: Probiotics for the Prevention of Major Complications of Cirrhosis

Status: COMPLETED


Brief Summary:
The purpose of this study is to determine whether probiotics are effective in the prevention of the complications of liver cirrhosis.


Detailed Description:
Colonic bacteria clearly play a major role in the pathogenesis of major complications in patients with liver cirrhosis. By producing ammonia and endotoxins they can cause hepatic encephalopathy , and their translocation from the gut to the peritoneal cavity is the major mechanism for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. There are also new studies suggesting a possible connection between bacterial translocation and bleeding from esophageal varices. Some of the therapeutic measures for the treatment and prevention of complications in cirrhotic patients, such as antibiotics and lactulose, are partially directed against gut bacteria.

In recent years there is a growing interest in the effect of probiotic bacteria on gut flora and prevention of infection. They were found to prevent pediatric infectious diarrhea and antibiotic-associated diarrhea- especially those caused by Clostridium difficile.

The probiotic bacteria, among which the most common are the lactose fermenting Lactobacilli, inhibit the growth of pathogenic bacteria by acidifying the gut lumen, competing for nutrients, and by producing antimicrobial substances. They adhere to the gut mucosa and by that are thought to prevent bacterial translocation from the gut. These effects of probiotics raised the idea that they may have a role in the treatment and prevention of cirrhosis complications. A recent study examined the effect of probiotics on patients with minimal chronic hepatic encephalopathy. Hepatic encephalopathy was reversed in 50% of the patients receiving probiotics. These patients also demonstrated a significant reduction of blood levels of ammonia, bilirubin and ALT, and of pathologic bacteria in stool cultures. This study showed promising results but was carried out on a relatively small population. Furthermore, the effect of probiotics on the prevention of hepatic encephalopathy and other major complications of cirrhosis has not been studied yet. Therefore, more studies are needed to establish the role of probiotics in patients with cirrhosis.

Status: ACTIVE_NOT_RECRUITING


Brief Summary:
This study aims to evaluate the safety and efficacy of novel Inverted T trabeculectomy in Primary Congenital Glaucoma (PCG). It enrolled 50 eyes of 25 children with PCG. The mean age at the time of surgery was 12±11 months, and the mean presenting IOP was 40±4 mmHg. Patients with previous intra-ocular or conjunctival surgery, those who had significant ocular trauma, and patients with congenital glaucoma associated with ocular anomalies diseases were excluded from the study. All patients had Inverted T trabeculectomy under general anesthesia. The IOP in the operated eyes was followed up for 36 months.


Detailed Description:
This study included patients from the glaucoma clinic at Benha University Hospital between April 2015 and October 2017. All were diagnosed with PCG based on an intraocular pressure (IOP) measurement of 21 mmHg or more at birth or shortly after, up to the age of 12 months. Patients with previous intraocular or conjunctival surgery, those with significant ocular trauma, and those with congenital glaucoma associated with other ocular anomalies that would affect IOP were excluded from the study.

The procedure principles and potential complications were discussed with the children's parents or legal guardians, and they gave written informed consent before surgery. This study was approved by the Benha Faculty of Medicine's ethical committee (Approval number RC 9-1-2025) and conducted according to Helsinki's declaration.

All patients underwent complete ophthalmic examination under general anaesthesia before surgery. IOP was measured 5 minutes after injecting intravenous Ketamine 1mg/kg for induction of anaesthesia. We used a Perkins tonometer (Haag-Streit, UK) to measure the IOP before applying the eyelid speculum. Corneal clarity was assessed under a surgical microscope, the corneal diameter was recorded using a surgical caliber, and fundus examination was done by indirect ophthalmoscope. A surgical Swan Jacob gonioprism assessed the anterior chamber angle when the cornea was clear enough to achieve a good view.

All surgeries were performed under general anaesthesia by the same surgeon (AEH).

Title: A Single-Center Controlled Registry to Evaluate the Concentric Retriever System for the Treatment of Stroke

Status: COMPLETED


Brief Summary:
The primary purpose is to study the safety and effectiveness of the Concentric Retriever Device(CRD)in ischemic stroke patients who undergo clot retrieval with the CRD within 8 hours of stroke symptom onset. The CRD has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to retrieve foreign bodies (such as pieces of metal) from blood vessels in the body. The CRD is a small metal wire with a loop at the end (like a corkscrew) that removes clots from arteries and thereby restores blood flow to the brain. Prior versions of the CRD may have been too soft to pull out clots, just as a corkscrew that is too soft would not pull out corks. The current version of the CRD is not as soft and may be more effective in retrieving clots.

Title: A Phase 2, Double-blind, Placebo-controlled Study to Evaluate the Antiviral Activity, Clinical Outcomes, Safety, Tolerability, and Pharmacokinetic/Pharmacodynamic Relationships of Different Doses of JNJ-53718678 in Children >=28 Days and <=3 Years of Age With Acute Respiratory Tract Infection Due to Respiratory Syncytial Virus Infection

Status: TERMINATED


Brief Summary:
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the antiviral activity, clinical outcomes, safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic relationships of different oral dose levels of JNJ-53718678 in children greater than or equal to 28 days and less than or equal to 3 years of age with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) disease (hospitalized participants \[Cohort 1\] or outpatients \[Cohort 2\]).


Detailed Description:
JNJ-53718678 is an investigational respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) specific fusion inhibitor and is under development for the treatment of RSV infection, which results in an upper and/or lower respiratory tract illness. The primary hypothesis of this study is that JNJ-53718678 has antiviral activity against RSV (that is, results in a decrease in RSV nasal viral load from immediately prior to first dose of study drug until Day 5). This will be assessed by a positive dose-response relationship of JNJ-53718678 compared to placebo. Besides the RSV nasal viral load through day 5, other timepoints will also be evaluated as well as other nasal viral load related parameters. In addition, the evolution of signs and symptoms of RSV disease will be evaluated. Participants' safety will be monitored throughout the study by evaluating the occurrence and severity of adverse events and by laboratory and electrocardiogram measurements. Study participants will be identified when they are hospitalized or expected to be hospitalized within 24 hours after presentation to the hospital (Cohort 1) or present for medical care as outpatients (Cohort 2) with symptoms of an acute respiratory illness supporting a diagnosis of RSV infection. Eligible participants will be randomized 1:1:1 to receive either a low or a high dose of JNJ 53718678 or placebo and will be receiving study treatment for 7 days. They will be followed up for 3 weeks after the last dose. The total study duration for each participant will be approximately 29 days.

Title: Oral Combination Chemotherapy in Conjunction With G-CSF in the Treatment of Elderly Patients With Intermediate and High Grade Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma

Status: TERMINATED


Brief Summary:
RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Combining more than one drug and giving the drugs in different ways may kill more tumor cells.

PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of oral combination chemotherapy and G-CSF in elderly patients with intermediate- or high-grade non-Hodgkin's lymphomas.


Detailed Description:
OBJECTIVES:

* Assess the feasibility and toxicity of oral combination chemotherapy with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor in elderly patients with intermediate and high grade non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.
* Determine the objective response rate, response duration, and survival in this patient population.

OUTLINE: All patients receive one cycle of oral chemotherapy, 6 weeks in duration. Etoposide is given on days 1-3 and cyclophosphamide and procarbazine are given on days 22-31 of each cycle. Lomustine is given on day 1 of cycles 1 and 3 only. Filgrastim (granulocyte colony-stimulating factor; G-CSF) is given subcutaneously on days 5-21 and 33-42 of each cycle.

Patients who have disease progression after one cycle of therapy or at any time thereafter are taken off the study. Patients with a complete response after 1 cycle of therapy receive 2 additional cycles of chemotherapy and are observed off treatment. Patients with a partial response (PR) also receive 2 additional cycles of chemotherapy. Following the third cycle of chemotherapy, if residual disease is confined to 1 or 2 nodal sites, patients receive radiation therapy. All other patients with a PR are treated at investigator's discretion.

Title: Comprehensive Nutritional Support for Children in Zambia (ZamCNC) - A Pilot Investigation

Status: ACTIVE_NOT_RECRUITING


Brief Summary:
In a recently completed intervention study, more than 50% of children in Lusaka were found to be stunted by age two, even when nutritional supplements were provided. It seems likely that these high rates of stunting are primarily due to inadequate basic nutritional intake. The main goal of this project is investigate this conjecture through a small pilot study that will be conducted in the urban area of Lusaka.

Title: A Non-inferiority Study on Dose Reduction of Adalimumab in Psoriasis Patients

Status: TERMINATED


Brief Summary:
The optimal therapeutic serum trough level (Ctrough) of adalimumab was defined between 3,5 and 7,0 µg/ml in patients with plaque type psoriasis. An adalimumab Ctrough above this therapeutic range did not add clinical response. Based on this therapeutic window, the introduction of dose adjustments based on Ctroughs (therapeutic drug monitoring) will be further validated in a prospective randomized-controlled trial. Here, we aim to determine whether, in patients with a good clinical response and supratherapeutic adalimumab Ctroughs, dose reduction is able to maintain favorable clinical outcome.


Detailed Description:
Patients will be included after signing informed consent and randomized in either a standard dose arm or a concentration based arm based on prior Ctrough measurements. In the concentration based arm, dosing frequency will be lowered to once every 3 weeks. If patients still have supratherapeutic Ctroughs of adalimumab, these patients will continue adalimumab self-administration every 4 weeks. In the standard based arm, patients will continue on standard dosing schedule. During each study visit blood will be taken in order to quantify Ctroughs. In addition, Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) and Investigator's Global Assessment (IGA) score will be evaluated by a physician. Patients complete the Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) and European quality of life EQ-5D instrument at each visit. In addition, in a subset of patients in each treatment arm, additional sampling will be collected by dried blood spot sampling in order to build a PK(PD) model for adalimumab.


Eligibility Criteria:
Inclusion Criteria:

1. Participants must have a clinical or histological diagnosis of chronic plaque-type psoriasis for at least 6 months prior to inclusion
2. Participants must have a stable disease during maintenance on adalimumab (absolute PASI \< 3)
3. Participants are not allowed to use topical steroids from 7 days before randomization until the end of the study (week 48).
4. Participants must sign an ICF indicating that he or she understands the purpose of, and procedures required for, the study and is willing to participate in the study

Exclusion Criteria:

1. Participants who have currently a predominant nonplaque form of psoriasis
2. Participants who are pregnant, nursing or planning a pregnancy while enrolled in the study or within 12 weeks after receiving the last administration of study intervention

Title: The Role of Muscle Cachexia in Pancreatic Cancer

Status: WITHDRAWN


Brief Summary:
The relationship between myopenia, nutritional status, and long-term oncologic outcomes remains poorly characterized in patients with anatomically resectable pancreatic cancer (PC). The investigators want to look at muscle properties in pancreatic cancer patients to determine possible therapeutic options toward better nutritional status. Patients with benign right upper quadrant pathology will be utilized as controls for the study.

The researchers hypothesize that improving cancer cachexia in PC will improve the quality of life and ultimately increase overall survival. The long term goal of is to identify areas of intervention to prevent and/or improve cachectic events in PC in order to significantly improve clinical outcomes. The first step in this long term goal is to fully characterize cachexia in the condition of PC. This research is to understand and modify the local response within skeletal muscle leading to a clinically relevant persistent wasting and to understand and interrupt the systemic stimulus produced by the tumor local environment resulting in these muscle specific mechanisms.


Detailed Description:
Cancer cachexia (CC) is a devastating condition affecting up to 80% of cancer patients, diminishing quality of life and contributing to increased mortality. Cancer cachexia is a complex metabolic syndrome characterized by the loss of skeletal muscle mass and weakness. The muscle pathology of cancer cachexia is not only related to muscle atrophy but also to disruptions to the contractile apparatus of the muscle. While physiologic disruptions in muscle sarcomere and myofiber membrane integrity have been observed despite the lack of injury, the totality of the muscle specific mechanisms contributing to these phenotypes have not been described, nor investigated in the context of pancreatic cancer (PC) where cachexia is a significant clinical problem. Therefore, delineating specific mechanisms of muscle catabolism in PC is critical to developing clinical therapies to control wasting and improve patient quality of life, clinical outcomes and long-term survival.

A variety of tumor promoting and inflammatory cell signaling pathways have been implicated in cancer cachexia, whereby pro-inflammatory cytokines have been implicated as a driving force. Remarkably, approximately half of all patients with PC demonstrate a measurable acute phase response, which is associated with poor clinical outcomes. Importantly, systemic elevations of these inflammatory mediators are due to a complex local interplay between the developing tumor and the immune system which subsequently leads to a systemic chronic inflammatory state. PC appears to manipulate the immune system to promote its survival at the expense of nutritional stores which results in cachexia."

Title: Predicting Olaparib Sensitivity in Patients With Unresectable Locally Advanced/Metastatic HER2-negative Breast Cancer With BRCA1, BRCA2, PALB2, RAD51C or RAD51D Mutations or RAD51-foci Low Test: RADIOLA TRIAL

Status: UNKNOWN


Brief Summary:
The primary objetive is to assess the capacity of the RAD51-foci score to predict the efficacy of olaparib in BRCA1/2, PALB2 or RAD51C/D mut advanced breast cancer (cohort 1).

The investigators propose the hypothesis that the RAD51-foci low tumours determined by immunofluorescence using RAD51 assay in patients with BRCA1/2, PALB2 \& RAD51C/D mutation (cohort 1) predicts response to olaparib. Furthermore, The investigators posit that the determination of RAD51-foci score in tumour identifies patients who can benefit from olaparib beyond mutations in these 5 genes. This hypothesis will be tested in cohort 2.


Detailed Description:
This is an open-label, single arm, multicentre phase II study evaluating treatment with olaparib in patients with unresectable locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer (MBC) in two cohorts:

1. with mutation in germline/somatic BRCA1/2, PALB2 or RAD51C/D and
2. RAD51-foci low score in wild type HRR tumours or without known deleterious BRCA1/2, PALB2 or RAD51C/D mutations at study entry.

Although efficacy and safety will be investigated. The primary objective consists in identifying a predictive biomarker for clinical benefit of treatment with olaparib.

All patients recruited in the study will be selected based on the following 3 principles:

* Genetic selection:

  * Cohort 1: HER2-negative ABC with documented germline or somatic mutation in BRCA1, BRCA2, PALB2, RAD51C or RAD51D that is predicted to be deleterious or suspected deleterious (known or predicted to be detrimental/lead to loss of function). Patients with BRCA1, BRCA2, PALB2, RAD51C or RAD51D mutations that are considered to be non-detrimental (eg, ""Variants of uncertain clinical significance"" or ""Variant of unknown significance"" or ""Variant, favor polymorphism"" or ""benign polymorphism,"" etc) will not be eligible for this cohort.
  * Cohort 2: HER2-negative ABC with RAD51-foci low score in the most recent locally recurrence or metastatic biopsy and without known or with negative germline or somatic mutation in BRCA1, BRCA2, PALB2, RAD51C or RAD51D predicted to be deleterious or suspected deleterious (known or predicted to be detrimental/lead to loss of function). Mutation status will be assessed in, at least, olaparib responding patients in this subgroup.
* Phenotypic tumour selection: Patients can have either triple-negative breast cancer (defined as ER and PgR negative (IHC nuclear staining \<1%) and HER2 negative (IHC 0, 1+ or 2+ and/or ISH non-amplified with ratio less than 2.0) or ER/PgR positive breast cancer, as long as they are HER2 negative."

Title: Adoptive Immunotherapy Utilizing Activated Marrow Infiltrating Lymphocytes Derived From Patients With Bone Marrow Relapse of Hematologic Malignancies After Allogeneic Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation Using Post-Transplantation Cyclophosphamide Graft-Versus-Host Disease Prophylaxis.

Status: COMPLETED


Brief Summary:
This Phase 1 clinical study is designed to examine the safety and feasibility of using anti-CD3/CD28 activated marrow infiltrating lymphocytes (MILs) as treatment of relapse after allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (alloHCT) for patients with hematologic malignancies with bone marrow involvement of their relapsed disease. These MILs will be derived from the bone marrow of the relapsed patient who had previously received post-transplantation cyclophosphamide (PTCy) as graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis (PTCy-MILs). A bone marrow aspiration will be performed on the patient to collect \~200ml of marrow for ex vivo expansion. During this expansion process, T cells will be activated and expanded by co-stimulation with anti-CD3/anti-CD28 monoclonal antibodies covalently attached to super-paramagnetic microbeads. Patients will be treated with salvage therapy while this ex vivo expansion is ongoing. After the simultaneous salvage therapy and ex vivo expansion, the activated PTCy-MILs will be reinfused. Patients will be monitored with the primary objective being the feasibility of expanding to targeted dose levels activated PTCy-MILs that do not cause grade III-IV acute GVHD within the first 90 days after PTCy-MIL infusion.

Title: An EXErcise Regimen Designed to Improve Body Composition, Functional Capacity, and Strength After Treatment for Breast Cancer with Nutrition Optimization

Status: COMPLETED


Brief Summary:
This protocol seeks to analyze patient outcomes of the standard of care, monitored group exercise regimen of high-load resistance training and functional exercises with compound movements in conjunction with a nutrition regimen focused on food quality under close supervision on women who have been treated for breast cancer.


Detailed Description:
Excess adipose tissue is a risk factor for the diagnosis of breast cancer and is also associated with an increased risk of disease recurrence.1 Additionally weight gain during and after treatment for breast cancer is associated with a higher risk of recurrence, distant metastases, and death.2 More specifically, low muscle mass and increased adipose tissue is associated with poorer outcomes after the treatment of breast cancer.3 Yet, most women gain significant weight during and after breast cancer treatment, potentially compromising outcomes.

Effective methods to promote weight loss and improve metabolic and hormonal dysregulation, inflammation, and body composition in the breast cancer setting are urgently needed. In the noncancer setting, the promotion of high-quality diets that avoided processed food and simple carbohydrates in the DIETFITS study promoted weight loss4. However, this dietary strategy and others were utilized to result in weight loss, but do not necessarily consider maximizing body composition, i.e., muscle mass preservation or increase, and adipose tissue loss.

The major, and some would consider only, non-pharmacological method to increase muscle mass is via resistance training with an adequate stimulus and quantity to elicit and promote hypertrophy.5 Our group has already shown that profound muscle hypertrophy is attainable in a population of women undergoing treatment for breast cancer, particularly when the dose threshold of load and repetitions is met. At interim analysis, this program revealed a 2 lb. increase in muscle mass and a 6 lb. decrease in adipose tissue after a 3 month program utilizing linear progression.

Based on the DIEFITS protocol which has been described as a ""healthy low-carbohydrate"" diet, participants will be advised to eat nutrient dense food sources high in vitamins, minerals, and nutrients. Participants will be told to limit processed foods, sugar, bread, pasta, and other simple carbohydrates. Participants will be advised to eat plenty of colorful and nonstarchy vegetables. Finally, participants will be told to avoid snacking between meals, cook most/all meals, eat with family and friends, avoid eating food in the car or on the run, and focus on whole foods that require preparation. This protocol resulted in significant weight loss at one year."

Title: Early Alirocumab to Reduce LDL-C in Myocardial Infarction

Status: WITHDRAWN


Brief Summary:
The EARLY trial is a phase IV, investigator initiated, international, multicentre study that will investigate if early use of alirocumab 150mg plus atorvastatin 80mg (enhanced care) will have a greater effect than atorvastatin 80mg (standard care) on the reduction of LDL-C at 2-weeks after a myocardial infarction (MI), in patients who start treatment within 24 hours of symptom onset.

A secondary goal is to assess the effects of enhanced care when compared to standard care which is either atorvastatin alone or atorvastatin plus ezetimibe, (the latter added at 4 weeks if LDL-C is ≥ 70mg/dL (1.8mmol/L), on the proportion of patients achieving an LDL-C goal of \< 50mg/dL (1.29 mmol/L) at 7 weeks after an MI.


Detailed Description:
Patients with Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS), which includes myocardial infarction, are at high risk of recurrent ischaemic events (e.g. heart attacks), and death. The current standard treatment includes high dose statins to lower low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), also known as bad cholesterol, soon after admission. In some cases, following assessment after 1-3 months, administration of a second line cholesterol lowering therapy (ezetimibe) may be added if LDL-C levels remain high ≥ 70mg/dL (1.8mmol/L). Many guidelines advocate that following ACS high dose statins should be used as first line therapy. If LDL-C levels remain greater than 70mg/dL (1.8mmol/L) then additional add on therapy on statins could be considered for ACS patients.

Consented patients meeting the eligibility criteria for the EARLY trial will be randomised to enhanced care or standard care within 24hrs of symptom onset for MI. Patients randomised to enhanced care will receive alirocumab 150 mg on randomisation and then every 2 weeks during a 7-week treatment period. All patients will receive atorvastatin 80 mg. Patients randomised to standard care with an LDL-C level ≥ 70mg/dL (1.8mmol/L) at week 4 will receive ezetimibe 10 mg, in addition to atorvastatin 80 mg for the remaining duration of the treatment period.

All patients will be followed up for a two-week period after completing the 7-week treatment period (i.e. a total of 9 weeks to assess safety).


Eligibility Criteria:
Inclusion Criteria:

* Males or females aged 18 years or above
* Admitted to hospital for ST-Segment Elevation MI (STEMI) or non-ST-Segment Elevation MI (NSTEMI) (proven by electrocardiogram (ECG) or biomarker evidence of MI)

Title: Shockwave Lithotripsy (SWL) Versus Oral Dissolution Therapy (ODT) Versus Combined SWL And ODT For Radiolucent Renal Stone Randomised Controlled Trial

Status: COMPLETED


Brief Summary:
compare the efficacy of of ultrasound guided SWL versus dissolution therapy versus combined SWL and dissolution therapy in management of 1 - 2.5 cm renal stones.


Detailed Description:
Urolithiasis is a common morbidity worldwide, affecting 10% to 15% of the population in Europe and North America. A higher prevalence of stone disease is found in hot or dry areas, including 20% to 25% in the Middle East. Radiolucent stones are mostly uric acid (UA) calculi, which varies geographically with worldwide incidence ranges from 5 to 40% and about 7- 10 percent of all calculi. Other rare radiolucent stones include xanthine and 2,8-dihydroxyadenine calculi.

The main etiologic factors for the development of uric acid nephrolithiasis are low urinary pH, hyperuricosuria, and low urinary volume. Practically, all of those who form uric acid stones have persistently low urinary pH, and most excrete normal amounts of uric acid. This suggests the potential importance of urinary pH manipulation in dissolving UA stones. Dissolution therapy for UA calculi is based on hydration and raising the urinary pH. European guidelines recommended that urine pH should be increased to a level above 6. The early published papers discussed the efficacy of oral chemo-dissolution therapy reporting high success rates. Since that era, there have been only a few publications, with widely variable results (15-80% complete dissolution rate).

Retrograde intrarenal surgery (RIRS), shockwave lithotripsy (SWL), and percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL) are the three main non-medical modalities for treating medium-sized renal stones. Resorlu et al., retrospectively compare the outcomes of SWL, PNL, and RSIS for 10-20 mm radiolucent renal calculi of 437 patients and concluded that success rates ""defined as stone-free status or asymptomatic insignificant residual fragments \<3 mm."" were 66.5, 91.4, and 87 % for SWL, PNL, and RIRS (p\<0.001). in a prospective randomized of 135 patient with 1 to 2 cm radiolucent lower calyceal renal calculi, the 3-month stone-free rate of SWL, RIRS and miniperc was 73.8%, 86.1% and 95.1%, respectively (p =0.01).

Comparing the medical in the form of dissolution therapy versus non-medical in the form of SWL, Elderwy et al, in a prospective study on 87 children with radiolucent renal calculi with length less than 25 mm and a normal upper urinary tract or grade I HN, found that stone-free rate was 72.9% for dissolution therapy vs 82.1% after a single session of shock wave lithotripsy (p = 0.314).

Dissolution success is related to stone size as well as compliance. Larger stones demand longer therapy, and in these cases SWL may increase treatment efficacy by increasing stone surface area. So when Mokhless et al."

Title: Speed of Processing Training to Improve Cognition in Multiple Sclerosis: A Randomized Clinical Trial

Status: COMPLETED


Brief Summary:
The purpose of this research study is to investigate the effectiveness of a computerized technique designed to improve processing speed (i.e. the amount of time it takes for a person's brain to process information) in a multiple sclerosis (MS) population. The study is designed to study how well this technique can help people with MS increase their processing speed and their ability to function better in everyday life. This treatment protocol has been studied extensively with older adults, showing improvements on standard laboratory measures of processing speed and performance of activities of daily living.


Detailed Description:
This study is a double-blind, placebo-control randomized clinical trial examining the efficacy of Speed of Processing Training (SPT) for improving processing speed (PS) deficits in persons with Multiple Sclerosis (MS). Slowed PS is one of the most common deficits in individuals with MS and such deficits have been shown to exert significant negative impact on multiple aspects of everyday life, including occupational and social functioning. Despite these findings, few studies have attempted to remediate PS deficits in order to improve the everyday functioning of individuals with MS. This study is designed to (1) apply a treatment protocol for PS impairments well-validated in an aging population to individuals with MS with objectively observable deficits in PS and document its efficacy on standard neuropsychological outcome measures. In addition, the investigators will (2) assess the effectiveness of the intervention utilizing global measures of everyday life, including an objective measure (the Timed Activities of Daily Living; TIADL), as well as additional questionnaires to be completed by both the participant and a significant other. This study is also designed to (3) examine the influence of degree of PS impairment on treatment efficacy using neuropsychological tests, (4) evaluate the long-term effects of the treatment protocol and (5) examine the utility of booster sessions to facilitate long-term treatment effects.

Title: A Study on Association Between Homologous Recombination Genes and the Homologous Recombination Deficiency Status in Chinese Population With Epithelial Ovarian Cancer

Status: COMPLETED


Brief Summary:
The association between homologous recombination (HR) gene mutations and homologous recombination deficiency (HRD) status in Chinese epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) patients is little known. This study would recruit 400 Chinese EOC patients with known targeted gene mutations via a multi-panel testing of 27 genes, including BRCA1/BRCA2. All patients accept evaluation of HRD model, which is based on the loss of heterozygosity (LOH), telomere allele imbalance (TAI) and large-scale state transitions (LST). The mutated genes, HRD score model and their relationship with the prognosis, would provide a full description of for the Chinese EOC patients, and a potential explanation of platinum-resistance in such population.

Title: Building Electronic Tools To Enhance and Reinforce CArdiovascular REcommendations - Heart Failure (BETTER CARE-HF)

Status: COMPLETED


Brief Summary:
Building Electronic Tools To Enhance and Reinforce CArdiovascular REcommendations - Heart Failure (BETTER CARE-HF) is a pragmatic, cluster-randomized, three-arm intervention trial that will compare the effectiveness of two targeted clinical decision support (CDS) intervention tools (best practice alert (BPA) and automated in-basket massage) to inform providers when a patient with heart failure and reduce ejection fraction (HFrEF) is not on appropriate medical therapy, as compared to usual care.


Detailed Description:
An estimated 68,000 deaths per year nationwide can be attributed to gaps in care for patients with heart failure and reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), with the majority being due to lack of mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRA). Despite proven benefits in randomized trials, class I guideline recommendations, and published clinical performance measures, patients with HFrEF are often not on guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT). While successful interventions for improvement in prescription of GDMT have often included multidisciplinary approaches with dedicated staff, the relatively high cost of hiring additional personnel has led to an interest in electronic health record (EHR)-based interventions. Prior studies on EHR-based interventions in this arena have mainly been conducted in the inpatient setting, which is limited to one encounter during acute hospitalization, a setting often complicated by renal dysfunction or hypotension that can limit prescription of MRA. The development and study of outpatient EHR-based alerts for HFrEF GDMT are needed. Two types of outpatient EHR-based interventions include best practice alerts (BPA) and automated in-basket messages. Both of these methods have limited data, with some studies showing benefit and others demonstrating provider fatigue and burnout. To our knowledge, there is no study that has directly compared these different types of EHR-based interventions.

BETTER CARE - HF is a pragmatic, cluster-randomized, three-arm intervention trail that will compare the effectiveness of two targeted CDS intervention tools (BPA and automated in-basket message) as compared to usual care on the primary outcome of MRA prescription at end of study period.

Title: Research on Community Cancer Control: Study of Colorectal Cancer Screening in the African American Population

Status: COMPLETED


Brief Summary:
Colorectal cancer is the second deadliest among cancers and disproportionately affects African Americans. The Colorectal Cancer Screening Intervention Trial(CCSIT) project has as its goal to test three interventions designed to increase screening rates among medically underserved African Americans in the Metropolitan Atlanta area. It is designed to increase awareness of modifiable risk factors and promote the benefits of screening as a means of early detection of colorectal cancer. mportance of being screened for colorectal cancer,African Americans continue to be disproportionately affected by this disease. The Colorectal Cancer Screening


Detailed Description:
Despite increased awareness of the importance of being screened for colorectal cancer, African Americans continue to be disproportionately affected by this disease. The Colorectal Cancer Screening Intervention Trial (CCSIT) is designed to test and expand a public health intervention that combines social marketing and community-coalition building efforts.

The purpose of this study is to 1) evaluate the effects of three different approaches on knowledge, attitudes and beliefs (KABs) about colorectal cancer; 2) to examine the effects of three different approaches to adherence to screening guidelines and 3) to evaluate the independent role of setting on screening practices.

Participants age 50 and over are recruited from churches, clinics and senior sites which allows us to examine the impact of setting on participant recruitment and changes to KAB. Pre and post questionnaires are administered to determine the knowledge attitudes and behaviors (KAB) related to screening and to measure psychosocial parameters (self-esteem, perceived stress and social support). These persons are randomized into one of four groups, the control group and three intervention arms: (1) one-on-one counseling sessions, (2) small group educational sessions and (3) financial incentives interventions where out of pocket cost for screening is reimbursed. The counseling and educational interventions incorporate the Health Belief Model and Social Learning Theory.

Title: Normothermic Versus Hypothermic Cardiopulmonary Bypass in Adult Cardiac Surgery: a Multicentre Feasibility Randomised Controlled Trial

Status: RECRUITING


Brief Summary:
In order to perform heart surgery, a machine called cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB), or more commonly known as a heart-lung machine, is used to maintain the circulation of oxygenated blood needed by the rest of the body and its organs.

Historically, when a patient is connected to CPB, their body is cooled below the normal body temperature. This is known as hypothermia. This is because scientific studies have previously shown that reduced body temperature lowers metabolism and therefore offers more protection to the brain and other organs due to the reduced oxygen requirement. The evidence supporting this practice, however, has been challenged throughout the history of cardiac surgery, with studies supporting that normothermia, or normal body temperature, is a safe alternative. Despite this, the practice of hypothermia has persisted. Published data from a survey of 139 cardiac surgeons in the United Kingdom showed that 84% still routinely employ hypothermic CPB during surgery.

To assess whether normothermic or hypothermic CPB is safer, a clinical trial requiring a large sample size and high recruitment rates will be required. Therefore, the investigators aim to assess firstly the feasibility of trial recruitment and allocation adherence in this study. 100 adults across 10 different cardiac surgery centres in the United Kingdom will be recruited to a multicentre feasibility randomised controlled trial comparing normothermia (active comparator) against hypothermia (control comparator) during cardiopulmonary bypass in cardiac surgery. This study will also test the ability of the Cardiothoracic Interdisciplinary Research Network (CIRN), a trainee-led research collaborative, to collect pilot data on Major Adverse Cardiac and Cerebrovascular Events (MACCE) using a regulation-approved electronic application HealthBitⓇ. Participants will also be asked to complete quality of life surveys. The results of this study will subsequently inform a large, adequately powered randomised controlled trial for optimal temperature management during CPB.


Detailed Description:
Primary Objective

To assess the feasibility of trial recruitment and delivery to target in the United Kingdom of a multicentre randomised controlled trial on normothermia versus hypothermia during cardiopulmonary bypass in adult cardiac surgery.

Secondary Objective

To assess the feasibility of conducting a multicentre randomized controlled trial (RCT) using a novel Good Clinical Practice (GCP) approved remote data capture as the primary trial database alongside analysis of routinely collected healthcare data."

Title: The Crosstalk Between Calcium-sensing Receptor Signaling and Endocannabinoid System in Primary Hyperparathyroidism

Status: COMPLETED


Brief Summary:
Despite the strong association of hyperparathyroidism with arachidonic acid related lipid signals, little research has been performed over the years. A better understanding of the link between arachidonic acid remodeling, prostaglandin and endocannabinoid production with primary hyperparathyroidism in primary tissue/cells might open up new avenues for biomarker and thus to a potential therapeutic target.

Arachidonic acid remodeling might also have an impact on depression and elevated cytokines in patients with primary hyperparathyroidism. The investigators therefore will assess the correlation between postoperative improvement of PHQ-9 and cytokine levels with arachidonic acid remodeling.

Title: Preliminary Clinical Study of Ultrasound to Measure Enamel Thickness

Status: COMPLETED


Brief Summary:
The investigators have now established a technique to measure enamel thickness which has been shown to work well in-vitro. The teeth tested so far, obtained from the Dental School Tissue Bank, have been molars or pre-molars. In these cases, the measurement is made more difficult by the curvature of the tooth surface and it seems likely that flatter larger, incisors would give more satisfactory results. The investigators therefore wish to establish in-vivo whether this hypothesis is correct.


Detailed Description:
The aim is translate our research into a clinical hand-held dental tool that could be used to measure enamel thickness in less curvaceous anterior incisor (front) teeth, and ultimately monitor erosive tooth surface loss (TSL), which mainly occurs on anterior (front) teeth and the occlusal (top) surface of posterior (back) teeth. In this study, quantifying enamel thickness with ultrasound will provide data which will be assessed for reproducibility and to determine whether or not ultrasound is a potentially viable tool to measure and monitor acid erosion of teeth. This would allow dentists to reinforce advice to patients to reduce acidic consumption, and will motivate them to keep whatever is remaining of their 'precious' enamel tissue, which if lost, will necessitate fillings to be made. These fillings will require future repairs and possible remakes, as they have median survival rates of five years.


Eligibility Criteria:
Inclusion Criteria:

1. Healthy adults over 18 years (females and males) with normal salivary flow.
2. Volunteers with absence of dental caries and/or periodontal disease on the maxillary incisors (upper front teeth) to be used in the study.
3. Volunteers should have sound maxillary incisors with no obvious cracks in the crown.
4. Volunteers who willingly signed an informed consent.
5. Volunteers who are willing to follow the research schedule for the period of the study.

Exclusion Criteria:

1. Volunteers with abnormal enamel on maxillary incisors assessed by visual inspection.
2. Volunteers with replaced enamel on maxillary incisors (eg fillings, crowns, bridges).
3. Volunteers who appear to have hypoplastic teeth as part of a syndrome, e.g. osteogenesis imperfect.
4. Volunteers having orthodontic appliances on front teeth, or presence of fixed or removable dentures (replacing missing front teeth).
5. Volunteers who have a complex dental history such as periodontitis, dentine sensitivity or salivary dysfunction.
6. Volunteers who have any condition could be expected to interfere with the volunteer's safety during the study.
7. Volunteers who demonstrate an inability to comply with study procedures.

Title: Senolytics to Improve Physical and Cognitive Function in Older Adults With Multiple Sclerosis

Status: NOT_YET_RECRUITING


Brief Summary:
This is a clinical trial to see whether senolytic therapy is safe and feasible for patients with secondary progressive MS and whether treatment improves physical and thinking abilities. The study seeks to enroll adults with secondary progressive MS (SPMS), aged 50-85, who are not currently taking a MS disease-modifying therapy and have noticed their MS symptoms getting worse. People who join the study will take the medicines dasatinib and quercetin by mouth every two weeks for three months. These medicines work together to remove old, damaged cells that may cause inflammation and slow the repair of nerves. Participants will also be followed for one year from enrollment to monitor for treatment effects.


Detailed Description:
Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic immune-mediated inflammatory and neurodegenerative disorder of the central nervous system (CNS), which afflicts approximately one million people in the United States. Age is the strongest driver of disease course in MS. With increasing age, most older adults with MS develop a progressive disease phenotype characterized by gradual accrual of irreversible neurological disability, for which there are no effective treatments that reliably slow disease progression. Cellular senescence is a hallmark of aging, whereby senescent cells accumulate with age and produce mediators of inflammation through the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP). In MS, senescent cells have been identified in both the central nervous system and peripheral immune compartments contributing to SASP expression, promoting chronic inflammation, axonal damage, and failure of myelin repair, and ultimately leading to functional decline. Senescent cells can be selectively removed by senolytic drugs, which delay age-related dysfunction in animal models and show potential for improving functional outcomes in human clinical trials. The senolytic drug combination of dasatinib and quercetin (D+Q) selectively induces apoptosis of senescent cells in human tissue. Our pilot data shows D+Q treatment improves function and survival in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, the widely used animal model of MS. Emerging evidence from early phase clinical trials of D+Q in age-related diseases shows improvement of gait speed in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and CNS penetrance of dasatinib in Alzheimer's disease. However, studies of senolytic therapy for people with MS have yet to be conducted. The investigators hypothesize that treatment with D+Q will be well tolerated, improve physical and cognitive function, reduce circulating biomarkers of senescence and neurodegeneration, and attenuate T-cell immune exhaustion."

If the anatomy of muscles, joints, ligaments and circulatory system is mastered and the correct techniques appropriate to the situation are used, the chance of success of the technique increases. Lymphatic correction technique is used to reorganize damaged lymphatic circulation. The main goals are to create a dead space in the tissue that allows circulation and to reduce the pressure on the lymph vessels at the tissue level. It directs lymph fluid to larger lymphatic vessels and lymph nodes. This effect can be explained by the elastic qualities and lifting effect of the tape."

Title: Co-administration of Acetaminophen With Ibuprofen to Improve Duct-Related Outcomes in Extremely Premature Infants - The ACEDUCT Trial

Status: RECRUITING


Brief Summary:
Patent ductus arteriosus (PDA), the most common cardiovascular complication of prematurity, is associated with higher mortality and morbidities in extremely low gestational age neonates (ELGANs, \< 27+0 weeks). Ibuprofen and acetaminophen, which act by reducing prostaglandin synthesis, are the most commonly used first and second line agents for PDA treatment across Canada. However, initial treatment failure with monotherapy is a major problem, occurring in \>60% ELGANs. Treatment failure is associated with worsening rates of mortality and bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), while early treatment success can achieve rates comparable to neonates without PDA. Treatment failure resulting in prolonged disease exposure is thought to be a major contributor. Recently, combination therapy with acetaminophen and ibuprofen has emerged as a new treatment regime. Acetaminophen exerts anti-prostaglandin effect through a different receptor site than ibuprofen, providing a biological rationale for their synergistic action.

The objective of this study is to evaluate the clinical impact, efficacy and safety of combination regime (Ibuprofen + IV Acetaminophen) for the first treatment course for PDA in ELGANs vs. Ibuprofen alone (current standard treatment).

Title: High-dose HMG-CoA Inhibitor Simvastatin for Patients With Relapsed CLL: Pilot Trial and Pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic Studies

Status: COMPLETED


Brief Summary:
The primary aim of this trial is to generate a preliminary analysis of this novel therapeutic approach and laboratory studies for patients with recurrent or refractory CLL. Further, this pilot trial will demonstrate the feasibility of the translational science methods proposed for this new collaboration of investigators. The investigators hypothesize that patients with relapsed CLL are recruitable to this study, that the methods for measuring simvastatin concentration and target protein translation are feasible, and that the investigators can efficiently apply the laboratory research methods to patient blood samples before and after patients have taken the study medication.


Eligibility Criteria:
Eligibility Criteria:

* Patients must have histologically or cytologically confirmed chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Criteria for diagnosis are as per the WHO classification of hematologic tumors (Jaffe 2001). As per the 1996 NCI guidelines for CLL ""\[second-line or later\] treatment of CLL is generally palliative in intent; therefore, patients who have relapsed may be followed without therapy until they experience disease-related symptoms or progressive disease, with deterioration of blood counts, discomfort from lymphadenopathy or hepatosplenomegaly, recurrent infections, or associated autoimmune disorders"" (Cheson 1996).
* Age \>18 years. Because no dosing or adverse event data are currently available on the use of high-dose simvastatin in patients \<18 years of age, children are excluded from this study.
* Life expectancy of greater than 6 months.
* ECOG performance status #2 or better.
* Patients must have normal organ and marrow function as defined below:

  * total bilirubin within normal institutional limits unless resulting from documented hemolysis
  * AST(SGOT)/ALT(SGPT) ≤1.5 X institutional upper limit of normal
  * creatinine ≤ 1.5 institutional upper limit of normal OR
  * creatinine clearance \>60 mL/min/1.73 m2 for patients with creatinine levels above institutional normal
  * Creatine phosphokinase ≤ 1.5 institutional upper limit of normal
* Patients with active infections requiring systemic antibiotics should be excluded until resolution of infection
* The effects simvastatin on the developing human fetus at the studied therapeutic dose are unknown. For this reason and because HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors may be teratogenic, women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration of study participation. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately."

Title: Diagnostic Performance of Combined Assays for Gastrin-17, Pepsinogen and Anti-helicobacter Pylori Antibodies for Diagnosing Gastric Atrophy.

Status: NOT_YET_RECRUITING


Brief Summary:
This research study is taking place to find out if a simple blood test can diagnose inflammation in the stomach. Prolonged inflammation in the stomach can lead to Ulcers and even Cancer in the long run.

Currently, a camera test is needed to identify inflammation in the stomach. The method being tested in this study may be able to do this using just a pinprick of blood.

If this test proves to be good at diagnosing inflammation in the stomach with just a pinprick of blood, it may be used in the future to decide who actually needs to have a full camera test done or not. This could really improve the waiting lists for these camera tests in the future. It may also mean that we can identify problems at an earlier stage.


Detailed Description:
Gastric atrophy (GA), also referred to as atrophic gastritis, is a pre-neoplastic lesion in the development of intestinal-type gastric cancer (GC). It is defined as the loss of the normal glandular architecture of the stomach. It forms part of the so-called ""Correa cascade"", first described in 1988. This cascade posits that intestinal-type GC develops along a defined pathway of pre-neoplastic lesions. The initiation of this pathway is triggered by chronic inflammation affecting the gastric mucosa. The cause of this chronic inflammation is most commonly Helicobacter Pylori, although chronic autoimmune gastritis accounts for a minority of cases. The chronic inflammation over time causes the loss of the normal glandular architecture characteristic of gastric atrophy. With the ongoing presence of the initiating factor and persistence of the chronic inflammatory phenotype, the GA can progress to intestinal-type metaplasia and then to dysplasia and, ultimately, intestinal-type gastric cancer.

The precise risk of progression to GC in those with GA is poorly understood, particularly in lower-risk Western countries such as Ireland. In higher-risk countries such as Japan and South Korea, the reported risk may be as high as 0.1 to 0.3% per year. This is similar to the rates of malignant progression seen in low-risk colorectal adenomas and the risk seen in non-dysplastic Barrett's. This has prompted increased interest in the concept of surveilling patients with GA in the hopes of earlier identification of GC. Indeed, there is evidence to suggest that if Helicobacter Pylori is eradicated in patients with GA, the Correa cascade can be halted, and the risk of developing GC can be greatly reduced.

The British Society of Gastroenterology addressed this issue in their guideline document published in 2019. The guideline addresses several issues concerning managing patients at risk of developing Gastric Adenocarcinoma. Central to this is the concept of managing patients with GA."

The purpose of the present study is to examine the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of cannabigerol (CBG; CHI-914), a naturally occurring chemical constituent of the cannabis plant formulated for oral consumption, in healthy adults. The study will utilize a within-subjects, placebo-controlled, double-blind, ascending-dose design. Oral drug administration will be double blind (the participant and research staff will be unaware of the dose administered; though active doses will be fixed in ascending order, placebo will be randomly assigned). Upon enrollment, participants will complete 5 oral dosing conditions (placebo, 25, 50, 100, and 200 mg CBG). Doses were selected based on current retail CBG products and web-based surveys of CBG use among current CBG product users. Each condition will consist of a single acute drug exposure, followed by an 8-hour period to evaluate acute pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic drug effects. Blood specimens will be obtained throughout these 8 hours to characterize the pharmacokinetics of CBG. Pharmacodynamic assessments including subjective drug effects, cognitive performance testing, and vital signs will also be collected for 8 hours post-drug administration. Experimental test sessions will be separated by at least 1 week to allow for sufficient drug washout between doses.

Title: Prospective Validation of the STOPSHOCK Score - Artificial Intelligence Based Predictive Scoring System to Identify the Risk of Developing Cardiogenic Shock (CS) in Patients Suffering From Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS)

Status: ENROLLING_BY_INVITATION


Brief Summary:
Cardiogenic shock (CS) is a severe complication of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) with mortality approaching 50% despite the use of percutaneous mechanical circulatory support devices (pMCS). Identifying high-risk patients prior to the development of CS could allow pre-emptive use of pMCS possibly preventing CS. For this purpose, we derived and externally validated a machine learning score to predict in-hospital CS in patients with ACS with c-statistics: 0.844 (95% confidence interval, 0.841-0.847). STOPSCHOCK score is available as a web or smartphone application.

The aim of this study is to prospectively validate the STOPSHOCK score on a large cohort of ACS patients in a real- world clinical environment.


Detailed Description:
Cardiogenic shock is a serious life-threatening condition affecting almost 10% of patients suffering from acute coronary syndrome (ACS). When untreated, it can rapidly progress to collapse of circulation and sudden death. Despite recent improvements in diagnostic and treatment options, mortality remains incredibly high, reaching nearly 50%. Currently available mechanical circulatory support devices can replace the function of the heart and/or lungs, thereby essentially eliminating the primary cause. However, cardiogenic shock is not only an isolated decrease in cardiac function but a rapidly progressing multiorgan dysfunction accompanied by severe cellular and metabolic abnormalities. The window for successful treatment is relatively narrow, and when missed, even the elimination of the underlying primary cause is not enough to reverse this vicious circle. The ability to identify high-risk patients prior to the development of shock would allow to take pre-emptive measures, such as the implantation of mechanical circulatory support, and thus prevent the development of shock leading to improved survival. For this purpose, Premedix Academy has developed and validated a predictive scoring system STOP SHOCK (Score TO Predict SHOCK). This scoring system showed better prediction compared to standard models and was accepted to the Late- Breaking Science section at the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) Congress 2024. STOP SHOCK was validated on an external cohort of 5123 ACS patients with area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC AUC) of 0.844 (95% confidence interval: 0.841-0.8470) surpassing other externally validated cardiogenic shock (CS) models (e.g. ORBI score). Furthermore, our model is based on variables that are readily available at the first contact with patients and thus STOPSHOCK can be utilized in emergency room (ER) or ambulance even before catheterization."

Title: Correlation in Hispanics of Accelerated Metabolic Risk Profile and Non-ischemic Heart Failure (CHAMP-HF)

Status: WITHDRAWN


Brief Summary:
The investigators aim to examine how medical conditions that indicate high cardiometabolic risk, such as increased body weight, high cholesterol levels and high blood pressure, affect heart structure and function among individuals with known HF. Furthermore, this study is being undertaken to identify potential differences in these effects between non-Hispanics whites and Mexican Americans.


Detailed Description:
While it is known that Mexican Americans are inordinately affected by metabolic syndrome (MetS), it is unclear how metabolic risk factors impact left ventricular structure and function in Mexican Americans with HF. There is also a gap in the knowledge of the principal etiology of HF in this ethnic group. The overall objective of this pilot study is to define the association between MetS and and non-ischemic HF in Mexican Americans. Our central hypothesis is that there is a positive graded association between an increasing number of metabolic risk factors (ie. individual components of MetS) and increasingly compromised LV structure and function in this population, independent of blood pressure and CAD. Additionally, we hypothesize that this association is more pronounced than that seen in non-Hispanic whites suggesting a predominant role of MetS on HF among Mexican Americans. The rationale that underlies the proposed research is that, once the association between metabolic risk factors and HF in this ethnic group is defined, future research on the impact of management of these metabolic risk factors on HF outcomes, both among Mexican Americans and in the larger population, will be advanced.


Eligibility Criteria:
Inclusion Criteria:

1. age 18-59 years
2. known diagnosis of HF
3. complete 2-dimensional and Doppler echocardiogram within the last 12 months.

Exclusion Criteria:

1. history of CAD determined by recorded or self-reported history of CAD and/or revascularization
2. recent history (previous 6 months) of decompensated HF

Title: Comparison For Ease Of Spinal Positioning & Duration Of Post-Op Analgesia Between Ultrasound Guided Supra-Inguinal Fascia Iliaca Block Vs Ultrasound Guided Infra-Inguinal Fascia Iliaca Block In Patients Undergoing Thigh & Knee Surgeries

Status: RECRUITING


Brief Summary:
Severe pain associated with thigh and knee fractures makes the positioning for regional anesthesia a challenge. Different modalities to make patient pain free for spinal positioning, post op analgesia and patient satisfaction including supra-inguinal fascia iliaca block (S-FIB) and infra-inguinal fascia iliaca blocks (I-FIB) have been studies. The aim of this study is to compare two blocks in patients undergoing thigh and knee surgeries.

A randomized controlled trial study design will be used and 60 patients fulfilling the inclusion criteria will be included. The patients will be divided into 2 groups by simple random sampling. Group A (S-FIB) (n = 30, those who will receive 30 ml of 0.125% bupivacaine) and Group B (I-FIB) (n = 30, those who will receive 30 ml of 0.125% bupivacaine). Depending on the allotted group, patients will be given the block under the guidance of ultrasound in the preoperative area. After block patients will be assessed for ease of spinal positioning using EOSP Scale, postoperative duration of analgesia and patient satisfaction using Likert Scale and data will be recorded on prescribed proforma.

All the findings will be noted in a specially designed proforma by the researcher. All the data collected will be entered and analyzed. Quantitative variables will be presented with mean ± SD. Independent sample t-test for duration of postoperative analgesia. Qualitative variables such as ease of spinal positioning and gender will be presented with Chi-Square. A p-value equal to or less than 0.05 will be considered significant.


Detailed Description:
Patients fulfilling the inclusion criteria will be included. Patients will be optimized for dressing. A detailed history will be taken regarding the mode of injury, any pre-existing disease and previous surgery followed by the local examination of the patient will be done to rule out any systemic disease. Informed consent will be taken. These patients will be divided into 2 groups by Computer-generated random numbers and group assignment will be done by sequentially numbered opaque envelopes. The envelope will be opened just before the procedure by the anaesthesiologist performing the block. The observer (another anaesthesiologist) and patients will be unaware of the group and procedure performed.

Title: Brain Stimulation Study of Human Cognition Using Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS)

Status: WITHDRAWN


Brief Summary:
This study will use repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) (a way to use a powerful magnet to cause temporary impairment to the function of a brain region) to test whether certain parts of the brain are necessary to various aspects of memory and emotion. Participation will require up to three visits. One visit will take up to an hour, and the other visits will each take up to three hours each. During the first visit, participants will be consented, and their brains will be scanned using magnetic resonance imaging.


Detailed Description:
Memory and emotion are complex cognitive processes. To understand memory and emotion better, it is helpful to break them down into component processes and examine how each of these component processes is supported by brain. One way to do this is to safely and reversibly impair the function of a brain region that are believed to support some of these component processes and observe changes in behavior.

A high-resolution three-dimensional image of a participant's brain will be created using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanning (about 10 minutes in the scanner). Either the same day or on a following day, participants will return and will be exposed to emotional and/or neutral stimuli. Either before or after being exposed to the stimuli, the participants will have their brain mildly stimulated using rTMS. This stimulation will be at or below the levels which the FDA has deemed safe for treatment of depression, and will temporarily reduce brain activity in the targeted area. The behavior of the participant's memory, emotional processing, or related cognitive functions will be tested by asking them questions about emotional and/or neutral stimuli. Depending on which condition the participant is part of, the researchers may then bring the participant back, and repeat this procedure on a different day stimulating another brain region.

Up to 80 participants will be identified via word of mouth, the psychology department research pool, and via flyers posted on Emory campus. Participants will give informed consent to participate and will be compensated for their time.

Title: CSP #577 - Colonoscopy vs. Fecal Immunochemical Testing in Reducing Mortality From Colorectal Cancer

Status: ACTIVE_NOT_RECRUITING


Brief Summary:
Colorectal cancer (CRC) is currently the second most common cause of cancer death in the United States, and one of the most preventable cancers. It has been shown in several randomized controlled trials that screening using fecal occult blood testing (FOBT) reduces CRC mortality by 13-33%. While there is strong consensus amongst experts regarding the value of CRC screening, the best approach to screening is not clear. Of the widely recommended modalities, FOBT and colonoscopy are the most commonly used within the United States. FOBT is inexpensive, non-invasive, and its use as a screening tool is supported by the highest quality evidence (i.e. randomized controlled trials). Moreover, newer FOBT, such as fecal immunochemical tests or FITs, have advantages over conventional FOBT in terms of both test characteristics and ease of use that make them quite attractive as a population-based screening tool.

While colonoscopy is invasive and has higher up-front risks and costs than FOBT, it does afford the opportunity to directly assess the colonic mucosa and is widely believed to be the best test to detect colorectal cancer. In addition, colonoscopy allows for the detection and removal of colorectal adenomas -a well recognized colorectal cancer precursor. There is indirect evidence that suggests colonoscopy is effective in reducing colorectal cancer mortality, but to date, no large clinical trials have been completed to support this assumption. While colonoscopy use is increasing, data is emerging that colonoscopy may not be as effective as previously believed. Prior support for colonoscopy as a screening test relied upon effectiveness estimates that now appear to be overly optimistic. Given the invasive nature of colonoscopy, the associated small, but real risk of complications, and dramatically higher costs than other screening tests, it is especially important to determine the true comparative effectiveness of colonoscopy relative to other proven non-invasive options.

The investigators propose to perform a, large, simple, multicenter, randomized, parallel group trial directly comparing screening colonoscopy with annual FIT screening in average risk individuals. The hypothesis is that colonoscopy will be superior to FIT in the prevention of colorectal cancer mortality measured over 10 years. Individuals will be enrolled if they are currently eligible for CRC screening (e.g. no colonoscopy in the past 10 years and no FOBT in the past 1 year) and are between 50 and 75 years of age. The investigators will exclude individuals for whom colonoscopy is indicated (e.g. signs or symptoms of CRC, first degree family member with CRC, personal history of colorectal neoplasia or inflammatory bowel disease)."

Title: A Single Center, Prospective, Randomized, Sham Controlled, Double Blind, Split Face Trial Using Micro-injections of Transparent Hyaluronic Acid Gel (Restylane® Silk) for Rejuvenation of the Aging Cheek

Status: UNKNOWN


Brief Summary:
Soft tissue augmentation with injectable hyaluronic acid (HA) is a well-established modality for the correction of facial volume loss, fat atrophy, fine lines, and wrinkles. HA is a glycosaminoglycan that is composed of repeating D-glucuronic acid and D-N-acetylglucosamine disaccharide units. Because HA is a natural and inert constituent of the dermis, it represents an ideal substance for soft tissue augmentation. Current FDA-approved HA fillers are typically utilized to either directly target specific cutaneous rhytids or to restore overall contours by placement into fat pads or along bony structures that have remodeled with age. Restylane® Silk is a transparent injectable HA gel that received FDA approval in June 2014 for use in the lips and peri-oral region. Its unique synthesis results in smaller and finer particles that demonstrate significant hygroscopic properties and give rise to the potential for unique applications. One such application concerns the concept of ""skin boosting"" whereby microaliquots of HA are placed into the skin to induce biophysical improvement in dermal characteristics (1). Using this technique, a recent split-body study by Streker et al. demonstrated significant aesthetic improvements in face, hands and décolletage (2). However, there have been no well-controlled studies with validated aesthetic outcomes utilizing Restylane® Silk in this fashion to date. Because of the unique combination of ultra-fine product and high water-attracting capability, the investigators hypothesize that microinjections of Restylane® Silk can be used in a grid-like injection pattern for rejuvenation of the aging cheek.


Detailed Description:
This is a single center, prospective, randomized, sham-controlled, double-blind, split-face trial using micro-injections of Restylane® Silk for correction of mid to low cheek fine lines and wrinkles. Twenty (20) subjects will be enrolled. Each subject will receive Restylane® Silk to a defined area of mid to low cheek in a randomized blinded fashion with the contralateral cheek treated by sham injection. The injections will be delivered intradermally 1mm in depth via multiple 0.02 cc microinjections distributed in a grid array pattern with 0.5 cm to 1 cm between each injection point over total treatment area. The sham injections will be administered in identical fashion and will consist of sterile normal saline. Following completion of injection treatment, manual massage will be applied to the full area to promote even distribution of the product. The maximum amount of Restylane Silk to be used per treatments session/per cheek for balancing treatment is1cc (not to exceed a total of 3cc) per treated patient."

Title: Quantitative Multi-compartment Study by Thoracic CT Scanning in Progressive Pulmonary Fibrosis

Status: ACTIVE_NOT_RECRUITING


Brief Summary:
Currently, to our knowledge, there is little data on the combination of tools based on a similar concept to understand and evaluate ILDs. It is expected that this portfolio of multi-tool software implemented in radiology departments, applied to routine thoracic TDM, will provide additional qualitative and quantitative information in real time that will be of great help for diagnosis, prognosis prediction, and treatment decision-making in ILDs.


Detailed Description:
Thoracic CT scanning has revolutionized the definition of interstitial lung diseases (ILDs), some of which inexorably progress to pulmonary fibrosis (e.g., progressive pulmonary fibrosis or PPF), leading to early death or lung transplantation. Over the past decade, various treatments have shown effectiveness in slowing this fibrotic progression, but it is still not possible to define which patients might personally benefit from these treatments and when to prescribe them. Two major questions remain:

Why do some patients develop fibrosis despite seemingly appropriate treatment? What are the mechanisms driving this fibrotic progression? Hence, there is a great need to define biomarkers to answer these questions, particularly in the early phase. For more than 5 years, within a consortium including Avicenne Hospital APHP 93000 Bobigny, INSERM Unit 1272 Sorbonne Paris North University, and two partner laboratories (Mines Telecom and Ecole Polytechnique-INRIA, both belonging to the Institut Polytechnique), we have been developing the applications of artificial intelligence (AI) to lung imaging, extracting static and dynamic data from thoracic CT scans to aid in the diagnosis and follow-up of patients without additional examinations beyond standard care. Our project\&amp;#39;s objective is to identify patients at risk of progressive and irreversible fibrosis and those who could respond to antifibrotic treatments, by developing the identification of qualitative and quantitative biomarkers from the numerical modeling of routine thoracic CT scans.

Our program, which has just been funded in 2023 by the National Research Agency (ANR 2023 MLQ-CT), aims to:

Develop a portfolio of software tools, whose use should be facilitated in the hospital sector based on research prototypes already built and tested in our consortium for several years.

Apply them to a set of interstitial lung diseases (ILDs) known to be at risk of fibrotic progression.

Transfer these tools to the radiology department of Avicenne Hospital APHP. Conduct real-time experimentation between two pulmonology departments, one at Avicenne Hospital APHP and the other at Caen University Hospital, and the radiology department of Avicenne Hospital APHP, to validate the feasibility of using such biomarkers."

Title: Preoperative Tranexamic Acid (TXA) to Prevent Bleeding in Patients Undergoing Major Colorectal Surgery

Status: RECRUITING


Brief Summary:
The goal of this prospective pragmatic randomized clinical trial is to determine if preoperative administration of tranexamic acid (TXA) reduces bleeding during and after major colorectal surgery. The primary questions are:

* Does TXA reduce bleeding during and after surgery (change in hemoglobin from before surgery to lowest value after surgery within 30 days)
* Does TXA reduce bleeding complications within 30 days of surgery (blood transfusion, return to the operating room or procedural intervention for bleeding, death due to bleeding)
* Does TXA increase the risk of thromboembolic complications within 30 days of surgery (cerebrovascular accident, myocardial infarction, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism)

Researchers will compare preoperative TXA to no TXA to answer the above questions.

Participants who receive TXA will receive 1 g TXA IV at the beginning and end of surgery in the operating room.

Abstract:
<h4>Background</h4>Scientific medical research has progressed tremendously during the last 50 years, but concerns about research integrity, publishing ethics, and retraction trends have grown. Retractions are essential for revising the scientific record and maintaining credibility, yet an extensive long-term assessment of retracted medical publications is limited.<h4>Methods</h4>We performed a descriptive analysis of 50 years of retracted medical publications from the Retraction Watch Database. Data were refined to encompass solely medicine-related retractions, omitting corrections, expressions of concern, and reinstatements. We classified retraction reasons into 68 categories, emphasizing the top 10 most frequently encountered reasons. Temporal trends were evaluated employing semi-logarithmic linear regression models. The geographical distribution and journal-specific retractions were also examined.<h4>Results</h4>An analysis was conducted on 16,041 retracted medical documents from 1975 to 2024. The leading reasons for retraction included data concerns (31.47%), fraud (11.37%), peer review issues (11.21%), referencing issues (7.54%), and ethical violations (7.09%). The highest number of retractions was noted in <i>Computational and Mathematical Methods in Medicine</i> (5.91%), <i>Journal of Healthcare Engineering</i> (5.85%), and <i>Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine</i> (4.36%). Approximately 45.28% of retracted papers included at least one author from China, followed by the United States and India. The medical subfields most impacted were oncology (19.87%), cardiovascular medicine (15.62%), and pharmacology (14.49%). Temporal analysis indicated a steady rise in retractions, with data concerns and fraud doubling typically every 5.5 and 5.2 years.<h4>Conclusion</h4>The rising amount of retractions underscores heightened scrutiny and enhanced detection techniques while highlighting ongoing research integrity issues. Data integrity, fraudulent activities, and compromised peer review are significant issues. Fortifying editorial policies, augmenting transparency, and bolstering research ethics education are essential for reducing misconduct and maintaining the integrity of medical papers."

Abstract:
<h4>Background</h4>Methotrexate (MTX) is a frequently used antifolate agent in rheumatology, oncology, and dermatology. Retractions are crucial for preserving scientific integrity by fixing the literature when errors, ethical violations, or data falsification are detected. This study seeks to comprehensively examine retracted MTX publications, detecting trends, reasons, and potential ramifications.<h4>Methods</h4>A descriptive cross-sectional study was performed by searching PubMed for retracted MTX publications without temporal constraints. Bibliometric data were retrieved, encompassing publication details, journal indexing, citation metrics, and Altmetric Attention Scores (AAS). Reasons for retraction were categorized.<h4>Results</h4>Thirty-six retracted papers were identified. The predominant cause for retraction encompassed data concerns (n = 15), fraudulent activity (n = 11), and manipulation of the peer review process (n = 10). China recorded the most retractions (n = 14), followed by the USA (n = 6) and Egypt (n = 3). The median period until retraction was 712 (91-9,893) days. Most retracted articles were published in non-rheumatology journals. Citation analysis showed a median of 5 (0-105) citations. Additionally, the median AAS was 1 (0-14).<h4>Conclusion</h4>Data integrity concerns, fraudulent activities, and manipulation of peer review processes constitute major obstacles in MTX-related research. The considerable number of retractions in certain countries underscores the need to promote research ethics and measures to protect scientific integrity. Enhancing peer review, implementing more intense data transparency, and promoting post-publication evaluation are essential measures to protect scientific integrity and uphold confidence in clinical recommendations."

Abstract:
Scientific fraud, particularly within medical journals, is a critical and complex issue due to the potential consequences for public health. Medical research plays a crucial role in informing scientific innovation, guiding clinical practice, and driving advancements in treatments. False or misleading research can influence future discovery, lead to ineffective or harmful treatments, waste valuable resources, and erode public trust. A troubling increase in misconduct, including data fabrication and falsification, has been recently noted, although it's unclear whether this partially reflects the development of better methods of detection. Addressing the issue of scientific fraud in medical journals requires a concerted effort from all stakeholders involved, including researchers, journal editors, peer reviewers, funding agencies, and regulatory bodies. Implementing robust measures for detecting and preventing fraud, promoting transparency and accountability in research practices, and fostering a culture of integrity and ethical conduct are all essential steps toward safeguarding the integrity of medical research."

The retracted articles identified were required to have at least one author whose institutional affiliation was in a LATAM country. Data were collected on the authors' countries and institutional affiliations, the reason for retraction, dates of publication and retraction, indexing, journal quartile and impact factor. Reasons for retraction were categorized into three major groups, i.e., scientific misconduct, error, and not specified.<h4>Results</h4>According to Retraction Watch, 181 papers were retracted across 1987-2024 which fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Guatemala, Bolivia, Peru, Panama, Ecuador, Colombia, and Argentina were the countries that had a retraction rate above 1 per 10 thousand papers throughout the study period. The principal reason for retraction was scientific misconduct (63.0%) followed by honest error (21.5%). The main causes of retraction due to scientific misconduct were ethical and legal problems (33.1%), followed by fabrication/falsification (20.2%).<h4>Conclusion</h4>The number of retractions in some LATAM countries, mainly due to scientific misconduct, highlights the need to strengthen ethical practices in research.

Abstract:
<h4>Objective</h4>The aim was to examine reasons for retraction and rates of article retraction in the field of smoking.<h4>Material and methods</h4>We conducted an observational study and searched the largest database of articles that have been retracted.<h4>Results</h4>We found 83 papers that were retracted from 1988 to 2024. According to the type of document (documents typologies), the majority were original articles (74 papers). The 83 documents have been retracted in 65 different journals. The retracted papers' citation counts were examined by searching Web of Science (WoS) and Scopus, and we have observed that a quarter (26.5%) of the 68 articles available in the WoS database had increased their citations, despite the fact that they were retracted works. The reasons for retraction were unreliable, inconsistent, erroneous, or missing data or an incorrect conclusion; duplication of previously published articles; duplication of images into the articles or in previous articles; conflicts of interest; the ethical/plagiarism policy and authorship issues concerns; fake peer reviews; data falsification/data error; articles retracted at the authors' request; and unknown causes of retraction and journal publisher's error.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Unreliable, inconsistent, inaccurate, or missing data; an incorrect conclusion; or duplication/already published articles; duplication of images; and conflicts of interest are the main causes of retractions. Retracted articles have been increasing in number over the years, and additionally, the amount of time that passes between an article's publication and retraction is getting shorter. We verify that retracted articles indeed continue to gain citations after the retraction, some even more than before."

Abstract:
<h4>Background</h4>Gender disparities in scientific authorship are well documented, yet little is known about gender representation among authors of retracted publications.<h4>Methods</h4>We analyzed 878 retracted publications from 131 high-impact medical journals across nine clinical disciplines (anesthesiology, dermatology, general internal medicine, gynecology/obstetrics, neurology, oncology, pediatrics, psychiatry, and radiology). Gender was inferred using Gender API for all, first, and last authors. Two analytic samples were constructed based on prediction confidence thresholds (≥60% and ≥70%). We examined gender distribution across authorship positions, number of retractions per author, and disciplinary representation. Wilcoxon rank-sum and chi-squared tests were used to assess group differences. Gender proportions were compared with publication benchmarks from 2008-2017, restricting retraction data to the same period for comparability.<h4>Results</h4>Among 4,136 authors, 3,909 had full first names, and gender could be assigned to 3,865 (98.9%). In the sample with prediction confidence ≥60% (n = 3,743), 863 (23.1%) were identified as women. They accounted for 16.5% (123/747) of first and 12.7% (87/687) of last authors. They had significantly fewer retractions per author and were less likely to have >5 retractions (all authors: 3 women [8.1%] vs 34 men [91.9%], p < 0.001). Across most disciplines, their representation was below publication benchmarks. Dermatology (retractions = 80.0%, publications = 48.9-51.8%) and radiology (retractions = 40.0%, publications = 31.0-36.8%) were exceptions among first authors, while pediatrics (retractions = 50.0%, publications = 37.0%-42.6%) was an exception among last authors, though all based on small numbers.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Women are markedly underrepresented among authors of retracted publications, particularly in cases involving multiple retractions.

Abstract:
We report the prevalence and associated factors of self-reported research misconduct (RM) among 70 faculty members across two recently established public universities in Eastern Uganda. A descriptive cross-sectional survey was conducted using a structured, anonymized self-administered questionnaire adapted from the Scientific Misconduct Questionnaire-Revised (SMQ-R). Data were analyzed using STATA version 16.0. Descriptive statistics summarized participant characteristics; bivariate and multivariable logistic regression were used to identify predictors of RM. The overall prevalence of self-reported RM, defined as engagement in any one of fabrication, falsification, or plagiarism (FFP), was 31.4% (22/70). Plagiarism and falsification were each reported by 20.0% of participants, while fabrication was reported by 1.4%. Most respondents were male (72.9%), held master's-level qualifications (70.0%), and had received prior ethics training (81.4%). In multivariable analysis, prior ethics training (aOR = 0.27; 95% CI 0.07-0.98; p = 0.046) and the perception that RM is unacceptable (aOR = 0.27; 95% CI 0.07-0.98; p = 0.046) were independently associated with lower odds of self-reported RM. These findings indicate that RM is relatively common among faculty in Eastern Uganda. Although prior ethics training was associated with lower odds of self -reported RM, the persistence of misconduct suggests that existing ethics training programs need strengthening in both quality and institutional integration. Also, A multifaceted approach is needed to foster research integrity within academic institutions."

Abstract:
From its beginnings in the 1978 Declaration of Alma-Ata, universal health coverage (UHC) has been constantly evolving, notably so within the last ten years. Although the 2015 Sustainable Development Goals, which identify both UHC and social protection among its targets, represent an important juncture in this evolution, several States are unlikely to meet the 2030 target deadline. This article traces the history of UHC and social (health) protection in global health law, focusing on their development over the past ten years. It concludes by reflecting on what the future of UHC and social (health) protection should look like and what is needed to fully realize their potential to achieve equity and to meaningfully contribute to the betterment of people and planet, highlighting human rights, One Health, legal and financial considerations as key for the future."

Abstract:
After a decade of data falsification scandals and replication failures in psychology and related empirical disciplines, there are urgent calls for open science and structural reform in the publishing industry. In the meantime, however, researchers need to learn how to recognize tell-tale signs of methodological and conceptual shortcomings that make a published claim suspect. I review four key problems and propose simple ways to detect them. First, the study may be fake; if in doubt, inspect the authors' and journal's profiles and request to see the raw data to check for inconsistencies. Second, there may be too little data; low precision of effect sizes is a clear warning sign of this. Third, the data may not be analyzed correctly; excessive flexibility in data analysis can be deduced from signs of data dredging and convoluted post hoc theorizing in the text, while violations of model assumptions can be detected by examining plots of observed data and model predictions. Fourth, the conclusions may not be justified by the data; common issues are inappropriate acceptance of the null hypothesis, biased meta-analyses, over-generalization over unmodeled variance, hidden confounds, and unspecific theoretical predictions. The main takeaways are to verify that the methodology is robust and to distinguish between what the actual results are and what the authors claim these results mean when citing empirical work. Critical evaluation of published evidence is an essential skill to develop as it can prevent researchers from pursuing unproductive avenues and ensure better trustworthiness of science as a whole."

Abstract:
Scientific fake papers, containing manipulated or completely fabricated data, are a problem that has reached dramatic dimensions. Companies known as paper mills (or more bluntly as ""criminal science publishing gangs"") produce and sell such fake papers on a large scale. The main drivers of the fake paper flood are the pressure in academic systems and (monetary) incentives to publish in respected scientific journals and sometimes the personal desire for increased ""prestige."" Published fake papers cause substantial scientific, economic, and social damage. There are numerous information sources that deal with this topic from different points of view. This review aims to provide an overview of these information sources until June 2024. Much more original research with larger datasets is needed, for example on the extent and impact of the fake paper problem and especially on how to detect them, as many findings are based more on small datasets, anecdotal evidence, and assumptions. A long-term solution would be to overcome the mantra of publication metrics for evaluating scientists in academia."

Abstract:
This study aimed to systematically identify the key characteristics of retracted articles in pediatric literature and explore the patterns and reasons of pediatric retraction from 1995 to 2024. We searched PubMed and Retraction Watch databases to identify all retracted publications in the field of pediatrics. After the screening process, data were extracted into Excel. Statistical analysis was conducted using Jamovi and Excel. A correlation matrix was used for the important retraction-related factors. After screening, 590 unique retracted pediatric articles were included, with most of them, 572 (96.9%), having retraction notices available; 516 (87.5%) published as open access; 433 (73.4%) from Asia-mostly China; 348 (59%) retracted by the publisher; 301 (51.0%) published by Hindawi; 275 (46.6%) observational studies; and 221 (37.5%) retracted due to misconduct. Articles with four authors showed the highest retraction rate, and the retraction rate generally decreased as the number of authors increased. Most retractions occurred in 2023. The most common pediatric age group included in the retracted papers was children. The median H-index of authors of retracted papers was 8 for first authors and 10 for senior authors. The median time from submission to acceptance of retracted papers was 50 days and that from publication to retraction was 15 months. Additionally, time to retraction was positively correlated with the journal's impact factor (r = 0.106, p = 0.015) and the citation count (r = 0.213, p < 0.001) but showed no significant correlation with time to acceptance (r = - 0.019, p = 0.675).<h4>Conclusion</h4>The increasing number of retracted pediatric papers reflects a growing concern with a complex pattern and various determinants. Researchers and publishers should adopt strong regulations and guidelines to improve the integrity of scientific research, especially pediatric research.<h4>What is known</h4>• Retractions in biomedical research have been increasing over the past decades, often due to research misconduct, plagiarism, or data fabrication. • Previous studies have analyzed retraction patterns across several medical specialties, but pediatric research remains underexplored despite its ethical and clinical sensitivity.<h4>What is new</h4>• This is the most comprehensive analysis of retracted publications in pediatric literature, covering 590 articles from 1995 to 2024 and revealing distinct geographic, temporal, and publisher- and author-related patterns."

Abstract:
Generative artificial intelligence (AI) has the capability to generate new content-including text, code, imagery, video, and speech-based on human prompts and is entering dental and oral research. By retrieving, analyzing, summarizing, and contextualizing vast datasets, generative AI offers substantial potential to enhance scientific workflows. It can improve documentation, communication, and reproducibility while saving time and accelerating discovery. However, its integration into research brings significant ethical, societal, and scientific challenges. Concerns include embedded data biases, automation bias, overreliance, and error propagation, all requiring critical human oversight. Furthermore, generative AI raises complex issues around plagiarism, fraud, attribution, and reproducibility, compounded by the potential for AI ""hallucinations"" or fabricated content. Addressing these concerns demands transparency, robust verification processes, ethical compliance, and clear documentation distinguishing synthetic from real-world data. Several scientific and regulatory bodies have published guidelines to support responsible AI use. Recommendations relevant to scientists in dental, oral, and craniofacial research include transparent disclosure of AI tools and methods, thorough verification of AI outputs, ethical oversight, and active monitoring. Scientists are urged to work collaboratively with stakeholders to enforce these principles and engage the public in the evolving discourse. The risk of misuse, particularly through fraudulent AI-generated publications, is growing. Paper mills exploiting generative AI can produce fabricated or manipulated articles, which may mislead the scientific community and distort evidence bases. Coordinated action, involving journals, institutions, and ethics bodies, is essential to combat these threats. As generative AI continues to evolve, adaptive and harmonized guidelines will be necessary to safeguard scientific integrity. Researchers, reviewers, and editors must play a proactive role in ensuring that AI serves to advance-not undermine-the quality and trustworthiness of dental and oral science."

Abstract:
<p>The integrity of biomedical research is increasingly challenged by a concerning rise in article retractions, which serve as critical indicators of both procedural errors and deliberate misconduct. This systematic review investigates 13,834 retracted publications in biomedical journals between 2010 and 2025, analyzing temporal trends, misconduct categories, and editorial responses. The review protocol was prospectively registered with the Open Science Framework (OSF) to ensure methodological transparency. Data were sourced exclusively from the Retraction Watch database, which provides the most comprehensive and continuously updated repository of retractions across biomedical journals. Eligible articles included original research publications with clearly stated retraction reasons, excluding editorials, corrections, and non‑biomedical content.Our findings reveal a sustained increase in retractions, peaking at 2,300 in 2023, largely driven by fabrication, plagiarism, and falsification, though a notable proportion stemmed from honest errors. We also identify inconsistencies in retraction notices and gaps in editorial transparency, particularly linked to paper mills and fake peer review. These results underscore the urgent need for stronger oversight mechanisms, enhanced peer‑review protocols, and improved metadata reporting. By quantifying misconduct patterns and highlighting systemic vulnerabilities, this review contributes to global efforts to reinforce research accountability and preserve the credibility of the scientific record.</p>"

Abstract:
On June 1, 2024, the World Health Assembly reached consensus on a package of amendments to the 2005 International Health Regulations (IHR). These amendments follow nearly two decades of implementation and an intensive multilateral process prompted by the global struggle against COVID-19. This article critically examines whether the amended IHR reflect lessons learned from the pandemic, potentially ushering in a new era for global health law in pandemic preparedness and response, or if they deflect attention from the need for deeper structural reforms. While the IHR remain the only near-universal legal framework for preventing and addressing the international spread of disease, these amendments emphasize equity and solidarity, and potentially shift the IHR from a technical instrument to one focusing on inherently political issues. This analysis examines key IHR amendments and their implications for the future of global health law, particularly in the context of equity, financing, and implementation."

Abstract:
Scientific progress relies on science's capacity for self-correction. If erroneous articles remain unchallenged in the publication record, they can mislead future research and undermine evidence-based decision-making. All articles included in a systematic review of animal studies on early brain injury after subarachnoid hemorrhage were analyzed for image-related issues. We included 608 articles, of which 243 articles were identified as problematic (40.0%). Of the 243 problematic articles, 55 (22.6%) have been corrected, 7 (2.9%) have received an expression of concern, 5 (2.1%) were marked with the Taylor & Francis under investigation pop-up, and 19 (7.8%) were retracted. In 9 of the 55 corrected articles (16.4%), new problems were found after correction or not all issues were resolved in the correction. Most (n = 213, 87.7%) problematic articles had a corresponding author affiliated to an institute from China. Our results show that the self-correcting mechanisms in science have stalled in this field of research. Our findings provide insight in the prevalence of image-related issues and can help publishers to take appropriate action. We can only uphold science's capacity for self-correction when problematic articles are actively identified by peers, and when publishers take swift and adequate action to repair the scientific record."

Abstract:
The application of new technologies, such as artificial intelligence (AI), to science affects the way and methodology in which research is conducted. While the responsible use of AI brings many innovations and benefits to science and humanity, its unethical use poses a serious threat to scientific integrity and literature. Even in the absence of malicious use, the Chatbot output itself, as a software application based on AI, carries the risk of containing biases, distortions, irrelevancies, misrepresentations and plagiarism. Therefore, the use of complex AI algorithms raises concerns about bias, transparency and accountability, requiring the development of new ethical rules to protect scientific integrity. Unfortunately, the development and writing of ethical codes cannot keep up with the pace of development and implementation of technology. The main purpose of this narrative review is to inform readers, authors, reviewers and editors about new approaches to publication ethics in the era of AI. It specifically focuses on tips on how to disclose the use of AI in your manuscript, how to avoid publishing entirely AI-generated text, and current standards for retraction."

Abstract:
Retraction Watch indicates that half of the worst 10 cases of research misconduct were by Japanese researchers. This is exemplified in an article entitled 'Tide of Lies' published in the Journal ""Science"". This article is a no holds barred view of some of the science in Japan and is an essential step on the road to prevention. However, as 3 Japanese anesthesiologists are listed in the worst 10, many Japanese academic societies point the finger at the Japanese Society of Anesthesiologists (JSA). The society cannot ignore this. Prevention of research misconduct/fraud has therefore been considered. Whilst there are no measures that can completely prevent research misconduct, there are steps that can reduce its likelihood. At the researcher level, mandatory ethics training. At the department and laboratory level, central data management, regular research progress/debriefing meetings. At the academic society level, Research Misconduct Monitoring Committees should be set up to facilitate anonymous reporting. Regaining research reputation and passion in Japan is critical to moving our specialty forward. This must be done with renewed vigor for the prevention of research misconduct."

Abstract:
Scientific papers are the driving force for research, information dissemination, and policymaking that directly impacts society. Thus, ethical practices are the elixir of publications. Adherence to ethical practices promotes integrity in research and publication. Transgression of ethics is thus considered a poison to science. Although there is no definition of ethics, it includes a systematic approach that not only recommends but also defends and protects concepts of the conduct of right and wrong. Therefore, ethical principles should be strictly adhered to and upheld at any cost for the progression of science. This article addresses various actions that are considered ethical misconduct and guidelines to fix them. Recommendations of various organizations related to the ethics in publications are also discussed."

Abstract:
Academic plagiarism undermines the integrity of scientific research. While text-based plagiarism detection tools are widely used, the rise of artificial intelligence (AI) has introduced new challenges, particularly in text and image generation and manipulation. We briefly discuss the evolving landscape of plagiarism and the innovations that have come about with the proliferation of AI, focusing on the implications for text and image manipulation in academic writing and research. We discuss some of the current tools and practices used to detect AI-generated and manipulated text and images, including plagiarism detection software, computer vision algorithms, and manual reverse image searches. AI can enhance manuscript readability but also facilitates plagiarism and bias reinforcement due to the material it is trained on. Text-based detection tools are adapting to AI-generated content, yet image-based detection lags behind. Though tools to detect AI manipulation show promise, they are not perfect, particularly for manipulated images. Simple reverse image searches are a promising tool and can sometimes identify plagiarized figures that have undergone limited manipulation, but human oversight is often necessary. We believe that integrating image fabrication, manipulation and plagiarism detection into standard fraud detection packages is essential to uphold academic integrity in the new world of AI. Enhanced vigilance and technology are critical, particularly in fields like medical imaging, where image authenticity directly impacts research and thus clinical outcomes. KEY POINTS: We discuss the problems related to the rise of AI with regard to image manipulation in academic work, and how radiology is particularly at risk. We shed light on the rarely and little discussed topic of AI image manipulation and outright fraud. We hope to incite further discussion and adoption of image fraud prevention software. We discuss the use of some tools which are gradually becoming adopted and how some journals have begun to screen for image manipulation and fraud. We suggest an easy technique of using reverse image search that can sometimes be extremely useful despite its simplicity and can be easily adapted into researchers' practice."

Abstract:
Retractions serve a crucial role in maintaining the integrity and accuracy of scientific literature. There has been growing interest in understanding the patterns behind retractions. This bibliometric study analyzed retracted articles published between 2003 and 2022, indexed by the Science Citation Index Expanded of the Web of Science Core Collection database. A total of 8466 retracted articles were identified, revealing an overall increase up to 2019, followed by a decline. A total of 109 countries contributed to the retracted articles, with China and the United States having the highest absolute numbers. In addition, the articles were published in 2347 different journals, with Tumor Biology recording the largest number of retracted articles. The top 10 most cited retracted articles indicated that data and image integrity issues were the main reasons for retraction. The primary reasons for retractions, identified by linking the retracted articles to the Retraction Watch Database, were data and results issues followed by plagiarism and duplication. In conclusion, the present bibliometric study offered an overview of the status of retracted articles indexed by the Web of Science Core Collection over the past two decades. These findings provide insight into areas where scientific integrity may be compromised and serve as a guide to foster a responsible research environment."

Abstract:
A systematic review with meta-analysis (SRMA) represents the pinnacle of evidence, but its validity depends on methodological rigor. This narrative review synthesizes recommendations from major reporting frameworks- Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta‑Analyses 2020 (PRISMA‑2020), Meta‑Analysis of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (MOOSE) and Preferred Reporting Items for Overviews of Reviews (PRIOR)-into a concise checklist for peer reviewers. The checklist addresses common sources of bias that often escape editorial assessment. Initially, it outlines how reviewers should assess the rationale for an SRMA by identifying existing syntheses on the same topic and determining whether the new work provides substantive novelty or a significant update. Best practices are summarized for protocol registration, comprehensive search strategies, study selection and data extraction, risk-of-bias evaluation, and context-appropriate statistical modeling, with a specific focus on heterogeneity, small-study effects, and data transparency. Case examples highlight frequent pitfalls, such as unjustified pooling of heterogeneous designs and selective outcome reporting. Guidance is also provided for formulating balanced, actionable review comments that enhance methodological integrity without extending editorial timelines. This checklist equips editors and reviewers with a structured tool for systematic appraisal across clinical disciplines, ultimately improving the reliability, reproducibility, and clinical utility of future SRMAs."

Abstract:
We analyzed dermatology retraction trends (2006-2024) by examining causes, geographic distribution, journal metrics, and citation patterns. Our purpose was to identify systemic issues and propose solutions to enhance research integrity and mitigate postretraction citation risks in the field. A bibliometric analysis was conducted on 280 retracted dermatology contributions from the Retraction Database (2006-2024), supplemented by Scopus for publication and citation data. The annual number of retractions showed a highly significant increase over the period, peaking at 74 in 2023. Academic misconduct (data fabrication/tampering and plagiarism) was the leading cause, accounting for 45% of all retractions. United States had the highest absolute count (n = 80), whereas China exhibited the highest normalized retraction rate (357 per 10,000 publications), contrasting sharply with the US rate (19.7 per 10,000). Postretraction citation analysis (n = 80 contributions) revealed a high proportion of inappropriate citations (30%). The sharply increasing retraction trend, driven largely by misconduct and geographic disparities, requires urgent, multilevel interventions, including stricter oversight, ethical training, and improved peer review. Addressing postretraction citations is critical to curbing misinformation."

Abstract:
High-quality cancer research is crucial to both save lives and improve quality of life. Spurious findings, however, impedes these laudable goals by misleading research efforts and creating research waste that is inherently difficult to counteract. Irreproducible research is intrinsically wasteful, and unsustainable over the long term. In this perspective piece, we elucidate the extent of the current replication crisis and the underlying causes, identifying practices that lend themselves to unsustainable spurious findings, and the factors that underpin these practices. Finally we outline some remedies to the problem of irreproducible research, and how we might move towards more sustainable and trustworthy research in biomedical science."

Abstract:
<h4>Introduction</h4>breaches of research integrity have risen during these years. Tunisia´s stance regarding scientific integrity remains unknown. The aim of our study was to identify the reasons for the retraction of Tunisia-affiliated publications in the biomedical field, to describe the characteristics of these retractions, and to assess the position of Tunisian legislation regarding breaches of research integrity.<h4>Methods</h4>I compiled up to November 3<sup>rd</sup>, 2023, and retracted biomedical papers using the PubMed and Retraction Watch databases. For each eligible retracted article, a descriptive study of the collected variables was carried out. These included the reasons for retraction, characteristics related to the article, authors, and journal.<h4>Results</h4>the search identified 22 eligible publications. Reasons for retraction were categorized into six groups. Plagiarism accounted for 45.5% of cases. The first retraction dated back to 2005, with an average number of retracted publications being 1.22 and a median retraction time of 347 days. Among the retracted publications, 77.3% included a retraction notice. A post-retraction citation was found in 81.3% of cases. None of the retracted articles were written by a single author. An international collaboration was found in 27.3% of cases. Ninety-five point five percent of journals offered open access with 81.8% using a gold open access model. In terms of bibliometrics, eleven articles were published in highly reputed journals.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Tunisia is not spared from breaches of scientific integrity. The controversies relating to the categories of breaches call for standardization. The legislative framework for this phenomenon also remains to be developed in Tunisia."

Abstract:
In this Viewpoint we discuss Chemistry manuscripts retracted during the 2001-2021 period (a total of 1292 journal articles retrieved from the Retraction Watch database). We showed that 58.5% of Chemistry manuscripts were retracted due to misconduct; of them, 40.5% of retractions were due to self-plagiarism and 36% due to fraud. Errors and concerns unrelated to misconduct constituted 26% of all retractions. Retracted manuscripts had a median retraction time of 1.7 years and peer-review time of 71 days (but only 43 days for fraudulent manuscripts)."

Abstract:
Researcher fraud is often easy and enticing in academic research, with little risk of detection. Cases of extensive fraud continue to occur. The amount of fraud that goes undetected is unknown and may be substantial. Three strategies for addressing researcher fraud are (a) retrospective investigations after allegations of fraud have been made, (b) sting operations that provide conclusive evidence of fraud as it occurs, and (c) data management practices that prevent the occurrence of fraud. Institutional and regulatory efforts to address researcher fraud have focused almost exclusively on the retrospective strategy. The retrospective approach is subject to controversy due to the limitations of <i>post-hoc</i> evidence in science, the difficulty in establishing who actually committed the fraud in some cases, the application of a legal standard of evidence that is much lower than the usual standards of evidence in science, and the lack of legal expertise by scientists investigating fraud. The retrospective strategy may be reliably effective primarily in cases of extensive, careless fraud. Sting operations can overcome these limitations and controversies, but are not feasible in many situations. Data management practices that are effective at preventing researcher fraud and unintentional errors are well-established in clinical trials regulated by government agencies, but appear to be largely unknown or unimplemented in most academic research. Established data management practices include: archiving secure copies of the raw data, audit trails, restricted access to the data and data collection processes, software validation, quality control checks, blinding, preregistration of data processing and analysis programs, and research audits that directly address fraud. Current discussions about data management in academic research focus on sharing data with little attention to practices that prevent intentional and unintentional errors. A designation or badge such as <i>error-controlled data management</i> could be established to indicate research that was conducted with data management practices that effectively address intentional and unintentional errors."

Abstract:
The use of Generative AI (GenAI) in scientific writing has grown rapidly, offering tools for manuscript drafting, literature summarization, and data analysis. However, these benefits are accompanied by risks, including undisclosed AI authorship, manipulated content, and the emergence of papermills. This perspective examines two key strategies for maintaining research integrity in the GenAI era: (1) detecting unethical or inappropriate use of GenAI in scientific manuscripts and (2) using AI tools to identify mistakes in scientific literature, such as statistical errors, image manipulation, and incorrect citations. We reviewed the capabilities and limitations of existing AI detectors designed to differentiate human-written (HWT) from machine-generated text (MGT), highlighting performance gaps, genre sensitivity, and vulnerability to adversarial attacks. We also investigate emerging AI-powered systems aimed at identifying errors in published research, including tools for statistical verification, citation validation, and image manipulation detection. Additionally, we discuss recent publishing industry initiatives to AI-driven papermills. Our investigation shows that these developments are not yet sufficiently accurate or reliable yet for use in academic assessment, they mark an early but promising steps toward scalable, AI-assisted quality control in scholarly publishing."

Abstract:
<h4>Objective</h4>To investigate why retractions in academic literature have risen substantially, leading to rising concerns about research reliability and integrity. While retraction trends have been explored across disciplines, urology-specific factors remain underexamined. This study investigates 292 retracted urological publications from 2014 to 2024, focusing on open-access journals to analyze how publishing models influence retraction trends.<h4>Methods</h4>A retrospective analysis of retracted urological publications was conducted using the PubMed database. The study employed 84 MeSH search terms to identify articles and categorize them by research type, journal impact factor, citation count, geographical distribution, and retraction reasons. Statistical analyses were performed to assess associations between retraction characteristics.<h4>Results</h4>The most common reason for retraction (90.4%) was discrepancies in data availability or research description, with systematic publication manipulation accounting for 5.1%. The majority of retractions (84.5%) originated from China. Journals with higher impact factors exhibited longer recall times for retractions but no significant difference in citation count at recall.<h4>Conclusion</h4>This study highlights the increasing frequency of retractions in urology and identifies key factors influencing these trends. Geographic disparities, open-access models, and journal impact factors play significant roles. Addressing research integrity requires improved editorial oversight, standardized reporting guidelines, and enhanced detection of publication misconduct."

Abstract:
Research misconduct practices like fabrication, falsification and plagiarism (FFP) are serious deviations from good research conduct, which have attracted attention in the literature due to the damage they can bring to science and society. However, less is known about the grey zone of researchers' behaviours that deviate from responsible research conduct but do not fall under serious research misconduct practices. These are known as questionable research practices (QRPs), and they are believed to pose a no less serious threat to research integrity and science. Despite increasing research on the topic, the extent of the problem in different research fields and contexts is unknown. Using a sample of researchers working in Portuguese universities in six main fields of research (n = 1573), we report on QRPs that researchers admit to and how serious they perceive them to be, and on predictors of engagement in QRPs. We find that QRPs are widespread across all fields of research and seniority levels. Yet, younger, more prolific researchers, and those dismissing the seriousness of QRPs admitted to more QRPs. This suggests that some groups are at higher risk of misconduct and that there is a need for studying the motivations behind more susceptible groups to engage in QRPs."

Abstract:
Multiple instruments have been used to assess academic misconduct, yet robust psychometric evidence has been reported only for a few. This study aims to determine the validity and dimensionality of a novel Academic Misconduct Questionnaire (AMQ) and to explore differences between students who engage in distinct misbehaviours. A diverse sample of health and non-health students replied to the AMQ. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses were conducted using two subsamples. Predictive models were computed for the AMQ and its dimensions. The questionnaire showed good validity and reliability, revealing eight dimensions related to Cheating during (two forms) and prior Exams, Plagiarism, Fraud in Academic Work, Impersonation (assessment), Signature Forgery in attendance sheets and Not Reporting peer misconduct. The predictors of student engagement in each form of misconduct differed, except for perceiving greater peer fraud, which increased the propensity for all misbehaviours. Perceiving higher sanctions reduced the propensity to engage in most forms, while gender played a role in half of them. First-year students were more likely to Not Reporting peer misconduct and less likely to disclose Fraud in Academic Work and Signature Forgery than those in more advanced years. Health students scored higher in most misbehaviours, especially compared to Economics/Law, Social Sciences and Arts/Humanities, while the latter two disclosed higher Signature Forgery. This study proposes a valid instrument to assess academic misconduct in university students. The predictive models helped to better understand differences between students who engaged in distinct misbehaviours, enabling more targeted interventions."

Abstract:
<h4>Background</h4>Research on research integrity (RI) has grown exponentially over the past several decades. Although the earliest publications emerged in the 1980 s, more than half of the existing literature has been produced within the last five years. Given that the most recent comprehensive literature review is now eight years old, the present study aims to extend and update previous findings.<h4>Method</h4>We conducted a systematic search of the Web of Science and Constellate databases for articles published between 2015 and 2023. To structure our overview and guide our inquiry, we addressed the following seven broad questions about the field:-What topics does the empirical literature on RI explore? What are the primary objectives of the empirical literature on RI? What methodologies are prevalent in the empirical literature on RI? What populations or organizations are studied in the empirical literature on RI? Where are the empirical studies on RI conducted? Where is the empirical literature on RI published? To what degree is the general literature on RI grounded in empirical research? Additionally, we used the previous scoping review as a benchmark to identify emerging trends and shifts.<h4>Results</h4>Our search yielded a total of 3,282 studies, of which 660 articles met our inclusion criteria. All research questions were comprehensively addressed. Notably, we observed a significant shift in methodologies: the reliance on interviews and surveys decreased from 51 to 30%, whereas the application of meta-scientific methods increased from 17 to 31%. In terms of theoretical orientation, the previously dominant ""Bad Apple"" hypothesis declined from 54 to 30%, while the ""Wicked System"" hypothesis increased from 46 to 52%. Furthermore, there has been a pronounced trend toward testing solutions, rising from 31 to 56% at the expense of merely describing the problem, which fell from 69 to 44%.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Three gaps highlighted eight years ago by the previous scoping review remain unresolved. Research on decision makers (e.g., scientists in positions of power, policymakers, accounting for 3%), the private research sector and patents (4.7%), and the peer review system (0.3%) continues to be underexplored. Even more concerning, if current trends persist, these gaps are likely to become increasingly problematic."

Abstract:
<h4>Background</h4>Retractions undermine the scientific record's reliability and can lead to the continued propagation of flawed research. This study aimed to (1) create a dataset aggregating retraction information with bibliographic metadata, (2) train and evaluate various machine learning approaches to predict article retractions, and (3) assess each feature's contribution to feature-based classifier performance using ablation studies.<h4>Methods</h4>An open-access dataset was developed by combining information from the Retraction Watch database and the OpenAlex API. Using a case-controlled design, retracted research articles were paired with non-retracted articles published in the same period. Traditional feature-based classifiers and models leveraging contextual language representations were then trained and evaluated. Model performance was assessed using accuracy, precision, recall, and the F1-score.<h4>Results</h4>The Llama 3.2 base model achieved the highest overall accuracy. The Random Forest classifier achieved a precision of 0.687 for identifying non-retracted articles, while the Llama 3.2 base model reached a precision of 0.683 for identifying retracted articles. Traditional feature-based classifiers generally outperformed most contextual language models, except for the Llama 3.2 base model, which showed competitive performance across several metrics.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Although no single model excelled across all metrics, our findings indicate that machine learning techniques can effectively support the identification of retracted research. These results provide a foundation for developing automated tools to assist publishers and reviewers in detecting potentially problematic publications. Further research should focus on refining these models and investigating additional features to improve predictive performance.<h4>Trial registration</h4>Not applicable."

Abstract:
<h4>Introduction</h4>Academic misconduct remains a pervasive issue in higher education institutions, undermining both academic integrity and the quality of the educational environment. Existing research primarily focuses on describing the forms and frequency of violations.<h4>Objective</h4>This study evaluated the effectiveness of an educational intervention designed to modify students' attitudes and behaviors regarding academic integrity.<h4>Methods</h4>The study implemented a controlled experimental design with pre-test and post-test measurements. The participants were 400 undergraduate students from a Chinese university (202 males and 198 females, mean age = 21 years), who were assigned to either an experimental or control group. The six-month intervention was an educational program comprising lectures, role-playing exercises, discussions, and interactive workshops. The scale of academic dishonesty developed by Rawwas and Isakson was used to measure aspects such as acceptance of cheating, unfair advantages, data fabrication, and disregard for dishonest practices.<h4>Results</h4>The analysis revealed statistically significant improvements across all categories among students in the experimental group after completing the program. No significant changes were observed in the control group.<h4>Conclusion</h4>The findings confirm the efficacy of structured educational programs in reducing the propensity for academic misconduct. This study provides empirical evidence useful for universities seeking to implement ethical standards and foster a culture of academic integrity."

Abstract:
Directional droplet motion on solid surfaces, governed by Gibbs' theory of minimizing surface free energy, traditionally relies on static surface gradients. However, such approaches face intrinsic constraints, including fixed transport directions and interdependence between transport distance and speed. Here, we introduce shape-evolving microfiber rails (SEMRs) that enable spontaneous droplet transport on initially non-gradient surfaces. Inspired by a domino-like mechanism, the SEMRs dynamically generate cascading gradients through shape deformations in response to droplet-surface interactions, diverging from conventional static-gradient designs. This adaptive strategy allows for steerable droplet motion, independent control over transport distance and velocity, and design flexibility for on-demand performance optimization. The SEMR's versatility heralds advanced applications across analytical chemistry, cargo transport, electronics, and diagnostics, paving the way for advanced intelligent fluidic systems."

Abstract:
<h4>Background</h4>Understanding how unprofessionalism is interpreted and enacted in low- and middle-income countries is essential for developing health professionals that are contextually and socially grounded. The scoping review explores and maps existing scientific evidence on unprofessional behaviour in health professions education from a Global South perspective. The review was informed by the research question: How is unprofessional behaviour defined, conceptualised, and framed theoretically in health professions education within the Global South?<h4>Methods</h4>Using a scoping review, we retrieved 382 articles, of which 14 articles were published between 2004 and 2024. The articles were retrieved across PubMed/MEDLINE, Scopus, Web of Science, EBSCOhost (Academic Search Complete, Health Source, and PsycINFO) databases, and supplemented by Google Scholar.<h4>Results</h4>The studies emerged from 10 countries, with the majority conducted in the United Arab Emirates (21.4%), followed by Saudi Arabia and Thailand with 14.3% each, and other countries each contributing 7.1% of the total studies. The highest number of studies was published in 2017, 2020, and 2023 (14.3% each). Most study designs were cross-sectional (71.5%), while qualitative studies accounted for 21.4%, and mixed methods were 7.1%. The study populations predominantly consisted of medical students (64.4%), followed by residents (14.3%), and smaller groups including multi-disciplinary students (Medicine, Pharmacy, Nursing), clinicians and medical students, and clinical faculty members and medical students with 7.1% each. The studies were conducted across academic and clinical settings (50.0%), with others focusing solely on clinical environments (28.6%), preclinical settings (14.3%), and a clinical and surgical training environment (7.1%). Five key themes emerged: Academic Dishonesty and Integrity Violations, Bullying and Harassment, Clinical and Ethical Misconduct, Disrespect and Power Abuse, and Neglect of Professional Responsibilities.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The study findings draw attention to the need for theoretical engagement and institutional reforms that reflect the realities of educational and clinical training environments in low- and middle-income countries."

Abstract:
<h4>Background</h4>The increasing prevalence of retracted publications in stem cell research presents significant challenges to scientific integrity. Although retraction notices are issued, retracted studies continue to be cited, facilitating the dissemination of unreliable findings. This study aimed to systematically explore the characteristics of retracted stem cell publications and evaluate the impact of retractions on subsequent citations.<h4>Methods</h4>This study was conducted following the PRISMA guidelines. A comprehensive search of Web of Science, Retraction Watch Database, and PubMed was conducted from their inception through July 25, 2024, to identify retracted stem cell publications. Characteristics including publication details, retraction reasons, and citation counts were extracted. To assess the impact of retraction on subsequent citations, we compared citation patterns between a random sample of retracted papers and matched non-retracted controls from identical journals and issues. Further analysis was conducted to determine whether papers citing retracted articles had an elevated risk of subsequent retraction. Descriptive statistics, chi-squared tests, t-tests, and Mann-Kendall tests were used for data analysis.<h4>Results</h4>The systematic search identified 1421 records, with 517 publications meeting inclusion criteria. Temporal analysis revealed two significant trends: an increasing retraction rate that peaked at 0.84% in 2023 and a declining time-to-retraction (median: 30 months, interquartile range: 13-60; Mann-Kendall, tau = - 0.29; P < 0.001). Hospital-affiliated researchers from China contributed to 244 (47.2%) of retractions. Data and image flaws were identified in 360 (69.6%) of retractions. Among 472 Web of Science-indexed retracted publications, 366 (77.5%) accumulated 4884 post-retraction citations, with 114 (24.2%) receiving more citations post-retraction than pre-retraction. Analysis of a random subset of retracted articles (n = 53) demonstrated that only 14 (4.2%) out of 334 post-retraction citations referenced the retraction notice. Compared with 639 non-retracted control publications, retracted articles showed significantly lower post-retraction citation rates (mean rank: 291.32 vs. 351.08; P = 0.01). Moreover, papers citing retracted articles exhibited an 11-fold higher risk of subsequent retraction (odds ratio (OR): 11.09; 95% confidence interval (CI): 7.06-17.43).<h4>Conclusions</h4>This analysis reveals substantial research integrity challenges within stem cell research. These findings suggest the necessity for enhanced surveillance mechanisms and standardized protocols to identify and curtail the dissemination of flawed research."

Abstract:
<h4>Background</h4>Academic misconduct remains a pervasive challenge in medical education, threatening the integrity of research and healthcare outcomes. Traditional self-reporting methods for identifying misconduct are often limited by social desirability bias, leading to significant underreporting. This study explores the use of an indirect feedback approach to provide a more accurate assessment of academic misconduct among medical students.<h4>Methods</h4>A cross-sectional study was conducted involving 1,622 postgraduate medical students from five medical institutions in Sichuan and Chongqing. Participants completed a structured questionnaire designed to collect demographic information, indirect feedback on observed misconduct, and perceptions of academic pressures. Observed misconduct included data fabrication, plagiarism, and inappropriate authorship. Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS, employing chi-square tests to evaluate associations between demographic variables and reported observations.<h4>Results</h4>Only 2.71% of participants admitted personal involvement in misconduct, whereas 27.11% reported observing such behaviors within their networks. The most frequently observed misconduct occurred during data collection (31.73%) and data processing (29.51%), stages often marked by minimal oversight. Male students, those in higher academic years, and individuals with more publications were significantly more likely to report observed misconduct (p < 0.001). Notably, respondents with no publications reported lower levels of observed misconduct (26.85%) compared to those with 3-5 publications (45.93%). Additionally, respondents identified misconduct among undergraduate peers, research group members, and collaborators, with undergraduate peers accounting for the highest proportion (45.35%).<h4>Conclusion</h4>Indirect feedback revealed a 27.11% prevalence of observed misconduct, compared to only 2.71% self-reported, suggesting underreporting in traditional approaches. This method provides valuable insights into misconduct patterns and at-risk groups, enabling the development of targeted interventions. Despite its potential, limitations such as reliance on self-reported observations warrant further refinement. Future research should integrate indirect feedback with complementary tools to enhance monitoring systems and foster a culture of transparency and accountability in medical education. By addressing academic misconduct effectively, institutions can uphold research integrity and public trust in scientific outcomes."

Abstract:
The federal government has a long history of trying to find the right balance in supporting scientific and medical research while protecting the public and other researchers from potential harms. To date, this balance has been generally calibrated differently across contexts - including in clinical care, human subjects research, and research integrity. New challenges continue to face this disparate model of regulation, including novel Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) tools. Because of potential increases in unintentional fabrication, falsification, and plagiarism using GenAI - and challenges establishing both these errors and intentionality in retrospect - this article argues that we should instead move toward a system that sets accepted community standards for the use of GenAI in research as prospective requirements."

Abstract:
Introduction Recent studies revealed high rates of questionable research practices and scientific misconduct among academic researchers. These practices may result in retraction of scientific publications. This scoping review aimed to analyse the characteristics of retracted publications with a focus on dental research.Methods To identify retracted articles in the field of dentistry, electronic searches were performed on PubMed Central, Web of Science, and the Retraction Watch website. Subsequently, data extraction was performed on identified relevant publications. Descriptive statistics were used to provide an overview of the characteristics of retracted scientific publications in dental research.Results The final dataset consisted of 333 retracted articles. The majority of these publications were written by authors from Asia (60.6%), particularly India (22.2%) and China (20.1%). More than half of the publications were retracted because of various forms of misconduct (57.4%), such as plagiarism, data duplication and data fabrication. Oral pathology was the subdiscipline in dentistry with the highest number of retracted publications (26.4%) and animal studies were the most prevalent study design among retracted publications (14.1%).Conclusions A large number of publications in dental research have been retracted during the past two decades, primarily to instances of scientific misconduct. Researchers, journal editors and academic institutions should prioritise the prevention and detection of misconduct to uphold the credibility and reliability of published dental literature."

Abstract:
Taylor & Francis journal <i>Bioengineered</i> has been targeted by paper mills. Our goal is to identify problematic articles published in <i>Bioengineered</i> during the period 2010 to 2024. Dimensions was used to search for articles that contained the terms 'mouse' OR 'mice' OR 'rat' OR 'rats' in title or abstract, published in <i>Bioengineered</i> between January 1st 2010 to December 31st 2024. All articles were assessed by eye and by using software to detect inappropriate image duplication and manipulation. An article was classified as problematic if it contained inappropriate image duplication or manipulation or had been previously retracted. Problematic articles were reported on PubPeer by the authors if they had not been reported previously. All included articles were assessed for post-publication editorial decisions. We have excluded all articles published in 2024 from further analysis, as these were all retraction notices. We assessed the remaining 878 articles, of which 226 (25.7%) were identified as problematic, of which 35 had been previously retracted. One retracted article was later de-retracted. One article received a correction. None of the included articles received an expression of concern or the Taylor & Francis 'under investigation' pop-up. Taylor & Francis' lack of visible editorial action has left the scientific community vulnerable to reading and citing hundreds of problematic articles published in <i>Bioengineered</i>. To uphold scientific integrity, Taylor & Francis should use the findings of this study as a starting point to systematically identify all compromised articles in <i>Bioengineered</i> and take appropriate editorial action."

Abstract:
Trustworthy literature is an essential part of knowledge, evidence-based information, and science. However, publications can contain mistakes or have results from unreliable research, which may compromise their integrity. In this review, we discuss publication integrity, with a focus on our field of biomedicine, and how it could be improved. In our experience, compromised publication integrity is frequently poorly handled, and we, and others, have reported that responses to publication integrity concerns can be inefficient, inconsistent, slow, opaque, and incomplete. Checklists and tools are now available to assist in the assessment of publication integrity, but systemic changes are needed. However, this requires many of the key parties involved (journals, publishers, institutions, academic societies, and regulators) to acknowledge and engage with the problem. There is little evidence of a willingness to do this. We conclude that it has been recognised for many years that the system for dealing with publication integrity is broken, but currently, there appears little interest in trying to improve it."

Abstract:
The criminal trafficking of falsified medical products is a worldwide, yet still largely overlooked, public health problem. A falsified medicine fraudulently misrepresents its identity, composition and/or source, often being ineffective or toxic for patients. Although techniques have been developed to detect falsified medicines, it remains a challenge to trace where- and by whom- the products are manufactured. We aim to discuss plausible biological and physico-chemical analytical techniques that could reveal information about the origin of medical falsifications. We first provide a brief overview on the prevalence, criminal activities, health impacts and (bio)chemical features of falsified medical products. We then explore diverse laboratory approaches, that are used in food fraud, illicit drug and wildlife trafficking investigations, and discuss how they could be combined and redirected towards tracing falsified medicine origin and hence empowering enforcement to counter this pernicious but neglected global health problem."

Abstract:
<h4>Background</h4>This systematic review aimed to investigate the relationship between retraction status and the methodology quality in the retracted non-Cochrane systematic review.<h4>Method</h4>PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus databases were searched with keywords including systematic review, meta-analysis, and retraction or retracted as a type of publication until September 2023. There were no time or language restrictions. Non-Cochrane medical systematic review studies that were retracted were included in the present study. The data related to the retraction status of the articles were extracted from the retraction notice and Retraction Watch, and the quality of the methodology was evaluated with the AMSTAR-2 checklist by two independent researchers. Data were analyzed in the Excel 2019 and SPSS 21 software.<h4>Result</h4>Of the 282 systematic reviews, the corresponding authors of 208 (73.75%) articles were from China. The average interval between publish and retraction of the article was about 23 months and about half of the non-Cochrane systematic reviews were retracted in the last 4 years. The most common reasons for retractions were fake peer reviews and unreliable data, respectively. Editors and publishers were the most retractors or requestors for retractions. More than 86% of the retracted non-Cochrane SRs were published in journals with an impact factor above two and had a critically low quality. Items 7, 9, and 13 among the critical items of the AMSTAR-2 checklist received the lowest scores.<h4>Discussion and conclusion</h4>There was a significant relationship between the reasons of retraction and the quality of the methodology (P-value < 0.05). Plagiarism software and using the Cope guidelines may decrease the time of retraction. In some countries, strict rules for promoting researchers increase the risk of misconduct. To avoid scientific errors and improve the quality of systematic reviews/meta-analyses (SRs/MAs), it is better to create protocol registration and retraction guidelines in each journal for SRs/MAs."

Abstract:
<h4>Background and aim</h4>Citations in academia have long been regarded as a fundamental means of acknowledging the contribution of past work and promoting scientific advancement. The aim of this paper was to investigate the impact that misconduct allegations made against scholars have on the citations of their work, comparing allegations of sexual misconduct (unrelated to the research merit) and allegations of scientific misconduct (directly related to the research merit).<h4>Methods</h4>We collected citation data from the Web of Science (WoS) in 2021, encompassing 31,941 publications from 172 accused and control scholars across 18 disciplines. We also conducted two studies: one on non-academics (N = 231) and one on academics (N = 240).<h4>Results</h4>The WoS data shows that scholars accused of sexual misconduct incur a significant citation decrease in the three years after the accusations become public, while we do not detect a significant citation decrease for scholars accused of scientific misconduct. The study involving non-academics suggests that individuals are more averse to sexual than to scientific misconduct. Finally, contrary to the WoS data findings, a sample of academics indicates they are more likely to cite scholars accused of sexual misconduct than those accused of scientific misconduct.<h4>Conclusions</h4>In the first three years after accusations became public, scholars accused of sexual misconduct incur a larger citation penalty than scholars accused of scientific misconduct. However, when asked to predict their citing behavior, scholars indicated the reverse pattern, suggesting they might mis-predict their behavior or be reluctant to disclose their preferences."

Abstract:
Performance-based financing (PBF) is a funding strategy that pays for outcomes rather than the cost of inputs. Verification through facility records (quantity verification) and patient interviews in communities (community verification) is a known cornerstone of PBF to ensure reported results are accurate. However, the literature suggests it's common to tie payment to quantity verification results, which measure internal record alignment but do not assess the validity of records (e.g., whether records represent delivered services). We sought to understand the extent to which reported voluntary medical male circumcisions (VMMCs) in a PBF program could be verified in facility records and with patients, and if the two sources aligned at the facility-level. We performed a mixed method verification including quantity verification and community verification to verify reported results for Population Services International's VMMC program in Zimbabwe from 2016 - 2018. We also interviewed verifiers to help understand the findings and we assessed the correlation between quantity and community verification performance scores at the facility-level to see whether facilities that have strong record keeping tended to also have strong validation from patients and vice versa. Among the 36,877 VMMCs selected from DHIS2 for quantity verification, 94% of records were sufficiently complete. Among records selected for community verification, only 55% (2,010/3,676) of patients were interviewed. Among those interviewed, 17% (342/2,010) provided answers that did not plausibly match the record. Verifiers reported that some patients admitted providing incorrect contact information to avoid follow-up and most verifiers suspected staff had fabricated data. We found no correlation between performance scores at the facility-level. Overall, results from the quantity verification were not a good proxy for the community verification. Programs that pay based on facility records alone risk overpaying for services and misreporting performance. To increase the use of community verification findings, PBF programs should consider using and improving our proposed results to action framework."

Abstract:
<h4>Background</h4>China is one of the top countries with the most significant number or proportion of retracted publications, which has garnered significant attention.<h4>Methods</h4>Using the Retraction Watch Database, we collected retracted articles written by Chinese authors from 31 provinces in mainland China, spanning the period between January 1, 2012, and December 31, 2023. We used Geographical Information Science to analyze spatial distribution characteristics of retracted articles by Chinese authors and identify high-risk clusters of retracted areas.<h4>Results</h4>A total of 14,445 retracted articles authored by researchers from 31 provinces in China between 2012 and 2023 were analyzed. The Spatial trend surface analysis and Gravity center movement indicated a gradual increase in the number of retracted articles from the west to the east. The spatial autocorrelation analysis showed that revealed significant spatial clustering in the distribution of retracted articles across the 31 provinces. The results of the spatial-temporal clustering analysis showed that the hotspots were primarily concentrated in Shandong, Jiangsu, Shanghai, Henan, and Anhui.<h4>Conclusion</h4>There is a discernible spatial clustering among these retractions, with a gradual increase in the number of retracted articles from west to east. Shandong, Jiangsu, Shanghai, Henan, and Anhui are the hotspots for retractions."

Abstract:
<h4>Precis</h4>  The integrity of evidence synthesis is threatened by problematic randomised controlled trials (RCTs). These are RCTs where there are serious concerns about the trustworthiness of the data or findings. This could be due to research misconduct, including fraud, or due to honest critical errors. If these RCTs are not detected, they may be inadvertently included in systematic reviews and guidelines, potentially distorting their results. To address this problem, the INSPECT-SR (INveStigating ProblEmatic Clinical Trials in Systematic Reviews) tool has been developed to assess the trustworthiness of RCTs. This will allow problematic RCTs to be identified and excluded from systematic reviews. This paper describes the development of INSPECT-SR. The tool and an associated guidance document are presented."

Abstract:
Evidence syntheses of randomized clinical trials (RCTs) offer the highest level of scientific evidence for informing clinical practice and policy. The value of evidence synthesis itself depends on the trustworthiness of the included RCTs. The rising number of retractions and expressions of concern about the authenticity of RCTs has raised awareness about the existence of problematic studies, sometimes called ""zombie"" trials. Research integrity, i.e., adherence to ethical and professional standards, is a multi-dimensional concept that is incompletely evaluated for the RCTs included in current evidence syntheses. Systematic reviewers tend to rely on the editorial and peer-review system established by journals as custodians of integrity of the RCTs they synthesize. It is now well established that falsified and fabricated RCTs are slipping through. Thus, RCT integrity assessment becomes a necessary step in systematic reviews going forward, in particular because RCTs with data-related integrity concerns remain available for use in evidence syntheses. There is a need for validated tools for systematic reviewers to proactively deploy in the assessment of integrity deviations without having to wait for RCTs to be retracted by journals or expressions of concern issued. This article analyzes the issues and challenges in conducting evidence syntheses where the literature contains RCTs with possible integrity deficits. The way forward in the form of formal RCT integrity assessments in systematic reviews is proposed, and implications of this new initiative are discussed. Future directions include emphasizing ethical and professional standards, providing tailored integrity-specific training, and creating systems to promote research integrity, as improvements in RCT integrity will benefit evidence syntheses."

Abstract:
As collaborative Machine Learning on cross-institutional, fully distributed networks become an important tool in predictive health modeling, its inherent security risks must be addressed. One among such risks is the lack of a mitigation strategy against injections of tampered models (or ""model misconduct"") into the collaborative pipeline, without excessive false alarms. We propose a false-positive tolerant methodology to preserve model integrity and mitigate the impacts of adversarial misconduct in a Federated Learning scenario. Our method grants false-positive detection leeway as each participating site would be quarantined only when their misbehavior allowance (or ""budget"") is exhausted, preventing over-ostracization and the subsequent loss of sample size. We evaluated our system on a decentralized blockchain network with three datasets. Our method demonstrated gains of 0.058-0.121 Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve when compared to the solution without false-positive tolerance, with negligible overhead (< 12 milliseconds). Our method can serve as an efficient and robust approach to safeguard the distributed Federated Learning process in collaborative healthcare, inheriting blockchain's characteristics of transparency and decentralization. Future work can apply our methodology to more sophisticated machine learning algorithms or scale the experiments in a large-scale learning scenario with more participating sites and larger sample sizes."

Abstract:
Systematic reviews are considered by many to constitute the highest level of scientific evidence. However, the methods used in a systematic review for combining information from multiple studies are predicated on all of the reports being truthful. For a systematic review of preclinical studies of depression, we found that potentially fraudulent studies-studies featuring problematic images suggestive of gross error or manipulation-were both common and capable of biasing our findings. The prevalence of problematic studies (we had concerns with 19% of all studies with images) and our inability to find a simple pattern for identifying them undermine systematic reviews within our research field. We suspect that this is symptomatic of a broader problem that needs immediate addressing."

Abstract:
Journals and publishers are increasingly using artificial intelligence (AI) to screen submissions for potential misconduct, including plagiarism and data or image manipulation. While using AI can enhance the integrity of published manuscripts, it can also increase the risk of false/unsubstantiated allegations. Ambiguities related to journals' and publishers' responsibilities concerning fairness and transparency also raise ethical concerns. In this Topic Piece, we offer the following guidance: (1) All cases of suspected misconduct identified by AI tools should be carefully reviewed by humans to verify accuracy and ensure accountability; (2) Journals/publishers that use AI tools to detect misconduct should use only well-tested and reliable tools, remain vigilant concerning forms of misconduct that cannot be detected by these tools, and stay abreast of advancements in technology; (3) Journals/publishers should inform authors about irregularities identified by AI tools and give them a chance to respond before forwarding allegations to their institutions in accordance with Committee on Publication Ethics guidelines; (4) Journals/publishers that use AI tools to detect misconduct should screen all relevant submissions and not just random/purposefully selected submissions; and (5) Journals should inform authors about their definition of misconduct, their use of AI tools to detect misconduct, and their policies and procedures for responding to suspected cases of misconduct."

Abstract:
This study presents a novel capillary microgripper for manipulating micrometer-sized objects directly within aqueous environments. The system features dynamic, vision-based feedback control of a non-volatile silicone oil droplet volume, enabling precise adjustment of the capillary bridge force for the adaptable capture of varying object sizes. This approach ensures extended working time and stable operation in water, mitigating the issues associated with evaporation common in other systems. COMSOL Multiphysics simulations analyzed capillary bridge formation. Experimental validation demonstrated successful different object shapes and sizes capture in an aqueous environment and further explored active release strategies necessary due to the non-volatile fluid, confirming the system potential for robust underwater micromanipulation."

Abstract:
In the last 20 years, there has been a sharp increase in the incidence of retractions of articles published in scientific journals, the majority of which are due to research misconduct. In some cases, researchers have revised and republished articles that were retracted due to misconduct, which raises some novel questions concerning authorship. Suppose that an article is retracted because one of the authors fabricated or falsified some data, but the researchers decide to salvage the useable data, make appropriate revisions, and resubmit the article for publication. If the person who committed misconduct has made a significant contribution to the research reported in the revised paper, should they be named as an author to recognize this contribution or should they be denied authorship because they committed misconduct? This is a challenging issue because it involves the confluence of two research ethics domains that are usually dealt with separately, i.e., resolution of authorship disputes and adjudication of misconduct findings, as well as potential conflicts among norms that underlie authorship practices and misconduct adjudication. In this paper, we (1) describe some actual cases involving articles that were retracted for misconduct and republished; (2) review policies from the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors, Committee on Publication Ethics, and top fifteen biomedical journals to determine whether they provide adequate guidance for cases like these; and (3) analyze the ethical and policy issues that may arise in these situations."

Abstract:
Surfaces become ""sticky"" at the micro/nano length scale as the gravitational force is no longer effective. Ultragentle, high-contrast switching of interfacial adhesion is the key to reliable small-scale object manipulation. Here, a novel approach is presented for surface adhesion control utilizing a liquid-permeable nanoporous surface, which can switch from off-state adhesion (< 0.002 kPa) to on-state attraction (0.8 kPa) without preload. The surface of the gripper is composed of vertically aligned composite nanowires with an average diameter of 79 nm. When a liquid is injected into the nanoporous membrane, capillary adhesion occurs, allowing the object to be picked up. As the liquid evaporates, the object can be released by extremely sparse contact. The off-state adhesion of a millimeter-scale gripper is even lower than the gravitational force of thin polymer films (0.18 mN cm<sup>-2</sup>), enabling the solid-contactless release of lightweight materials. We characterize and model the mechanism across length scales and provide pick-and-place demonstrations including LED chips, micro-architected materials, and thin-film electronics."

Abstract:
Science relies on integrity and trustworthiness. But scientists under career pressure are lured to purchase fake publications from 'paper mills' that use AI-generated data, text and image fabrication. The number of low-quality or fraudulent publications is rising to hundreds of thousands per year, which-if unchecked-will damage the scientific and economic progress of our societies. The result is editor and reviewer fatigue, irreproducible experiments, misguided experiments, disinformation and escalating costs that devour funding from taxpayers intended for research. It is high time to reevaluate current publishing models and outline a global plan to stop this unhealthy development. A conference was therefore organized by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences to draft an action plan with specific recommendations, as follows. (i) Academia should resume control of publishing using non-profit publishing models (e.g. diamond open-access). (ii) Adjust incentive systems to merit quality, not quantity, in a reputation economy where the gaming of publication numbers and citation metrics distorts the perception of academic excellence. (iii) Implement mechanisms to prevent and detect fake publications and fraud which are independent of publishers. (iv) Draft and implement legislations, regulations and policies to increase publishing quality and integrity. This is a call to action for universities, academies, science organizations and funders to unite and join this effort."

Abstract:
Scientific fraud represents, to varying degrees, an increasingly important part of medical literature and is estimated to make up nearly 20% of this literature. The increase in the number of articles accessible in preprint without peer review during the COVID-19 pandemic has led to an increase in the accessibility of fraudulent articles. In recent years, the viral increase in the number of predatory journals has contributed to polluting the scientific literature with articles whose content is unverifiable. Given the international nature of biomedical research, there is an urgent need to define unequivocally what is considered scientific fraud. In order to counter scientific misconduct, national and supranational procedures should be implemented to inform researchers at the beginning of their medical and biomedical training. Ethics commissions should implement local procedures for monitoring ongoing research. Finally, the fight against predatory journals requires information for researchers and the availability of tools to identify these journals."

Abstract:
<h4>Background and purpose</h4>Retraction is a significant consequence of scientific research, resulting from various factors ranging from unintentional errors to intentional misconduct. Previous reviews on retracted publications in obstetrics and gynecology have identified ""article duplication,"" ""plagiarism,"" and ""fabricated results"" as the main reasons for retraction. However, the extent of retracted articles in the literature on medically assisted reproduction (MAR) remains unclear. This systematic review aimed to assess the number and characteristics of retracted articles in the field of MAR.<h4>Methods</h4>The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines were followed for this study. A comprehensive literature search was conducted on the PubMed database from 1993 to February 2023, limited to English articles and including all 283 terms from the International Glossary on Infertility and Fertility Care. To identify retracted studies, a specific query combining the 283 terms from the glossary with a retraction-related keyword was used. Only studies focused on MAR and involving human subjects were included.<h4>Results</h4>The electronic search yielded a total of 523,067 records in the field of infertility and fertility care. Among these, a total of 2,458 records were identified as retracted. The citation retraction rate was found to be 0.47% (2,458/523,067; 95%CI 0.45-0.49), and the citation retraction rate for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) was 0.20% (93/45,616; 95%CI 0.16-0.25). A total of 39 retracted articles specifically related to MAR were identified. Among these, 41.0% were RCTs (<i>n</i> = 16), 15.4% were reviews (<i>n</i> = 6), and 10.3% were retrospective studies (<i>n</i> = 4) or prospective studies (<i>n</i> = 4). Most of the retractions occurred shortly after publication, with ""plagiarism"" being the most common reason for retraction, followed by ""duplicate publication.""<h4>Discussion</h4>The issue of retraction exists within the field of infertility and fertility care, including MAR. Our findings indicate that scientific misconduct, particularly plagiarism and duplicate publication, are the primary causes of retraction in MAR. Despite finding that the proportion of retracted citations is low, promoting scientific integrity should be a priority. The consequences of article retractions have significant implications for patient care and the scientific community. Hence, it is crucial to prioritize thorough screening of manuscripts before publication to maintain research integrity.<h4>Systematic review registration</h4>https://www.crd.york.ac."

Abstract:
Robotic micromanipulation has advanced cellular probing, yet achieving precise, minimally invasive intracellular operations without fluorescent labeling remains challenging. Fluorescent techniques often cause photodamage and cytotoxicity and interfere with downstream analyses. Here, we introduce an automated, multifunctional nanoprobing platform capable of label-free extraction of mitochondria from living cells with high spatiotemporal resolution. The nanoprobe integrates two individually addressable nanoelectrodes that perform electrochemical detection of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species, produced by mitochondrial metabolism, followed by dielectrophoretic trapping, manipulation, and extraction of mitochondria. We successfully demonstrated the extraction of mitochondria from living cells, which is validated through fluorescence labeling before and after extraction. Subsequent quantitative polymerase chain reaction further confirmed that the extracted sample contained mitochondria. The fusion of the transplanted mitochondria within the recipient cell's mitochondrial network confirms their activity. This automated, label-free, in situ organelle extraction micromanipulation system offers a powerful tool for understanding disease mechanisms linked to dysfunctional organelles and enables single-cell surgeries for organelle transplantation."

Abstract:
<h4>Background</h4>In primary health care, the dissemination of retracted publications through literature reviews, guidelines, and recommendations can have a significant and lasting impact. Despite this potential threat, the retraction consequences and patterns in this domain have not been extensively explored. Therefore, this study investigates the characteristics and ripple effects of retracted papers in primary health care literature.<h4>Methods</h4>Retracted publications indexed in PubMed from 1984 to 2022 in primary health care journals underwent bibliometric analysis. The dataset included detailed publication information, from which we derived annual retraction rates and examined trends by journal, authorship, and geographic origin. We further evaluated the extent of influence exerted by retracted papers through postretraction citation analysis.<h4>Results</h4>In 44 primary health care journals, 13 articles were retracted over the study period, representing a retraction rate of 0.01%-notably lower than the aggregate rate for all PubMed journals. Despite this, we observed a recent surge in retraction frequency, especially in the last decade. The median interval to retraction was 15 months, with scientific misconduct, specifically fabrication, and plagiarism, as the predominant reasons. After retraction, the articles continued to exert considerable influence, averaging 25 citations per article with a 78.1% postretraction citation prevalence.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Retractions resulting from scientific misconduct in primary health care are increasing, with a substantial portion of such work continuing to be cited. This trend underscores the urgent need to improve research ethics and develop mechanisms that help primary care physicians discern reliable information, thereby reducing the reliance on compromised literature."

Abstract:
Research integrity has become a pressing concern in China, which accounts for a large share of global retractions. Yet little is known about how research integrity is understood and enacted within teaching hospitals. In this cross-sectional study, we surveyed 106 medical researchers across four Shanghai hospitals to assess their awareness, attitudes, and practices regarding scientific misconduct, as well as the role of integrity education. Most respondents reported familiarity with definitions of fabrication, falsification, and plagiarism and expressed strong disapproval of these behaviors. Nonetheless, 11%-22% indicated some degree of tolerance toward selective reporting or unjustified authorship, and firsthand reports of witnessed misconduct were uncommon. Participation in formal courses or lectures on research integrity was associated with higher knowledge scores and stronger agreement with ethical principles. These findings reveal a tension between high awareness and partial tolerance, highlighting the importance of exploring how institutional cultures and incentive systems may influence ethical behavior in future research and policy efforts."

Abstract:
INTRODUCTION: Title IX prohibits sex- and gender-based discrimination in federally funded education programs, yet its application in experiential learning remains inconsistent. Decentralized clinical sites and unclear enforcement structures may leave learners in off-campus experiential placements vulnerable to harassment and inequitable learning experiences.
COMMENTARY: Ambiguity in Title IX's coverage, variable preceptor training, and limited university oversight create gaps in learner protections. Evidence suggests many external sites lack required orientation or understanding of reporting responsibilities, increasing the risk of unaddressed concerns or misconduct.
IMPLICATIONS: Without clearer policy guidance, experiential learners may continue to face unsafe and discriminatory environments with inadequate recourse. Strengthening Title IX implementation may require reimagining current orientation processes, training, standardized reporting processes, and enhanced institutional accountability to ensure safe, equitable experiential learning."

Abstract:
Irreproducible and fraudulent research is an enormous problem that decreases the public's trust in biomedical science. Unfortunately, infectious disease (ID) research has not escaped the reproducibility crisis and investigator maleficence. This article describes the scope of the problem, explores some of the reasons why investigators commit research fraud, and discusses the surprising lack of oversight by relevant stakeholders including the National Institutes of Health (NIH), scientific journals, and academic institutions. Finally, a novel solution for tackling fraud in ID research is proposed."

Abstract:
BACKGROUND: Lipids play essential roles in food systems, and their study through lipidomics offers insights into biochemical processes and issues such as food fraud and adulteration. Among lipid classes, glycerolipids (GLs), particularly triacylglycerols (TAGs), are the most frequently analysed in food-related studies.
RESULTS: Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS) and MALDI mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) have emerged as powerful tools for lipidomic investigations. While traditionally applied in biological research, their use in food science is expanding to diverse matrices, including oils, dairy, cereals, algae, and meat. In terms of MALDI matrices, 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid (DHB) is most commonly used in positive ion mode, whereas 9-aminoacridine (9-AA) is typically employed in negative mode. MALDI-MS has advanced lipid characterization, and MALDI-MSI now enables mapping of lipid spatial distributions, revealing processes such as lipid degradation.
SIGNIFICANCE: This review underscores the growing utility of MALDI-MS and MALDI-MSI for lipid analysis in food science. We highlight their analytical capabilities, workflows, and limitations, it demonstrates how these techniques can enhance understanding of food composition, quality, and authenticity."

Abstract:
A keratin-degrading bacterium, Bacillus licheniformis CP-16 (B.licheniformis CP-16), isolated from feather waste, was found to produce three extracellular proteins with protease activity. Following mass spectrometry sequencing and BLAST analysis, these proteins exhibited high similarity to γ-glutamyl transpeptidase, alkaline serine protease and thioredoxin-like protein YkuU, respectively. Genes of the three proteins and Ker A from B.licheniformis were successfully cloned into pET22b and expressed in Escherichia coli (E coli), and the four recombinant enzymes were named P-Glu, P-Alk, P-Trx, and P-Ker. P-ker showed great keratinase activity (4.9 kU/mg) and casein protease activity (6.5 kU/mg), as P-Alk showed keratinase activity (1.2 kU/mg) and casein protease activity (23 kU/mg). In contrast, both P-Glu and P-Trx displayed low levels of keratinase and casein protease activities. P-Trx had disulfide bond reductase activity (3 U/mg). When mixing with P-Trx, the other three proteases, P-Glu, P-Alk, P-Ker degraded feather keratin with keratinase activity promotion of 71%, 40% and 71%. Commercial proteases (trypsin and chymotrypsin) also got keratinolytic capacity after mixing with P-Trx. These findings reveal a novel synergistic mechanism between P-Trx and other proteases in the degradation of feather keratin, leading to more efficient keratin breakdown."

PMID: 41544279

Journal: American family physician

Publication Date: 2026 Jan

Authors: Katie L Buel, Emily Gould


Abstract:
Newborn respiratory distress is one of the most common reasons for neonatal intensive care admission at birth. If not diagnosed and managed appropriately, newborn respiratory distress can progress to cardiopulmonary collapse and death. Presenting symptoms of respiratory distress consist of increased work of breathing (eg, grunting, nasal flaring, cyanosis, retractions, respiratory rate greater than 60 breaths/min [tachypnea]). The most common cause of respiratory distress at term is transient tachypnea of the newborn. Other causes include respiratory distress syndrome, meconium aspiration syndrome, pneumonia, and sepsis. Less common causes are pneumothorax, congenital heart disease, and congenital diaphragmatic hernia. Physicians attending deliveries should be familiar with current neonatal resuscitation guidelines. If respiratory distress does not resolve after stabilization in the delivery room, chest radiography, supplemental oxygen, and appropriate laboratory tests (eg, complete blood cell count, blood cultures, C-reactive protein, blood gas measurement) should be considered. The Early-Onset Sepsis Calculator can help guide decision-making for neonates who may require antibiotic therapy."

Abstract:
INTRODUCTION: The impact of unprofessional behavior in medical training has been well-documented, with studies linking it to increased professional misconduct later in clinical practice, including breaches of ethical standards and license revocations. Notably, students with documented professionalism violations during physician assistant (PA) training face a 5-fold increase in the likelihood of postgraduate disciplinary actions. The condensed nature of PA education, averaging 27 months, compared with 4 years of medical school, reduces opportunities for identifying and remediating such behaviors. A review of the literature highlighted best practices in evaluating professionalism and informed the design of a program-level intervention.
METHODS: The program implemented a multilayered professionalism assessment strategy based on insights from the literature. Core components included peer evaluation, faculty advising and documentation, mentorship, preceptor feedback, and structured self-reflection. Effectiveness was assessed by comparing professional remediation rates before and after implementation and by surveying students on the perceived value of the peer professionalism tool.
RESULTS: Following implementation, a measurable reduction in professionalism remediation was observed. Survey data also indicated that students valued peer evaluation as a meaningful component of their professional development.
DISCUSSION: The multilayered approach frames professionalism as a developmental process rather than a fixed marker of competence. Early, repeated interventions across multiple advisory meetings created opportunities for professional development and guided targeted remediation strategies. Embedding this model within PA education encourages sustained professional growth and better prepares students for the responsibilities of clinical practice."

Abstract:
<p>Following the publication of the above paper, it was drawn to the Editor's attention by a concerned reader that certain of the western blot data shown in Fig. 2C on p. 5104 were strikingly similar to data appearing in different form in another article written by different authors at different research institutes that had already been published in the journal Oncogene. An independent analysis of the data in this paper made by the Editorial Office further revealed that other western blot data in the same figure had appeared in a number of other papers written by different authors that had also been published previously; furthermore, there were internally duplicated data among the western blots in Figs. 1‑5, and potential anomalies concerning the assembly of the data in these figures. Owing to the fact that the contentious data mentioned above had already apparently been published previously, the Editor of Molecular Medicine Reports has decided that this paper should be retracted from the Journal. The authors were asked for an explanation to account for these concerns, but the Editorial Office did not receive a reply. The Editor apologizes to the readership for any inconvenience caused.

Abstract:
<p>Subsequently to the publication of the above paper, a concerned reader has drawn to the Editor's attention that, for the immunohistochemical data shown in Fig. 2E, the same data panel had apparently been included for the 'ZEB1/Con' and 'SEB2/Min' experiments. In addition, for the Snail2 experiments shown in Fig. 3A, the Snail Con(trol) and Snail Mimi panels looked strikingly similar, even though the intensity of the antibody (red) channel appeared to have been decreased in the Mimi panel. Finally, for the immunohistochemical images shown in Fig. 3C, the E‑cadherin Con(trol) and Scr panels appeared to show a region of overlap, suggesting that these data were derived from the same original source, where the results of differently performed experiments were intended to have been portrayed. Given that it has come to light that this trio of figures had apparently been assembled incorrectly, which might have had an adverse effect on the interpretation of the results and conclusions in the article, the Editor of Oncology Reports has decided that this paper should be retracted from the Journal on account of a lack of confidence in the presented data.

Abstract:
Neurophysiological recordings from non-human primates (NHPs) have traditionally relied on rigid microelectrode arrays made from stainless steel or silicon. While these devices enable high-quality recordings, a fundamental mechanical mismatch between rigid materials and soft brain tissue leads to inflammation, gliosis, and signal instability. In particular, brain micromotion causes continuous drifting of neurons relative to fixed electrodes, compromising single-unit tracking during both chronic and acute recordings. Flexible, penetrating electrodes offer a promising solution, but their adoption in NHPs has been hindered by the technical challenges of delivering ultra-thin polymers through thick dura mater. Here, we demonstrate a comprehensive approach for acute, repeated recordings in awake, behaving NHPs using flexible arrays. We fabricated a microelectrode array that spans cortical layers with 32 cellular-scale recording sites embedded in 7 μm-thick Parylene-C. We developed a novel ""telescopic"" insertion method that combines concentric guide tubes with a retractable microwire shuttle. Our technique is compatible with standard chronic recording chambers and allowed for repeated penetration of free-floating arrays through intact dura over weeks without the need for a new craniotomy. Across two awake rhesus macaques, we optimized the electrode geometry and insertion procedure to achieve an 80% single-unit recording success rate. As animals performed an oculomotor delayed response task, we recorded task-responsive neurons from prefrontal and posterior parietal cortex with stable single-unit activity throughout 1-2-hour behavioral sessions. Critically, by comparing our flexible arrays to rigid probes in the same animals and recording chambers, we provide quantitative evidence that flexible electrodes reduce total single-unit drift from hundreds to tens of microns. Our work establishes flexible microelectrode arrays as a practical, dependable technology for NHP neuroscience and paves the way toward long-term, ultra-stable neurophysiology in large animal models."

Abstract:
Rotator cuff tears are commonly seen in athletes and older adults. Rotator cuff arthropathy (RCA), the end stage of untreated or neglected massive rotator cuff tears, leads to debilitating restriction of shoulder movements. The condition typically occurs in the seventh decade of life. While the entity can be suspected clinically, imaging clinches the diagnosis and guides the appropriate management. However, it may be missed by the radiologist on a radiograph, and sometimes on magnetic resonance imaging as well, where the findings of cuff tears take apparent priority in the impression over those of arthropathy. The inexperienced radiologist may also fail to mention findings important for surgical decision-making, such as muscle atrophy, fatty infiltration of muscles, and the location of the retracted end of the cuff tendons. This review article aims to provide teaching points on the correct diagnosis, and the importance of relevant and comprehensive reporting of such cases for timely management."

Abstract:
Proximal hamstring avulsions, often seen in active adults, result from high-energy eccentric loading during hip flexion with knee extension. Open repair remains the gold standard, allowing direct visualization and sciatic nerve protection. Low-profile all-suture anchors have emerged as an alternative to traditional metal or PEEK (polyether ether ketone) devices. This technical note describes a reproducible technique using 3 Q-Fix all-suture anchors (Smith & Nephew, London, England) in a triangular tension-slide configuration. This construct offers strong anatomic fixation with minimal implant burden and reduced bone loss. It is particularly advantageous in cases of tendon retraction or poor tissue quality and is broadly adaptable, including for high-demand populations."

Abstract:
Hip abductor tendon tears are a common cause of lateral hip pain and gait disturbance, especially in older adults. While conservative treatment is first-line, high failure rates often necessitate surgical intervention. Chronic, retracted tears with poor tendon quality pose a surgical challenge. In such cases, transfer of the anterior portion of the gluteus maximus and tensor fascia lata is a viable option. This Technical Note describes the surgical approach for managing chronic, retracted tears combining gluteus maximus-tensor fascia lata transfer and abductor tendon double-row repair with bioinductive collagen scaffold augmentation."

Abstract:
We describe an arthroscopic technique utilizing the long head of the biceps tendon (LHBT) for U-fold reconstruction of the upper articular capsule in treating irreparable massive rotator cuff tears. For patients with irreparable massive rotator cuff tears but intact LHBT, the U-fold LHBT is further sutured to the retracted rotator cuff tissues to achieve bridging. This technique aims to reinforce the superior capsular constraint and facilitate integration with the remaining rotator cuff tissue. It emphasizes graft preparation and fixation without the need for additional biomaterials, offering a potential alternative in the surgical treatment of irreparable massive rotator cuff defects."

Abstract:
Plant reproductive organ development is governed by complex transcriptional regulatory networks formed by ABC-class MADS-box genes. Nevertheless, how the ABC-class MADS-box genes working together with other genes to specify the reproductive organ shape are largely unknown. Here, we demonstrate that common buckwheat MADS-box gene FaesAP3_1 or FaesAG is directly activated by an R2R3-MYB transcription factor FaesMYB15 as a genetic downstream target, while FaesAP1_1, FaesAP3_2, FaesPI_1 or FaesPI_2 is directly repressed by FaesMYB15 as a genetic downstream target during stamen and pistil development. Furthermore, FaesMYB15 expression is directly repressed by two AP2-type TFs FaesAP2 and FaesTOE, up-regulate expression of FaesMYB15 leads to filament-length decreased in pFaesMYB15::FaesMYB15 transgenic LH common buckwheat, while silencing FaesMYB15 results in obvious style length decreased both in red and white flower LH common buckwheat, which indicating that FaesMYB15 plays key role involved in common buckwheat filament-/style-length determination. Moreover, up-regulate expression of FaesMYB15 also results in dark red anther-color of white flower pFaesMYB15::FaesMYB15 transgenic LH common buckwheat, while FaesMYB15 expression knockdown leads to lighter tepal-color of red color flower without obvious anther-color change and lighter anther-color of white flower LH F. esculentum, suggesting different floral color pattern governed by FaesMYB15 between red and white flower common buckwheat. Our findings collectively offered new insights into the role of R2R3-MYB TF FaesMYB15 within the transcriptional regulatory network governing common buckwheat floral shape and color."

Abstract:
While platelets for transfusion are traditionally stored at room temperature (20-24°C), cryopreservation at -80°C is attractive, as it facilitates an extension of the shelf-life from 7 days to several years. Cryopreserved platelets display enhanced procoagulant capacity, which may distort the balance between clot formation and resolution. Platelets were frozen at -80°C using DMSO and thawed and resuspended in fresh plasma before testing. Fresh components (day 1) were tested in parallel. The supernatant of thawed platelets contained a higher concentration of fibrinogen, plasminogen, TAFI, FXIII, PAI-1, and tPA, compared to fresh platelets. However, this was primarily due to the addition of fresh plasma at the time of platelet thawing, with the exception of PAI-1. Thawed platelets displayed a higher surface abundance of PAI-1 and FXIII, compared to fresh platelets. The clots formed by thawed platelets underwent retraction; although this was affected by time and platelet concentration. tPA-induced fibrinolysis, measured by thromboelastography (TEG), was not statistically different between fresh and thawed platelets. Although differences in the abundance of fibrinolytic mediators were observed in thawed platelets, compared to room temperature platelets, clot resolution properties were conserved. This work provides a more complete understanding of the overall hemostatic capacity of cryopreserved platelets."

Abstract:
BACKGROUND: The 2023 armed conflict in Sudan disrupted higher education and forced a sudden shift to remote learning. This transition altered students' physical habits, posture, and daily routines, potentially increasing the risk of musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs). Evidence regarding the musculoskeletal impact of such disruption among medical students in conflict-affected contexts remains scarce.
OBJECTIVE: To assess the prevalence, patterns, and predictors of musculoskeletal symptoms among Sudanese medical students engaged in remote learning during the 2023-2024 conflict.
METHOD: We conducted a cross-sectional study between May and August 2024 among 421 medical students who were engaged in remote learning during the conflict across more than 15 Sudanese universities. Participants completed a validated online questionnaire adapted from a Greek study.Data collected included demographics, remote learning habits, posture, and musculoskeletal complaints. Paired data were analyzed using McNemar's chi-squared test and paired t-tests, while group comparisons were conducted using the Kruskal-Wallis test and Pearson's chi-square test. Results are reported with 95% confidence intervals (CI).
RESULTS: Participants' mean age was 22.3 ± 2.3 years; 71% were female. Physical inactivity increased from 25% (95% CI [21%, 30%]) before the conflict to 45% (95% CI [41%, 50%]) during it (p < 0.001). Daily musculoskeletal pain prevalence rose from 23% (95% CI [19%, 27%]) to 32% (95% CI [27%, 37%]) (p < 0.001), and mean pain intensity increased from 3.4 ± 2.0 (95% CI [3.2, 3.6]) to 4.4 ± 2.2 (95% CI [4.2, 4.6]). Prolonged screen exposure (>6 hours/day) was significantly associated with higher pain frequency (P-value = 0.020).
CONCLUSIONS: MSDs were highly prevalent among Sudanese medical students during conflict-related remote learning. Female gender, poor ergonomic posture, and extended screen time were major associated factors. The findings emphasize the need for ergonomic awareness programs, structured physical activity, and improved learning setups in conflict and low-resource settings."

Abstract:
The continuous evolution of food analysis is being pushed by the integration of cutting-edge liquid and gas chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS and GC-MS/MS), which have transcended the limitations of traditional analytical techniques through their exceptional sensitivity, specificity, and throughput. This review presents a critical and forward-looking overview of recent advancements in LC-MS/MS and GC-MS/MS technologies, emphasizing their pivotal roles in addressing contemporary challenges in food safety surveillance, fraud detection, nutritional profiling, and overall quality assurance. In parallel, the emergence of advanced chemometric strategies spanning multivariate statistics, machine learning, and artificial intelligence has redefined how complex datasets are processed, interpreted, and visualized, enabling more robust, high-resolution insights into food composition and integrity. By synthesizing the latest developments in both instrumentation and data science, this review highlights the synergistic potential of analytical chemistry and chemometrics to set new standards in foodomics, traceability, and risk assessment. Ultimately, these innovations contribute to greater transparency, regulatory compliance, and consumer trust in the global food supply chain."

Abstract:
Thrombosis is central to cardiovascular disease, yet current therapies are limited by inefficient drug delivery, poor thrombus targeting, and bleeding risk. Here we present a biomimetic platelet membrane-coated liposomal nanoplatform (SK-PLT) that integrates natural pharmacologic activity with targeted delivery. In a high-throughput screen of 171 natural products, shikonin (SK) inhibited platelet aggregation induced by ADP, thrombin, and collagen, with inhibition rates of 83.3%, 73.5%, and 81.6%, respectively. SK was then loaded into liposomes formulated with ginsenoside Rg3, which provides intrinsic antiplatelet activity and improves liposomal stability. The platelet membrane coating preserved key adhesion receptors and endowed SK-PLT with high affinity for activated platelets and thrombi. In vitro, SK-PLT nearly abolished aggregation, adhesion, spreading, and clot retraction, and showed good hemocompatibility. In mouse models of carotid arterial thrombosis and deep vein thrombosis, SK-PLT accumulated at thrombi, decreased carotid vessel occlusion from 91.7% to 13.3%, and reduced venous thrombus weight from 37.6 mg to 19.2 mg, leading to recovery of local blood flow. Overall antithrombotic efficacy was comparable to ticagrelor, but SK-PLT caused less prolongation of bleeding time and lower systemic toxicity. This combination of pharmacologic activity and biomimetic targeting supports SK-PLT as a precise antithrombotic strategy with translational potential."

Abstract:
PURPOSE/SIGNIFICANCE: This study investigates the awareness, perceptions, and responses of library and information science (LIS) researchers toward retracted papers, aiming to inform the improvement of research integrity governance.
METHOD/PROCESS: A questionnaire survey of 280 LIS researchers examined their sources of retraction information, understanding of causes, perceived consequences, and attitudes toward evaluation. The influence of academic background, publication volume, and discipline was also explored.
RESULT/CONCLUSION: Findings indicate generally low retraction awareness and a primary reliance on informal channels. Critically, the analysis reveals several nuanced patterns: (1) Significant disciplinary differences exist in perceiving retraction causes; (2) Opinions are sharply divided on including retraction records in research evaluation, reflecting concerns about uniform responsibility attribution; (3) A considerable proportion of researchers mistakenly view retraction's impact as reversible. These attitudes are strongly associated with educational background and publication experience. In response, this paper proposes five key recommendations: establishing authoritative retraction platforms, improving journal retraction mechanisms, differentiating retraction types in evaluation, strengthening integrity education, and building a coordinated governance framework. These measures contribute to fostering a more transparent, fair, and sustainable scholarly correction ecosystem."

Abstract:
Angle Class II division 1 malocclusion is a type of malocclusion that significantly impacts the psychological health of adolescents. The key to treating Angle Class II division 1 malocclusion lies in targeting the peak pubertal growth period and fully utilizing the mandible's growth potential. We present the case of a 10-year-old boy diagnosed with Angle Class II division 1 malocclusion, characterized by a severe overjet of 15 mm, managed through a two-phase orthodontic treatment. Phase I of the treatment involved maxillary expansion to eliminate mandibular growth restrictions and retract the proclined anterior teeth. Phase II comprised comprehensive orthodontics with the extraction of four premolars to achieve further anterior retraction, improve the convex soft tissue profile, and establish a harmonious occlusion. After 25 months of this two-phase treatment, significant improvement in the soft tissue profile was observed, with effective anterior retraction, well-aligned dentition, and functional occlusion."

Abstract:
BACKGROUND: Failure to declare a conflict of interest (COI) may bias research outcomes and undermine the integrity of readers' decision-making. This study aims to examine common practices in health sciences where COIs were inadequately disclosed.
METHODS: We identified and analyzed papers with post-publication COI issues by searching PubMed/MEDLINE, Web of Science and Retraction Watch Databases.
RESULTS: A total of 328 medical papers were identified with COI issues. Among them, 128 (39.0%) articles were retracted, 53 (16.2%) received expressions of concern, and 147 (44.8%) were corrected. Most actions (224, 68.2%) were initiated by editors or publishers. Despite these issues, papers reached a median of 4 post-publication citations. Of 189 papers failing to declare financial COIs, 33.8% were retracted, while 61.2% received corrections or expressions of concern.
CONCLUSIONS: Journals should adopt more detailed guidelines for COI disclosures and standardizing retraction notices to improve transparency. There is an urgent need for robust mechanisms to address potential COI issues effectively and to encourage authors to disclose COI transparently. Furthermore, to mitigate the risk of retractions, expressions of editorial concern, or corrections, these disclosure protocols must remain enforceable even post-publication."

Abstract:
Federated Learning (FL) enables multiple clients to cooperatively train models without sharing local data, where clients send trained local models to a server for aggregation. Although FL improves data privacy by keeping each client's training data local, the security of federated learning can be compromised by untrusted servers. Specifically, untrusted servers may infer clients' private identities and data information from the provided parameters and incorrectly execute the aggregation protocol to falsify the aggregation results. Therefore, to ensure the security and model accuracy of the federated learning scheme, we must protect the privacy of clients' information and mitigate the impact of untrusted servers. To defend against the possibility that an attacker may infer the client's privacy information from the partial model parameters provided by the client, we propose a partial model parameter security defense scheme based on group shuffling of parameter fragments. The scheme performs fragmentation operations on parameters and performs differential privacy perturbation on parameter fragments, so that the attacker can only access partial model parameter information and cannot obtain the complete model parameters. And in order to prevent the attacker from being able to reverse-engineer the client's identity information from the shared parameters, we also propose a group shuffling model to disrupt the order of the perturbed parameter fragments. Experimental results show that the average test accuracy of this scheme outperforms the FL-CDP, FL-LDP and AdaComp schemes by about 1.30%, 0.09% and 0.03%, respectively, thus ensuring the global training accuracy of the model while fending off attacks on local model parameters."

Abstract:
Technical note-2 illustrative cases. Suturing delicate structures risks iatrogenic damage from excessive exposure. Traditional methods, such as incisions and tissue retraction, can lead to adhesion, scarring, and impairment. We describe the reverse exposure-limiting suture (RELS) as a suture-burying maneuver facilitating controlled approximation while minimizing tissue exposure. RELS was applied to a proximal nail-bed laceration and a Zone 2 flexor tendon injury. The needle is first passed through the defect, then reversed beneath the overlying structure with the swage leading, allowing approximation without elevating protective tissues (such as eponychium) or releasing pulleys. As reversing the needle via the swage may theoretically increase tissue trauma, the technique should be applied cautiously in delicate regions. Both cases healed uneventfully: normal nail regrowth at 6 weeks (case 1) and excellent early function without pulley compromise at 3 months (case 2). Initial experience suggests that RELS is feasible in anatomically constrained regions; further study is needed to define its efficacy and stiffness, which may potentially compromise indications, safety, and outcomes."

Abstract:
BACKGROUND: White matter hyperintensities (WMH) are common MRI markers of cerebral small vessel disease, and systemic inflammation may contribute to their development.
PURPOSE: To investigate the association between blood inflammatory markers and WMH burden.
DATA SOURCES: PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library (January 2010-January 2025).
STUDY SELECTION: Studies reporting blood inflammatory biomarkers and quantitative WMH burden on brain MRI were included. Studies not published in English, nonhuman studies, retracted publications, reviews, and reports without extractable data were excluded. Of 392 records, 309 unique records were screened; 29 studies met inclusion criteria, and 11 were included in the meta-analysis (n = 8846).
DATA ANALYSIS: Study and patient characteristics, WMH volume, and sample size were extracted. Methodological quality was assessed with MINORS and certainty of evidence with GRADE.
DATA SYNTHESIS: Random-effects meta-analysis and meta-regression were performed. Heterogeneity was substantial (I2 = 99.9%), and the pooled mean WMH volume was 2576.4 mm³ (95% CI, 2391.4-2761.4). In univariate meta-regression, age (β = 356.1; 95% CI, 125.5-586.2; P = .002) and diabetes (β = 652.4; 95% CI, 370.5-934.3; P < .001) were associated with greater WMH burden; in multivariate analysis, only diabetes remained significant (β = 442.0; 95% CI, 98.7-785.3; P = .01). CRP was not significantly associated with WMH volume.
LIMITATIONS: The overall certainty of evidence was low and between-study heterogeneity was high.
CONCLUSIONS: Diabetes and aging may be associated with higher WMH burden, whereas CRP showed no significant association.

Abstract:
Pulmonary nodules are commonly detected during routine lung cancer screening on low-dose chest computed tomography (CT) or incidentally on other imaging. Approximately 1.6 million people in the United States are diagnosed with pulmonary nodules annually, with most being asymptomatic. The etiology of pulmonary nodules ranges from benign to malignant, necessitating a structured approach to evaluation. The US Preventive Services Task Force recommends lung cancer screening for high-risk individuals because it reduces lung cancer mortality. Management of pulmonary nodules relies on statistical models to estimate malignancy risk by incorporating radio-graphic features and clinical history. The Fleischner Society provides guidelines for managing incidentally detected nodules, whereas the Lung CT Screening Reporting and Data System offers a framework for risk stratification and surveillance. Radiographic characteristics suggestive of malignancy include part-solid or ground-glass appearance, large nodule size, spiculated margins, vascular convergence, and pleural retraction. Risk factors such as smoking history, older age, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cancer history, and environmental or occupational expo-sure to toxins further increase the probability of malignancy. Management strategies are dependent on malignancy risk and may include serial imaging for low-risk nodules and invasive procedures such as biopsy or surgical resection for high-risk lesions. Referral to a specialist is warranted for nodules with a high likelihood of malignancy or if tissue diagnosis is required."

Abstract:
Protein-DNA condensates mediate transcription and regulate gene expression and DNA replication and repair. Intermolecular bridging forces stabilizing condensates have direct roles in these processes. Here, we use optical tweezers to measure bridging forces. In the presence of protamine, a single condensate is observed on a 20.5-knt single-stranded DNA (ssDNA). Stretching produces force curves with a sawtooth pattern, suggesting condensate disassembly via sequential rupture of individual protamine-ssDNA bridges. The bridging forces are 11.3 ± 4.6 pN, with unfolding lengths of 1.3 ± 0.8 µm per bridge. In contrast, double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) forms protamine-mediated tangles that can withstand strand-separation forces (~60 pN). ssDNA tracks unpeeled at nicks on dsDNA by overstretching seed tangle formation upon retraction, but the initial condensates have a sufficient ssDNA-to-dsDNA ratio to appear liquid-like, as indicated by a sawtooth pattern in subsequent stretching. The presence of dsDNA raises bridging forces to 34 ± 8 pN, which revert to ~10 pN upon adding external ssDNA. In line with these single-molecule results, protamine-dsDNA mixtures form solid-like aggregates and require ssDNA addition to become liquid droplets. Conversely, adding dsDNA slows the fusion of protamine-ssDNA droplets. This work reports systematic characterization of bridging forces and shows that the ssDNA-to-dsDNA ratio can tune their magnitude in protein-DNA condensates."

Abstract:
BACKGROUND: Academic integrity is presented as a complex, multidimensional concept that involves all members of an educational institution. However, non-teaching staff members are often excluded from research on academic integrity. I engaged in professional support alongside academic staff to explore how academic integrity is understood within the Mauritius branch of a UK higher education institution.
METHODS: I adopted a qualitative approach to engage those tasked with implementing academic integrity to examine how they understood and practised it. Data were gathered through face-to-face focus-group interviews, which were translated into themes.
RESULTS: This article identified the factors that make academic integrity challenging and presents recommendations for practitioners and researchers.
CONCLUSIONS: More energy should be invested in the processes that build cultures of integrity rather than focusing on the opposite, such as cheating, plagiarism, and misconduct. Academic integrity is ultimately a positive values-driven approach to learning and a skill that can be developed and strengthened."

Abstract:
The scientific community is currently grappling with the ""reproducibility crisis,"" a phenomenon characterized by a significant loss of validity in research outcomes and a subsequent decline in public and scientific confidence. This crisis is evident in the high rate of studies, particularly within medicine and the humanities that fail replication tests and exhibit poor generalizability. This study aimed to specifically examine the issues of reproducibility in medical education research in Iran and propose effective solutions to address this challenge. This investigation employed a qualitative methodology, utilizing conventional content analysis. Data were collected through in-depth, semi-structured interviews with a carefully selected group of 24 medical science professors. Interviewing continued until data saturation was achieved, with each session lasting between 60 and 90 min. The analysis was systematically performed using the established Graneheim and Lundman's framework. The analysis led to the identification of three themes: factors contributing to the reproducibility crisis, its consequences, and potential solutions. These themes were further divided into eight categories. Contributing factors encompassed research methodology, various forms of bias, and contextual elements. The consequences were primarily reflected in two domains-scientific progress and decision-making in educational contexts. In contrast, proposed solutions centered on enhancing methodological rigor and reinforcing a culture of accountability and oversight in research practice. According to the findings, improving the quality and credibility of research in medical education requires a comprehensive strategy built upon three key pillars: advancing researchers' methodological competence, institutionalizing ethical and transparent research practices, and strengthening systems of evaluation and accountability. The effective implementation of initiatives such as the development of clear research guidelines, organization of training and capacity-building workshops, and promotion of robust inter-institutional collaboration can play a vital role in enhancing the quality, reliability, and trustworthiness of medical education research in Iran."

Abstract:
Electroencephalographic (EEG) decoding relies heavily on second-order (covariance) structure that lives on the manifold of symmetric positive-definite (SPD) matrices. Conventional deep networks in Euclidean space ignore this geometry, distorting geodesic relations between covariances; classical Riemannian pipelines respect SPD metrics but typically use fixed projections and a single global tangent embedding, which limits task adaptivity and incurs cubic costs in the channel dimension. We propose a fully geometry-consistent architecture that preserves manifold structure end-to-end while remaining trainable at scale. A compact depthwise-separable convolutional neural network (CNN) produces features whose regularized covariances lie on the SPD manifold. A learnable orthonormal projection, optimized on the Stiefel manifold via Riemannian stochastic gradient descent (SGD) with QR-factorization (QR) retraction, reduces dimensionality without breaking positive-definiteness and preserves an eigenvalue floor. We then perform tangent space graph-SPD aggregation on a scalp $k$ -nearest-neighbor graph-neighbor covariances are transported to the reference tangent space, attention-averaged, and mapped back via the exponential-followed by a log-Euclidean mapping and linear softmax classification. This Stiefel $\!\to $ Graph-SPD $\!\to \log $ chain explains why full geometric consistency matters: it avoids Euclidean shortcuts, keeps all intermediates SPD, and makes log/exp costs cubic in the reduced rank $d$ . In cross-subject evaluation on three public datasets, the model attains ${83}.{2}\%\!/\!{81}.{5}\%\!/\!{79}.{7}\%$ accuracy with improved macro- ${F}_{{1}}$ , strong separability (macro-AUROC $\approx {0}.{90}$ ), and well-calibrated probabilities (ECE $\le {0}.{04}$ ), outperforming strong Euclidean CNNs and Riemannian baselines while remaining computationally pragmatic."

Abstract:
Research misconduct practices like fabrication, falsification and plagiarism (FFP) are serious deviations from good research conduct, which have attracted attention in the literature due to the damage they can bring to science and society. However, less is known about the grey zone of researchers' behaviours that deviate from responsible research conduct but do not fall under serious research misconduct practices. These are known as questionable research practices (QRPs), and they are believed to pose a no less serious threat to research integrity and science. Despite increasing research on the topic, the extent of the problem in different research fields and contexts is unknown. Using a sample of researchers working in Portuguese universities in six main fields of research (n = 1573), we report on QRPs that researchers admit to and how serious they perceive them to be, and on predictors of engagement in QRPs. We find that QRPs are widespread across all fields of research and seniority levels. Yet, younger, more prolific researchers, and those dismissing the seriousness of QRPs admitted to more QRPs. This suggests that some groups are at higher risk of misconduct and that there is a need for studying the motivations behind more susceptible groups to engage in QRPs."

Abstract:
PD-L1 is a key immune checkpoint ligand that suppresses antitumor immunity by engaging PD-1 on T cells. While therapeutic blockade of PD-L1/PD-1 interactions has shown clinical benefit, many patients fail to respond, indicating modulation by other factors. Here, we identified a novel regulatory axis in which the membrane-organizing protein tetraspanin-4 (TSPAN4) modulates PD-L1 in melanoma cells. Using cell surface proximity biotinylation coupled with mass spectrometry, we discovered that TSPAN4 physically associates with PD-L1, with both proteins colocalizing on migrasomes and retraction fibers. Mechanistically, we show that TSPAN4 negatively regulates PD-L1 protein levels by enhancing its degradation and restricting its lateral mobility at the plasma membrane. Loss of TSPAN4 stabilized PD-L1, promoted its interaction with CMTM6, and increased PD-L1 surface availability for PD-1 binding. Functionally, TSPAN4 knockdown in melanoma cells led to more efficient immune checkpoint blockade through PD-1 on T cells. This study identifies TSPAN4 as a negative regulator of PD-L1 at the cell surface of melanoma cells suggesting that targeting TSPAN4 may offer a new therapeutic strategy to enhance immune checkpoint blockade in melanoma and other cancers."

Abstract:
This retrospective study evaluated patient-specific subperiosteal implants (IPS) for dental rehabilitation in severely atrophic maxillae. Eight patients with Cawood and Howell class VI atrophy were treated between 2021 and 2025. Rehabilitation was planned with prosthodontists and bioengineers using virtual surgical planning, CAD/CAM technology, and selective laser melting to create custom titanium implants. All implants were placed successfully without major complications. Follow-up ranged from 2 to 20 months (mean: 8.6 y). No infections, implant mobility, or inflammation were observed. Four patients completed final restorations, while 4 remain in progress. One patient experienced minor gingival retraction, and several reported transient maxillary hypoesthesia, which resolved or improved within 5 weeks. IPS implants appear to provide a reliable, graft-free solution for maxillary atrophy. Larger studies are needed to confirm long-term success and refine patient selection."

Abstract:
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate and compare the expression levels of Receptor Activator of Nuclear Factor Kappa B Ligand (RANKL) and Osteoprotegerin (OPG) in canine periodontal tissues subjected to periodontal distraction versus conventional retraction at different treatment time points.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study involved 40 cuspids from 20 patients (9 males, 11 females) randomly allocated to either the periodontal distraction (PD) group or the conventional retraction group. Appliances were applied by a single practitioner in a split-mouth design. In Group 1 (PD), a trans-palatal arch and Hyrax expanders were used following premolar extraction with osteotomies performed to facilitate distraction. Group 2 (conventional retraction) used MBT brackets with sectional archwires and elastic chains. Gingival crevicular fluid samples were collected on the first day (D0), after 1 week (W1), and 6 weeks (W6) and OPG and RANKL levels were analyzed using ELISA test.
RESULTS: There was a significant difference in canine retraction duration between methods (P < 0.001), with periodontal distraction taking 24.1 ± 2.08 days versus 110.5 ± 4.84 days for conventional retraction. RANKL levels showed no baseline difference, but were significantly higher in the periodontal distraction group at weeks 1 and 6 (P = 0.010 and P = 0.001, respectively). OPG levels were initially similar, but by weeks 1 and 6, they were significantly lower in the periodontal distraction group (P = 0.001).
CONCLUSION: The periodontal distraction method significantly reduces the duration of canine retraction and enhances osteoclastic activity, as evidenced by increased RANKL and decreased OPG levels, facilitating accelerated tooth movement through efficient bone resorption and remodeling."

Abstract:
OBJECTIVE: This study aims to demonstrate the correlation between anterior tooth retraction and changes in the dimensions of the pharyngeal airway in cases of bimaxillary protrusion.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Changes in dental parameters and the width of the upper and lower pharyngeal airways from 46 lateral cephalometric radiographs that met the inclusion criteria were measured. Changes were tested for significance using the paired t-test, and correlations were tested using the Pearson correlation test.
RESULTS: Significant changes were observed in dental parameters and in the width of the upper pharyngeal airway following orthodontic treatment (P < 0.05). However, no significant change was found in the width of the lower pharyngeal airway (P = 0.166). There was no significant correlation between changes in the upper incisor parameters and upper pharyngeal airway width (P = 0.130 and P = 0.738), nor between changes in the lower incisor parameters and lower pharyngeal airway width (P = 0.911 and P = 0.614).
CONCLUSION: Anterior tooth retraction does not significantly correlate with changes in the width of the pharyngeal airway. Therefore, premolar extraction for anterior tooth retraction can be considered a safe orthodontic approach in cases of bimaxillary protrusion."

Abstract:
BACKGROUND: Clear aligner therapy has become a preferred alternative to traditional fixed orthodontics due to its aesthetics and comfort. However, the slower rate of tooth movement remains a limitation. Incorporating built-in vibration technology within aligners is a recent innovation proposed to accelerate tooth movement by enhancing cellular activity and bone remodeling.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A prospective comparative study was conducted involving 40 orthodontic patients aged 18-30 years requiring anterior teeth retraction. Patients were randomly assigned into two groups: Group A (n = 20) received conventional clear aligners, and Group B (n = 20) received aligners with built-in vibration features (frequency 30 Hz, 5 minutes/day usage). All participants underwent standardized treatment planning, and tooth movement was evaluated using digital models at baseline, 4, 8, and 12 weeks.
RESULTS: The mean rate of tooth movement over 12 weeks was significantly higher in Group B (0.45 ± 0.08 mm/week) compared to Group A (0.29 ± 0.06 mm/week), with a P < 0.01. Group B also exhibited reduced overall treatment time by approximately 23%. No significant adverse effects or discomfort were reported in either group.
CONCLUSION: Aligners integrated with vibration features demonstrated a statistically significant increase in the rate of tooth movement compared to conventional aligners."

Abstract:
OBJECTIVE: The study used finite element analysis (FEA) to assess and quantify anchorage loss during simultaneous retraction and intrusion with or without anterior mini-implants under different forces.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: CBCT scans of a skeletal Class I patient were used. Mimics Research 18.0 was used to construct a maxilla 3D model from scans. FEA was done with ANSYS 2024 R2 employing a model with bilateral mini-screws and a control model without mini-screws. Each model received a 100g retraction force and additionally vertical intrusive forces 90 g, 120 g, and 150 g in model 2. Both models were limited to the superior maxilla and had appliance component glued connections.
RESULTS: FEA indicated that simultaneous intrusion and retraction enhanced maxillary first molar anterior displacement. The least displacement (6.24E-06 mm) occurred in model without mini-implants, while maximum displacement (6.86E-06 mm) in model with bilateral mini-implants with highest intrusive force.
CONCLUSION: This study showed that conventional retraction without intrusive forces minimizes anchorage loss. With increasing force magnitude of intrusion, anterior molar displacement also increases."

Abstract:
BACKGROUND: The movement of teeth in orthodontics is controlled by the body and involves changes to the surrounding bone. Since vitamin D helps maintain healthy calcium and bones, it could affect how fast and well tooth movement happens during orthodontics.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: During the study, 30 participants (age 18-25 years) had canine retraction after having their premolars extracted. Fifteen people in Group A were each given 600,000 IU Vitamin D3 injections once monthly for 3 months. At the same time, 15 people in Group B received injections of a placebo. Applying a standardized spring force of 150 g, we measured the rate of canine movement in study models at weeks 0, 4, 8, and 12. At both baseline and after treatment, serum levels of Vitamin D in blood samples were checked.
RESULTS: At each interval, Group A showed greater tooth movement than Group B which was statistically significant (mean movement at 12 weeks: 2.85 ± 0.32 mm in Group A vs. 1.97 ± 0.28 mm in Group B; P < 0.001). The serum 25(OH) D in Group A increased from baseline to 52.4 ± 6.7 ng/mL following the intervention. All participants were without any negative symptoms during the study.
CONCLUSION: Getting vitamin D supplements helps tooth movement in the orthodontics clinic, with no side effects, most likely because it improves the bone around the teeth."

Abstract:
OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effect of the rate of canine retraction by micro-osteoperforation and photobiostimulation in bimaxillary protrusion cases.
METHODS: Eighty maxillary canines were selected as per inclusion criteria and further equally divided into 20 maxillary canines into four groups; in Group 1, Micro-osteoperforation was performed distal to the maxillary canine and was repeated every three weeks for three months. Group 2: Low-level laser therapy (2 W, 810 nm, 4.77 J/cm2) was given for 10 seconds at the same interval as Group 1. Group 3: On the one side Group 1 therapy whereas on the other side Group 2 therapy was delivered. Group 4: It is the combination of both Groups 1 and 2 on the same side and the other side as control. The canine retraction was achieved using a Ni-Ti closed coil spring providing 150 g of force from the canine to the TADs, on a 0.019″ × 0.025″ stainless steel arch wire. The rate of canine retraction was measured.
RESULTS: The micro-osteoperforation (MOPs) and low-level laser therapy (LLLT) combined with Group 4 showed a significantly increased rate of tooth movement by 3.02-fold (P = 0.001). There was no significant difference in anchorage loss between MOP and LLLT.
CONCLUSION: The synergistic effect observed with the combined use of MOP and LLLT underscores the value of integrating acceleration techniques for optimal outcomes. The level of satisfaction and degree of easiness of the procedure were high in LLLT."

Abstract:
BACKGROUND: Revision total hip arthroplasty (THA) for isolated polyethylene exchange or acetabular revision with retention of the femoral component can present a challenge for adequate exposure. A systematic approach to a proper release can facilitate exposure and reduce the risk of iatrogenic complications.
DESCRIPTION: The posterior approach is an extensile and versatile approach for revision THA. After incising the fascia and iliotibial band, the insertion of the gluteus maximus is fully released. After releasing any scar along the inferior gluteus medius, a retractor is placed to hold the muscle belly cranially. The leg is gently internally rotated to place the posterior capsule and external rotators under tension while these structures are released from the posterior femur and along the neck of the femoral component. Curved scissors can be utilized to identify the psoas sheath and to release the inferior capsule while protecting the iliopsoas tendon. Scar tissue is resected from inside the hip joint, and a pocket is made in the anterior capsule to allow retractor placement above the equator of the acetabulum in order to hold the mobilized proximal femur anteriorly. An inferior retractor is then placed under the transverse acetabular ligament. This systematic approach allows adequate visualization of the acetabular component for revision.
ALTERNATIVES: Nonoperative treatment should be attempted first, depending on the diagnosis and its associated natural history. Once nonoperative treatment has been exhausted and revision THA is indicated, the anterior and direct lateral approaches can be considered. If the femoral component needs revision on the basis of intraoperative assessment, the anterior approach presents substantial difficulty in femoral exposure, with a higher risk of iatrogenic fracture. The direct lateral approach commonly leads to abductor weakness and a Trendelenburg gait.
RATIONALE: Common indications for revision THA with femoral component retention include wear and/or osteolysis, adverse local tissue reaction, recurrent instability, and aseptic acetabular loosening. Adequate exposure is essential to facilitate revision THA with femoral component retention and to minimize the risk of iatrogenic injury.
EXPECTED OUTCOMES: Survivorship free from re-revision at 2 years is >80% for both isolated polyethylene exchange and acetabular revision. There is a trend toward higher failure rates when retaining the acetabular component. Risk factors for failure include damage to the locking mechanism; femoral head erosion into the cup, damaging the metal; and a mispositioned acetabular component."

Abstract:
BACKGROUND: Various approaches have been described for hip arthroplasty1-3. The posterior approach to the hip remains a popular choice for hemiarthroplasty1. In the classic description, it involves detachment of the short external rotators, which include the quadriceps coxae (QC) (i.e., piriformis, superior gemellus, obturator internus, and inferior gemellus) along with the obturator externus and quadratus femoris (as needed). Since the QC are important for joint stability, detachment during the approach is associated with higher rates of postoperative dislocations4, even following subsequent surgical repair of the QC. In the study by Stähelin et al.5, 15 of 20 repairs involving the QC had failed by 3 months postoperatively, primarily because the repair site could not withstand the forces of normal weight-bearing during the healing phase. Various muscle-sparing modifications of the conventional approach have been described to reduce the propensity for prosthetic dislocation6-9. Hanly et al.9 described the SPAIRE (Sparing Piriformis and Internus, Repair Externus) technique. This minimally invasive modified posterior approach enables the preservation of the QC, possibly representing the greatest extent of muscle and tendon preservation. The advantages of this QC-sparing technique have been demonstrated in clinical studies of hemiarthroplasty10,11 and total hip arthroplasty12.
DESCRIPTION: The patient is anesthetized and placed in a lateral decubitus position. Bolsters are utilized over the pubis and sacral areas to provide stable pelvic orientation. The contralateral limb is flexed at the hip (∼45°) and knee (90°), with adequate padding under the fibular head and lateral malleolus. Another padded bolster is placed between the legs to keep the topmost lower limb in neutral to slight abduction at the hip. The operative limb is flexed at the hip (∼30°), and a 10 to 15-cm straight skin incision is marked on the lateral aspect of hip, centered on the posterolateral tip of the greater trochanter. The deep fascia is opened distally to proximally, incised distally with scissors, and separated proximally with finger dissection. This step creates an intermuscular plane between the gluteus maximus posteriorly and tensor fasciae latae anteriorly. A Charnley hip retractor is applied. Internal rotation of the hip allows identification of the posterior border of the gluteus medius and short external rotators. The fat pad over the QC is swept medially with an abdominal sponge to identify the muscles. A plane is identified between the quadratus femoris and inferior gemellus."

Abstract:
Microglia, the resident immune cells in the central nervous system, play important roles not only in immune response but also in neurogenesis, synaptogenesis, and neural circuit formation. Microglia also surveil the brain environment via elongation and retraction of their processes. Previously, we found that the purine salvage pathway is involved in the regulation of morphology and dynamics of the microglial cell line BV2. Here, we show that intraperitoneal administration of mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), an inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH) inhibitor, reduces microglial branching during postnatal development. Imaging mass spectrometry analysis revealed that MMF administration decreases guanosine nucleotides in the brain. Interestingly, despite the essential role of guanosine nucleotides in cellular proliferation, MMF administration did not significantly affect microglial proliferation. On the other hand, MMF administration attenuated the level of GTP-bound forms of RhoA and Rac1 small GTPases. Notably, MMF administration decreased the number of branches, while process length remained unaffected. Since microglial branching affects microglial complexity and diversity, our findings suggest that guanosine nucleotide production is essential for generating proper microglial diversity."

Abstract:
BACKGROUND: Parasympathetic tone activity (PTA) and its association with behavior in conscious versus anesthesia in horses are unknown.
OBJETIVES: To study PTA, heart rate (HR), minimum alveolar concentration (MAC), and mean arterial pressure (MAP) during castration under anesthesia. To study PTA, HR, Horse Grimace Scale (HGS), locomotor activity (LA), and behavior in conscious horses before and after castration.
METHODS: Pilot study including seven healthy adult horses. After habituation (days 1, 2, and 3), PTAm, HR, HGS, LA, and behavior were investigated during pre-surgery (days 4-, 5-, and one-hour pre-anesthesia), and post-surgery (6 h post-surgery and days 7 and 8) periods. PTAm, HR, MAP, and MAC were recorded during castration.
RESULTS: PTAm increased significantly during anesthesia (P < 0.001), with sequential increase as time passed (P < 0.001): 15 min = 27.4% (62.6, CI 57.3-67.8), 20 min = 38.2% (70, CI 55.7-84.3), 25 min = 59.6% (87.9, CI 76.3-99.4), 30 min = 55.6% (84.1, CI 76.8-91.5). MAP increased significantly after emasculation (P < 0.003) at 1 min (91 mmHg, CI 77.3-104.7) and 5 min (81 mmHg, CI 67.3-94.7). An increase HGS (P < 0.05), PTAm (Δ16%, P < 0.001), head up latency (P = 0.042), and frequency of limb retraction (P = 0.042), while a decrease in LA (P = 0.004), appetite (P = 0.043), and water consumption (P < 0.05) in days post-surgery were observed.
CONCLUSION: Modulation of vagal tone occurs in response to castration under anesthesia and preservation of homeostasis days post-surgery."

Abstract:
High body mass index (BMI) patients undergoing autologous breast reconstruction with the deep inferior epigastric perforator (DIEP) flap face the increased risk of wound healing complications, fat necrosis, and donor-site morbidity. While postoperative outcomes are well documented, the intraoperative technical challenges of flap harvest in this population are underreported. The heavy abdominal pannus complicates exposure, often necessitating experienced assistance and prolonging operative times. We describe a reproducible, single-operator DIEP flap harvest technique designed to overcome these challenges. The method involves limited incision and dissection to island only the required flap dimensions, sequential exposure down to fascia, and use of a suspension suture to secure the superior abdominal skin. Directional gravity and simple retraction thereby replace continuous assistant involvement. The superficial inferior epigastric vein (SIEV) is identified through a focussed longitudinal incision, eliminating the need for wide inferior pannus retraction. This approach minimises operator strain, reduces dependence on experienced assistance and provides controlled access to the flap perforators, as well as a long length of SIEV. In our experience, this technique has streamlined flap harvest, reduced surgeon energy expenditure, and shortened overall operative times in a technically demanding patient subgroup. By simplifying pannus management and optimising exposure, the technique enhances the safety, efficiency, and reproducibility of DIEP flap elevation in high-BMI patients. Adoption of this approach may broaden access to safe, autologous reconstruction for high-BMI patients and contribute to improved outcomes in this growing and often underserved population. LAY SUMMARY: A new surgical approach makes breast reconstruction using tummy tissue safe and easier for patients with higher BMI. It improves visibility during surgery, reduces operating time and effort, and may help more patients access successful natural-tissue reconstructions."

Abstract:
OBJECTIVE: Aim: To develop a scientifically grounded approach to defining the basis and limits of criminalizing fraud and misconduct in clinical trials of medicinal products, while also raising awareness and encouraging serious discussion of these issues.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Materials and Methods: The study relies on the Acquis Communautaire and the legislation of Ukraine, Germany, and Poland. It also uses judicial practices from the United States, France, and Ukraine, as well as legal statistics and draft legislation from Ukraine. Scientific research methods such as induction, deduction, comparison, analysis, case studies, and systems analysis were employed.
CONCLUSION: Conclusions: Criminal penalties for unlawful actions during clinical trials of medicinal products, guided by the ultima ratio principle, should be applied only to violations that threaten the lives or health of research subjects, infringe upon their rights, or involve falsification of clinical trial results regarding the efficacy and safety of the products, rather than to any violations alone."

Abstract:
OBJECTIVES: Swallowing biomechanics in primates and other mammals is poorly understood, and the effect of hyoid descent on swallowing biomechanics lacks experimental interrogation. In macaques, which share similar swallowing kinematics with humans, the base of the tongue and the food bolus are hypothesized to be driven into the oropharynx by a hydraulic mechanism, at the core of which is elevation and protraction of the hyoid. Here, the musculoskeletal mechanisms driving these hyoid movements are experimentally evaluated in macaque primates.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We integrate XROMM-based measures of mandibular, cranial, and hyolingual kinematics with electromyography of suprahyoid and lingual muscles to evaluate the underlying kinetics of swallowing.
RESULTS: All suprahyoid muscles rotate during swallowing and tongue base retraction. Hyoid elevation and protraction are powered by concentric activation and rotation of posterior mylohyoid and both digastric muscle bellies, followed by concentric activation of geniohyoid muscle. Genioglossus is predominantly active early in swallowing.
DISCUSSION: Morphology, function, and coordination of suprahyoid and lingual muscles are especially important determinants of swallowing performance in macaques, and probably humans. Here, we characterize suprahyoid muscle biomechanics within a dynamic framework of architectural gear ratios and pulley systems that optimize hyoid elevation velocity to quickly ""prime the pump"" and subsequent hyoid protraction power and/or force to drive the hydraulic mechanism of tongue base retraction. Because of muscle rotation, primate hyolingual muscle function is particularly dependent on hyoid posture and muscle geometry, which may have important implications for the evolution of swallowing biomechanics in human evolution."

Abstract:
Next Generation Sequencing is a constantly evolving technology whose applicability is increasingly expanding into the field of routine food analysis. In this context, metabarcoding has proven to be a powerful tool for detecting food fraud due to its ability to taxonomically classify even highly fragmented DNA from processed products. While Illumina sequencing platforms, representing second-generation sequencing technologies, are widely used for such applications, fourth-generation sequencing devices such as Oxford Nanopore Technologies' MinION offer advantages in terms of flexibility, scalability, and simplified handling. In this study, we evaluate the transferability of an established Illumina-based metabarcoding method for the detection of pistachio adulteration in processed foods to the MinION platform of Oxford Nanopore Technology. In more detail, we transferred the established method from Illumina on both MinION and Flongle flow cells to assess sequencing accuracy, quantification potential and practical aspects such as cost-efficiency and workflow. Our results highlight the applicability of the MinION sequencing platform as a reliable and cost-effective alternative to Illumina protocols for routine food authenticity testing, enabling faster processing and broader accessibility without significantly compromising accuracy."

Abstract:
Honey variety authentication is critical for ensuring market integrity and protecting consumer rights, especially for high-value unifloral honeys, such as acacia honey, which are frequently adulterated with low-value alternatives such as rape honey due to their similar visual appearance. The aim of this study was to develop a method for precise discrimination between rape honey and acacia honey using their chemical profiles combined with machine learning. A total of 542 honey samples were collected from major beekeeping regions in China. Targeted quantification of 12 sugars and 20 amino acids was performed using UPLC-MS/MS. Multivariate analysis revealed significant differences in sugar and amino acid compositions between the two honey types, though partial samples overlapped due to chemical similarity. Six machine learning algorithms, including the Multilayer Perceptron, were employed for classification. Optimization was performed via 10-fold cross-validation and ADASYN oversampling, yielding optimal performance of 98% and 100% prediction accuracies for rape honey and acacia honey, respectively, on the independent test set. SHAP (Shapley Additive Explanations) analysis identified key differential markers, including fructose, turanose, glucose, and GABA, which contributed most to the classification. Furthermore, a user-friendly web application was developed to facilitate rapid on-site authentication. This study provides an innovative technical framework for honey variety discrimination, with potential applications in quality control and anti-fraud practices."

Abstract:
Food fraud, particularly in the olive oil sector, represents a pressing concern within the agri-food industry, with implications for consumer trust and product authenticity. Certified products like Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) Extra Virgin Olive Oil (EVOO) are premium products that undergo strict quality controls, must comply with specific production regulations, and generally have a higher market price. These characteristics make them particularly vulnerable to economically motivated adulteration. In this study, the adulteration of PDO EVOO with Olive Pomace Oil (POO) and Olive Oil (OO) was investigated through a combined analytical approach. A traditional technique, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) combined with solid-phase microextraction (SPME), was employed alongside an innovative method based on an electronic nose equipped with metal oxide semiconductor (MOX) sensors. GC-MS analysis enabled the identification of characteristic volatile compounds, providing a detailed chemical fingerprint of the different oil samples. Concurrently, the MOX sensor array successfully detected variations in the volatile profiles released by the adulterated oils, demonstrating its potential as a rapid and cost-effective screening tool. The complementary use of both techniques highlighted the reliability of MOX sensors in differentiating authentic PDO EVOO from adulterated samples and underscored their applicability in routine quality control and fraud prevention strategies."

Abstract:
Wine, as a high-value product, is vulnerable to counterfeiting. To tackle increasingly sophisticated fraud, innovative analytical approaches are required. However, they must undergo rigorous validation. Proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-NMR) is intrinsically quantitative, reproducible, and fast, making it a promising tool for official control. This study presents the development and validation of a standardised and fully automated workflow for the quantification of 20 oenologically relevant compounds, including organic acids, sugars, alcohols, esters, phenolics, and an alkaloid. The method combines optimised sample preparation, external quantification standards, spectrometer calibration, and a dedicated R package (RnmrQuant1D) for fully automated spectral processing, enabling high-throughput and operator-independent analysis. Validation was performed under intermediate precision according to OIV metrological standards, evaluating accuracy, precision, robustness, limits of quantification, and measurement uncertainty. The results demonstrated excellent linearity, trueness, and reproducibility, matching the targeted analytical performance. Measurement uncertainties were estimated both by conventional linear modelling and by a dynamic approach better suited to detection limits. The workflow is easy to implement, requires minimal sample consumption, and substantially reduces operator bias. Beyond validating a robust method, this study provides a framework for harmonised, transferable 1H-NMR workflows that could support large-scale databases, integration with chemometric models, and ultimately, 1H-NMR's recognition as a relevant method for wine authentication and quality control. This work fills a crucial gap in wine analysis by uniting practical application and rigorous methods, enabling broader adoption in control laboratories worldwide."

Abstract:
The Chinese plum (Prunus salicina L.), 'Zuili', is a geographically protected cultivar that is valued for its high polyphenol levels and distinctive flavor. Light availability strongly influences sugar accumulation and secondary metabolism in plum fruit, yet the molecular processes associated with quality variation under protected cultivation remain unclear. Here, we compare three cultivation systems-multi-span greenhouse (M), retractable electric rain shelter (R), and conventional open field (CK)-to evaluate their effect on fruit quality using integrated transcriptomic and metabolomic analyses. Field trials showed that M treatment increased fruit sweetness by 28.10% versus CK (14.68 vs. 11.46 °Brix, p < 0.001) without yield loss and significantly improved vertical fruit diameter. RNA-seq analysis identified 7561 and 7962 upregulated genes in the M and R treatments compared to CK, respectively, with significant functional enrichment in pathways related to sucrose metabolism, light-response, and ethylene-mediated signaling. Untargeted metabolomic signaling identified 1373 metabolites, with shading treatments increasing the abundance of several sugar-conjugated compounds (e.g., epicatechin 3-O-(2-trans-cinnamoyl)-β-D-allopyranoside). Multi-omics integration revealed coordinated changes in gene expression and metabolite abundance, suggesting that controlled light environments are associated with the concurrent modulation of sugar metabolism and phenylpropanoid-related pathways. These patterns were supported by the upregulation of GT2-family glycosyltransferase genes and the accumulation of lignin-related flavonoid precursors, such as pinobanksin and pinobanksinol. Collectively, these results highlight statistically robust associations between light-regulated cultivation practices and fruit quality traits, providing a molecular framework for optimizing protected cultivation strategies to enhance both the sensory and nutritional attributes of P. salicina fruit without compromising yield."

Abstract:
China, as the primary importer of Thailand's high-quality rice (Oryza sativa L.), has an urgent need for effective origin discrimination methods between premium aromatic rice from China and Thailand to prevent origin mislabeling issues. In this study, stable isotope and elemental multivariate analysis combined with partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) were used to build an origin traceability model for Chinese and Thai rice from different production areas. Multivariate analysis of variance revealed that Thai rice exhibited significantly higher δ13C (-26.4 ± 0.4‱) and δ18O (25.9 ± 1.1‱) values, but a significantly lower δ15N value (3.5 ± 0.8‱) compared to the three major producing regions of China. These differences are directly related to geographical and climatic factors such as latitude, precipitation, and temperature. A PLS-DA model demonstrated high performance in the classification of different Chinese indica rice and Thailand rice origins. Through cross-validation, the classification accuracy for the training set reached 97.3%. For the independent testing set, the classification accuracy was recorded to be 95.0%. Furthermore, external blind sample verification was conducted, and the classification accuracy achieved was 100%. Ca, K, Na, δ18O, Zn and δ2H were found to be important variables to discriminate between Chinese indica rice and Thai rice. Finally, for country of origin labelling claims, this rice study provides the basis for a suitable regulatory method to detect mislabeled Thai origin rice and prevent fraud."

Abstract:
BACKGROUND: Objective performance indicators (OPIs) include measures of instrument movement during robotic procedures and can assess movement smoothness. This study analyzes smoothness metrics in cholecystectomy, hypothesizing that longer, more complex tasks exhibit reduced movement smoothness.
METHODS: Cholecystectomy videos from our institution were analyzed, with Parkland grading used to assess cholecystitis severity. Since longer duration likely indicates greater complexity, cases were categorized as either complex or standard based on when the duration of a key operative step exceeded the surgeon's mean by at least one standard deviation - complex dissection (CD) vs standard dissection (SD). OPIs were evaluated for Calot triangle dissection (CTD) and liver bed dissection (LBD). Smoothness-related OPIs-including movement arrest period ratio (MAPR), spectral arc length (spalength), normalized speed (normspeed), speed peaks rate (SPR), and nondimensional jerk (nlognJerk)-were further classified based on arm function (e.g., dominant arm (DA) vs. active retraction (AR)).
RESULTS: Fifty-four videos were evaluated. Average step duration for CTD and LBD were 14.18 ± 9.87 and 10.05 ± 7.72 min, respectively. Case duration was correlated with Parkland grade (r = 0.26, p = 0.03). Parkland grade for CD was significantly higher than SD in CTD (2.7 vs 2.0, p < 0.03) but not in LBD. In both CTD and LBD, the smoothness profile for DA was affected differently than AR in CD. DA during CTD showed significant reductions in MAPR (0.78 vs 0.92), normspeed (0.24 vs 0.35), SPR (40.22 vs 65.63), nlognjerk (-37.96 vs -36.48) and spalength (-70,604.4 vs -35,742.5). However, significant changes were only seen for AR during CTD in SPR (11.73 vs 18.37), nlognjerk (-36.94 vs -35.23) and spalength (-119,126.5 vs -64,669.5) (all p < 0.05). Similar patterns were seen during LBD.
CONCLUSIONS: Smoothness metrics seem to be affected by case difficulty and may be a marker for struggling and potentially used to determine when a surgeon needs help or guide case review."

Abstract:
BACKGROUND: Lateral lumbar interbody fusion is a widely used technique to address degenerative lumbar conditions but can be associated with injury to the psoas, lumbar plexus, and abdominal wall owing to retractor usage. We describe a minimally invasive endoscopic lateral lumbar interbody fusion (ELLIF) procedure that aims to reduce these complications by avoiding prolonged muscle retraction, preparing the disc space under direct endoscopic vision, and shortening the surgical time.
METHODS: Between 2019 and 2024, 35 patients underwent ELLIF at a single center. Discectomy, endplate preparation, and iliac crest harvest were done via a working-channel endoscope without expandable retractors. Neurophysiological monitoring was used to minimize nerve injury. Outcomes included complications, visual analog scale scores for pain, and Oswestry Disability Index (ODI).
RESULTS: Of the 35 patients (mean age 60 years), 26 had preoperative radicular pain and 9 had neurological deficits. Six minor complications occurred in 4 patients (11.4%), all managed conservatively without permanent deficits. No patients developed new radiculopathy or paresis, and there were no infections or reoperations. ODI improved by 57% at 1 month and by 88% at 1 year (both P < 0.001). By the 3-year follow-up in 9 patients, ODI scores remained near normal, and visual analog scale was reduced by 93% from baseline.
CLINICAL RELEVANCE: We present a minimally invasive, ELLIF, and decompression technique that provides patients with minimal complications and excellent functional recovery.
CONCLUSION: ELLIF offers a safe, minimally invasive alternative for patients with lumbar degenerative disease. This technique minimizes direct retraction on the psoas and lumbar plexus, resulting in a low complication rate and substantial functional recovery at short- and medium-term follow-up."

Abstract:
BACKGROUND: Thoracic disc herniations (TDHs) are rare, comprising <1% of all disc herniations, but when symptomatic can cause severe neurological dysfunction. Traditional open and mini-open approaches allow for ventral canal decompression but are associated with high morbidity, including pulmonary complications, chest tube placement, and frequent need for fusion. Full-endoscopic thoracic discectomy has emerged as an ultra-minimally invasive alternative with reduced complications and faster recovery, but its application to midline or calcified thoracic discs remains technically demanding.
CASE PRESENTATION: We report the case of a 54-year-old man with progressive chest wall pain and lower-extremity hyperreflexia who was found to have a T6 to T7 central disc herniation with mild calcification and spinal cord signal change. The patient underwent an outpatient right-sided full-endoscopic transforaminal discectomy. Complete decompression was achieved without spinal cord retraction or manipulation. The patient had complete resolution of his preoperative pain and was discharged home within 2 hours.
DISCUSSION: Compared with open thoracic discectomy, endoscopic approaches significantly lower complication rates, blood loss, hospital stay, and cost while preserving motion segments. Our case highlights strategies for addressing technically challenging central TDHs, including lateralized access, controlled bony resection, and angled instrumentation. These methods align with growing evidence demonstrating the safety and efficacy of endoscopy in thoracic pathology, though the technique requires advanced endoscopic expertise and careful patient selection.
CONCLUSION: Full-endoscopic transforaminal discectomy provides a safe, effective, and minimally invasive option for central TDHs in selected cases. With proper planning and advanced technical execution, endoscopic surgery can achieve decompression comparable to open surgery while minimizing morbidity and expediting recovery."

Abstract:
INTRODUCTION: Parastomal hernias are a common and complex problem for patients and their surgeons. Despite multiple established repair strategies, recurrence rates remain high. We present a novel open retromuscular repair technique using a 3D funnel mesh.
METHODS: The technique involves retrorectus dissection, transversus abdominis release (TAR), lateralisation of the stomal conduit, and retromuscular placement of a 3D funnel mesh. A second flat mesh reinforces the remaining retromuscular space. Abdominoplasty was performed where excess skin or fat contributed to the parastomal ‘bulge’.
RESULTS: Fifteen patients underwent repair (median age 59 years, BMI 33.8 kg/m²). Nine had a colostomy and six an ileostomy. Five (33%) had a recurrent parastomal hernia, and 13 (87%) had concomitant incisional hernia. The median combined transverse defect width was 11.9 cm (IQR 10.4–12.2). Abdominoplasty was performed in 13 patients (87%). At median 15-month follow-up, no recurrences, stenoses, or obstructions were observed. Complications included wound infection (n = 2), seroma (n = 1), abscess (n = 1), stoma prolapse (n = 1), and stoma retraction (n = 1). Two patients required stoma refashioning.
CONCLUSION: The retromuscular 3D funnel mesh technique offers a robust repair with potential advantages over other recognized repair options. It also addresses the peristomal ‘bulge’ of redundant skin and excess subcutaneous fat that can compromise stoma appliance application and adherence. Comparative studies focused on patient reported outcome measures are needed to determine if this technique confers advantages over other established procedures."

Abstract:
BACKGROUND: Shear wave elastography (SWE) is a relatively recent ultrasound imaging technique that uses focused acoustic radiation forces to quantify the elasticity of biological tissues, commonly referred to as 'elastographic stiffness'. Preliminary data suggest that the elastographic stiffness of a torn supraspinatus tendon may serve as an independent predictor of retear risk following surgical repair. However, the feasibility of obtaining accurate preoperative SWE measurements remains uncertain, as tendon retraction beneath the acromion can limit visualization and reliable assessment.
METHODS: This was a prospective cohort study that recruited 60 consecutive patients who had received a diagnosis of supraspinatus tear. SWE imaging was conducted to determine the elastographic stiffness of each patient's torn supraspinatus tendon.
RESULTS: SWE values of the edge of the torn supraspinatus were successfully measured in 59/60 (98%) of cases, resulting in a failure to measure rate of 2%. SWE measurements were not feasible in a single case where the anteroposterior or mediolateral tear lengths were greater than 28 mm. Tendon elastographic stiffness, measured as elasticity (kPa), was inversely correlated with anteroposterior tear length (R2 -.51, P < .001), mediolateral tear length (R2 -.54, P < .001), and patient age (R2 -.27, P < .05).
CONCLUSION: This study shows that preoperative SWE of the torn supraspinatus tendon is a feasible imaging methodology if the supraspinatus tear is < 30 mm. Patients who had smaller tears and who were younger had greater SWE than older patients with larger tears."

Abstract:
Anterior cervical spine surgery is widely performed to manage degenerative, traumatic, and compressive spinal conditions. Despite its effectiveness, iatrogenic nerve injuries remain a significant concern due to the complex anatomy of the cervical region. This review offers a focused narrative on nerve injuries associated with anterior cervical approaches, including recurrent and superior laryngeal nerve palsy, C5 nerve root palsy, and hypoglossal nerve injury. Less common complications such as Parsonage-Turner syndrome (PTS), C8-T1 radiculopathy, and Horner's syndrome are also addressed. Each injury is discussed in terms of anatomical relevance, incidence, clinical features, diagnosis, and strategies for prevention and management. A structured review of PubMed-indexed literature from the past 25 years was conducted to ensure the inclusion of current evidence. Risk factors such as multilevel surgery, revision procedures, and excessive retraction are highlighted. While many nerve injuries are self-limited, a subset may result in long-term deficits, reinforcing the need for meticulous surgical planning and intraoperative care. By increasing awareness of these complications, this review aims to inform surgical technique and reduce morbidity in anterior cervical spine surgery. This review emphasizes not only the incidence and anatomical relevance of these complications, but also underscores the importance of preventive measures such as careful retraction, intraoperative neuromonitoring, and preoperative planning. By synthesizing data across multiple studies and including rare complications such as Horner's syndrome and PTS, this review provides a practical reference for surgeons aiming to reduce morbidity. Ultimately, the goal is to improve surgical safety and patient quality of life through heightened awareness and refinement of technique."

Abstract:
Following the publication of the above paper, it was drawn to the Editor's attention by a concerned reader that certain of the immunofluorescence data shown in Fig. 1F, cell viability assay data in Fig. 2F, the 'Control' data for the tissue images relating to apoptotic experiments in Fig. 5B and the 'CHOP/TIPE‑2' histological data in Fig. 5E were strikingly similar to data in articles written by different authors at different research institutes that had either already been published previously in other journals, or which were submitted for publication at around the same time (in the interim, one of those articles has been retracted). In addition, western blot data featured in Fig. 2 were rather similar to data appearing in Fig. 3, suggesting that the same data may have been included in these figures to show the results from purportedly differently performed experiments. The Editorial Office were able to draw the same conclusions as the reader based upon an independent analysis of the contentious data in question. Therefore, owing to the fact that some of these data had already been published prior to its submission to Molecular Medicine Reports, the Editor has decided that this paper should be retracted from the Journal. The authors were asked for an explanation to account for these concerns, but the Editorial Office did not receive a reply. The Editor apologizes to the readership for any inconvenience caused.

Abstract:
BACKGROUND: Extensive retraction of mandibular incisors in Class III treatment may increase the risk of orthodontically induced apical root resorption (OIARR). This retrospective cohort study aimed to assess the incidence and severity of OIARR in Class III patients treated nonsurgically with lingual high precision fixed appliances (HPFAs) and significant anterior tooth retraction.
METHODS: Eligible for inclusion were adolescent and adult Class III patients treated with lingual HPFAs (WIN, DW Lingual Systems GmbH) and extraction of lower premolars, who completed treatment between 2015 and 2024. Pre- (T0) and post-treatment (T1) panoramic radiographs were measured for root and crown lengths, with relative root resorption (rRR, %) calculated for each tooth. Clinically relevant OIARR was assessed using the Malmgren index (scores 1-4). Statistical significance of mean rRR (%) changes was assessed using one-sample t-tests (α = 0.05).
RESULTS: A total of 25 patients (mean age at T1 26.8 ± 9.7 years; 12 females, 13 males; mean Wits at T0 -6.7 ± 2.5 mm) and 350 mandibular teeth were analyzed. The mean rRR for anterior teeth was 3.15 ± 4.05%, with no cases of severe resorption (Malmgren score 4) and only 6.7% of roots exhibiting clinically relevant shortening (Malmgren score 3). There was no increased risk of OIARR in anterior teeth compared to premolars and molars (3.15% vs. 3.31%).
CONCLUSION: Extensive bodily retraction of lower anterior teeth was not associated with significant OIARR in this Class III cohort. Excellent torque control using HPFAs enabled considerable retraction with low risk of OIARR, supporting this approach as a safe nonsurgical alternative for Class III camouflage."

Abstract:
To help counteract food fraud and meet consumer expectations, the pork industry requires reliable quality-monitoring and traceability systems. In this context, rapid evaporative ionisation mass spectrometry (REIMS) could be rolled out as a real-time, accurate metabolic fingerprint-based classifier of pork meat characteristics and quality issues, such as genetic origin and boar taint. Here, fingerprinting of >3000 pig neck fat samples enabled highly accurate pig breed classification (pairwise comparison of Commercials (Pietrain × Hampshires × Durocs, Large-Whites, Durocs), Hampshires and Large-Whites, where data modelling using support vector machine (SVM, all pairwise comparisons > 89%) and orthogonal partial least squares-discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA, >90%) outperformed random forest (RF, 72.0-79.5%). Boar taint classification showed comparable results between OPLS-DA, RF and SVM (93.5-96.0%), but it was important to apply strategies to avoid false negatives and positives, including the construction of balanced models (tainted vs. non-tainted)."

Abstract:
OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to explore the nature of retraction notices associated with complementary and alternative medicine focused journals.
METHOD: Data related to retractions in complementary and alternative medicine journals were extracted from the Retraction Watch Database for the period 2000-2025.
RESULTS: The analysis found that there were 902 notices associated with 42 complementary and alternative medicine journals. Overall, the percentage of retractions relative to all papers published in the named journals is low (<1%) however a single journal was responsible for 84% of retractions. The majority of these retractions occurred in 2023 as the result of a wider publisher investigation into paper mills and sham peer-review. Similar to other studies, retraction was rarely due to a single cause but reflected a mix of data integrity concerns, peer-review issues, evidence of plagiarism and other issues. The average time between original publication and retraction was 19 months (mode 10 months) with 98% of publications having multiple authors. The main country of origin of authors of retracted works were China, India and South Korea.
DISCUSSION: Published peer-reviewed literature is used in a range of ways, as the foundation for future studies, incorporated in systematic reviews, clinical decision-making and in training of practitioners and clinicians. While this study has demonstrated that retractions in the complementary and alternative medicine literature is generally at a lower level, any evidence of publication integrity breach is a concern and should be cause for ongoing monitoring."

Abstract:
Recently, many scientific studies have discussed multiverse models based on the string theory landscape. However, from the perspective of the philosophy of science, there has been a great debate on the falsifiability of the multiverse models. As there is no consensus among scientists and philosophers on the criteria of falsifiability, whether the string-based multiverse theory is a legitimate scientific theory or not is found to be inconclusive. In this article, I have used Lakatos's idea of a scientific research programme to evaluate the string-based multiverse theory developed over the past few decades. From the perspective of the history of science, I show that the string-based multiverse research programme is close to being a degenerating research programme, which means that this line of research did not generate any substantial growth of truth content."

To date, studies that have examined or validated the total number of Doctor of Nursing Practice graduates who have published their scholarly quality improvement or evidence-based practice improvement projects are limited. This article presents successful ways to organize and prepare a manuscript for submission to a nursing scientific journal. A discussion on editor decisions and ways to respond to reviewer comments and editor decisions is presented.

Abstract:
The plasma membrane exhibits diverse substructures, such as pseudopodia, membrane nanotubes, and migrasomes, that are essential for cellular communication and cargo transport. Imaging these fine structures remains challenging due to their nanoscale dimensions and limitations of existing fluorescent probes. Here, we report the development of two rhodamine-based probes, RSD1 and RSD2, incorporating anionic membrane-anchoring groups and pyrrolidine auxochromes to enable wash-free, serum-compatible, long-term plasma membrane imaging. RSD2, in particular, demonstrates superior fluorogenicity, brightness, and photoswitching properties, facilitating high-resolution imaging in both live and fixed cells. It selectively labels membrane substructures across diverse cell types and maintains membrane specificity in the presence of serum. RSD2 is compatible with advanced microscopy techniques including confocal microscopy, instant structured illumination microscopy (iSIM), and direct stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (dSTORM), achieving up to 40 nm resolution. Using two-color dSTORM, we visualize silica nanoparticle trafficking via membrane nanotubes and gondola-like bulges in neuronal cells, marking the first such observation. RSD2 also enables imaging of migrasomes and retraction fibers, revealing dynamic membrane-mediated transport processes. This probe offers a robust and versatile platform for investigating membrane architecture and function, with broad applicability in cell biology, nanomedicine, and super-resolution imaging."

Abstract:
INTRODUCTION: Traditional oropharyngeal resection may require lip-split mandibulotomy approach (LSMA) which risks high morbidity. Transoral robotic surgery (TORS) through the oral pharynx mitigates these risks. Free flap (FF) inset following resection is challenging and may require open approaches, negating the benefits of TORS resection. We present our case series utilizing the single port (SP) robot for FF inset, which has improved visualization and functionality compared with a multiport robot.
METHODS: A retrospective review of robotic FF inset following TORS using the SP from 2021 to 2022. Patient and tumor characteristics as well as operative and postoperative details were gathered.
RESULTS: Five cases were performed with an average age of 62.4 (50-78) years. Radial forearm FF was used in three cases and anterolateral thigh flap in two. Mean operative time was 528 (423-742) minutes with an average ischemia time of 156.6 (124-198) min. Average functional oral intake score was 5.8 (3-7) out of 7. There were no FF losses or wound healing issues at an average of 17.6 (7-27) months follow-up.
CONCLUSION: Robotic FF inset following TORS is feasible with the SP robot already used by ENTs for resection. The platform has 6 mm instruments capable of 7 degrees of freedom, use of a third arm for dynamic retraction, and the ability to assume a ""cobra-like"" position to leverage a tight space. This gives plastic surgeons an opportunity to decrease the complication profile from FF inset that would otherwise require potentially morbid exposures."

Abstract:
BACKGROUND: BCCT.core software has been validated for breast-conserving therapy. This study examined the use of the BCCT.core software as an objective tool to evaluate aesthetic outcomes following bilateral nipple-sparing mastectomy and implant-based breast reconstruction.
METHODS: A retrospective review of standardized anterior photographs from 123 patients who underwent bilateral nipple-sparing, implant-based breast reconstruction was performed. The BCCT.core software assigned an outcome class (excellent = 1, good = 2, fair = 3, and poor = 4). Seven symmetry and contour parameters were extracted: 4 linear measures (breast retraction assessment, lower breast contour, upward nipple retraction, and breast compliance evaluation), and 3 area-based measures (breast contour difference, breast area difference, and breast overlap difference).
RESULTS: All 7 objective parameters demonstrated statistically significant differences across the 4 BCCT.core classes (analysis of variance, P < 0.001 for each). Linear parameters showed narrower confidence intervals and a lower coefficient of variation, suggesting superior discriminatory power and reproducibility.
CONCLUSIONS: The linear parameters (breast retraction assessment, lower breast contour, upward nipple retraction, and breast compliance evaluation) demonstrated consistent correlations with the BCCT.core aesthetic outcome classes and superior reproducibility compared with area-based indices. These findings validate the BCCT.core software for reconstruction and support its clinical use in standardizing the benchmarking of reconstructive results."

Abstract:
In this case report, we present a 33-year-old male patient with a rare, chronic, isolated rupture of the sternal head of the pectoralis major (PM) at its sternal origin following a combat sport injury. Managing this case proved challenging due to the chronicity of the injury, which caused significant retraction and suboptimal tissue quality, and the scarcity of available literature regarding such cases. We employed a novel surgical technique using a polypropylene mesh-anchor-suture construct to reinsert the muscle to its sternal origin. Recovery was uneventful, with restoration of near full range of motion and strength by 6 months post-surgery. Our approach to this case demonstrates the feasibility of surgical repair of rare PM ruptures of sternal origin, even with delayed presentation, using modified surgical techniques."

Abstract:
BACKGROUND: As online data collection proliferates, healthcare researchers face challenges with fraudulent research participants. While substantial literature on preventing and detecting fraudulent responses in surveys is available, a dearth of nursing literature focuses on identifying and addressing fraudulent participation in online qualitative studies.
OBJECTIVES: The aims of this article are to highlight the researchers' experience with fraudulent research participants in an online qualitative study, enhance awareness of imposter participants, and propose strategies for identification of imposters' participation that threaten research validity.
METHODS: A qualitative, descriptive study was designed to explore nursing professional development (NPD) specialists' use of NPD practice judgment. Participants were recruited for online focus groups via email using a national association's email list. A $25 gift card was offered to participants. Suspected fraudulent participants led to the cancellation of focus groups and prompted a review of initial recruitment email responses. A framework for detecting fraudulent responses was developed based on this review.
RESULTS: Out of 2,368 volunteers, 28 were invited to participate in 4 focus groups. During the initial focus group, participants did not use their cameras despite the facilitator's request, and they failed to provide meaningful responses. These suspicious actions prompted the facilitator to end the focus group. Subsequently the researchers investigated the phenomenon of imposter participants in qualitative research and analyzed their respondent's applications for signs of fraud. Indications of fraudulent responses to the call for volunteers included an unexpectedly large number of applications received in rapid succession, Gmail addresses with similar naming conventions, and common IP addresses originating outside the United States.
DISCUSSION: Examination of recruitment survey responses, including volume, timing, and email structure, suggest potential ""bot"" use for volunteer survey completion. Qualitative researchers must implement measures to prevent fraudulent participants, enhance data scanning protocols to detect suspicious responses, and exclude fraudulent data to maintain research integrity."

Abstract:
BACKGROUND: Secondary facial defects remain a primary focus in plastic surgery, particularly large defects involving the midface, forehead, and scalp. While tissue expansion of the fronto-scalp flap offers a viable reconstructive option, the lengthy expansion period and the issue of post-expansion flap retraction necessitate further solutions.
OBJECTIVE: We conducted a prospective, comparative clinical study to investigate the role of Botulinum toxin in the expansion of fronto-scalp flaps.
METHOD: Between December 2019 and December 2024, 40 patients with large upper facial or scalp lesions were enrolled and randomly assigned to either the experimental group or the control group. Control group patients underwent tissue expansion combined with postoperative laser hair removal. Experimental group patients received the same tissue expansion and laser therapy, supplemented with Botulinum toxin injections administered both preoperatively (prior to expander implantation) and postoperatively in the forehead and scalp regions. We analyzed and compared parameters including expansion efficiency, post-expansion flap retraction force, postoperative pain scores, and complication rates between the two groups.
RESULTS: Baseline characteristics showed no significant differences between the two groups before expander implantation. During the tissue expansion phase, the experimental group demonstrated significantly higher expansion efficiency compared to the control group. At both 3 and 6 months following flap transfer surgery, the post-expansion flap retraction force was significantly lower in the experimental group than in the control group. However, no significant differences were observed in pain scores or complication rates between the two groups.
CONCLUSION: Our prospective, comparative study demonstrates that Botulinum toxin application enhances the efficiency of tissue expansion using the fronto-scalp flap for reconstructing large secondary facial and scalp defects. It also reduces post-expansion flap retraction force, ultimately contributing to favorable functional and aesthetic surgical outcomes.

Abstract:
With growing urbanization, there are increasing demands on waste management systems that can be performed in an environmentally friendly way as well as efficiently. Current approaches to managing waste often have issues with efficiency, transparency, and engaging with the public. Blockchain technology has been identified as one potential solution to these problems because it offers several benefits including decentralization, security, and transparency. The selection of the best blockchain-based waste management (BBWM) system is very difficult due to the many different evaluation criteria that may conflict with each other. Therefore this research uses a multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) approach using CIMAS (Criteria Importance Assessment), for determining weights based upon subjective input, and LOPCOW (Logarithmic Percentage Change-Driven Objective Weighing), for determining weights based upon objective data within the MCDM framework. To rank alternatives effectively, an Alternative Ranking Order Method Accounting for Two-Step Normalization (AROMAN) technique is applied, ensuring a precise evaluation process. The use of T-Spherical Fuzzy Sets (T-SFS) captures all three (membership, non-membership, hesitation degree) and is used to address the variability that exists when making an expert judgment. Some of the key factors include; Technological Feasibility, Operational Costs, Scalability, Data Security, Regulatory Compliance, Environmental Impact. Based on the evaluation criteria, it appears that the Blockchain Enabled Waste Tracking System is the most appropriate alternative due to its high potential for Transparency, Regulatory Compliance and Fraud Prevention. In addition, this research will provide Policymakers, Urban Planners and Investors with a methodical way of making Data Driven Decisions on BBWM Investments."

Abstract:
Surgical guides play a crucial role in achieving accurate implant placement, yet their physical presence often obstructs the clinician's view of the surgical site. Conventional methods for improving access using sutures or surgical instruments frequently introduce additional tools into the operative field, potentially hindering the surgical workflow. This technique article describes a straightforward yet effective modification to conventional implant guides by integrating retractor arms and attachment hooks on the buccal and lingual aspects. The arms gently displace the cheek and tongue, while the hooks retract the gingival flaps, collectively ensuring sufficient exposure of the alveolar bone crest. Importantly, these accessories can be designed using the existing connector-generation modules in common guide-design software programs and require no additional training with the program."

Abstract:
How does misinformation contribute to socioeconomic disparities in childhood vaccine uptake? While prior research has extensively examined the determinants of vaccination at the population-level, less attention has been paid to the mechanisms generating disparities across socioeconomic status (SES) groups. A fundamental cause theory perspective suggests that vaccination disparities driven by misinformation are due to unequal access to resources that enable higher-SES parents to avoid the influence of such misinformation. By contrast, a neoliberal cultural frames of parenting perspective suggests that higher-SES parents, in trying to avoid risks for their child, would be more receptive to inaccurate claims that arise outside the mainstream medical and scientific community. We test hypotheses from these two perspectives using 22 birth cohorts of Danish national health registry data (1990-2011) analyzing uptake of children's first dose of the measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine (MMR1) by parental education level in the context of three major vaccine misinformation events: two promoting and one correcting misinformation. We find that educational disparities in MMR1 uptake emerged following a 1993 national radio broadcast that falsely linked the vaccine to autism and helped catalyze anti-vaccine activism in Denmark. Children of parents with the lowest education were most severely impacted, and these disparities persisted through the 1998 publication and 2010 retraction of Andrew Wakefield's widely publicized MMR vaccine and autism study. Together, these findings generally support fundamental cause theory-based explanations and demonstrate persisting and unequal harms of misinformation on child and community health."

Abstract:
Repair of large soft tissue defects by tissue expansion often faces difficulties in skin expansion. Particularly in those who have lost a significant amount of skin and subcutaneous tissue due to total mastectomy, tissue expansion may result in skin breakdown and exposure of the expander. Subcutaneous fat construction by autologous fat grafting before expansion seems to assist skin expansion. We hypothesize that it may be related to the adipose-derived stem cells (ADSCs) in subcutaneous fat. In this study, we confirmed this phenomenon through animal experiments and provided a preliminary investigation of the possible mechanisms involved. Four groups were designed for the experiment, experimental group (EG) for autologous fat flap transfer and tissue expansion. Fat grafting control group (FGCG), where only autologous fat flap transfer was performed without tissue expansion. Tissue expansion control group (TECG) did not perform autologous fat flap transfer but only skin tissue expansion on the back. Blank control group (BCG) has not received any surgery. In each group of 20 rats, skin, and fat flaps of the dilated area were sampled at four time points (7, 14, 21, and 28 days, n = 5), and the immediate skin retraction rate of the expanded area in the EG and TECG groups was measured to evaluate the expansion effect. GFP+ADSCs were observed to demonstrate whether they were facilitated by tissue expansion and migrated from autologous fat flaps to skin. Our study supported that fat layer construction prior to skin expansion helps to promote skin growth. The promotion may be related to the migration of ADSCs from adipose to dermis by compression, and ADSCs migrating to dermis further promote skin stretching through direct differentiation or paracrine cytokines to promote cell proliferation and collagen synthesis."

Abstract:
Decentralized clinical trials (DCTs) have the potential to increase pace and reach of recruitment as well as to improve sample representation, compared to traditional in-person clinical trials. However, concerns linger regarding data integrity in DCTs due to threats of fraud and sampling bias. The purpose of this report is to describe two tools that we have developed and successfully implemented to combat these threats. Cheatblocker and QuotaConfig are two external modules that we have made publicly available within the REDCap data capture system to target fraud and sampling bias, respectively. We describe the modules, present two case examples in which we used the modules successfully, and discuss the potential impact of tools such as these on data integrity in DCTs. We situate this discussion within the broader landscape of translational science wherein we strive to improve research rigor and efficiency to maximize public health benefit."

Abstract:
RATIONALE: Pulmonary nodules are a common lung condition, and accurately determining their nature is crucial for doctors to develop appropriate treatment plans. Early identification of malignant nodules can improve patient survival rates. Therefore, accurately distinguishing between benign and malignant pulmonary nodules is essential for optimizing patient management and enhancing the efficiency of healthcare resource utilization.
PATIENT CONCERNS: The patient is a 53-year-old male. During a routine health examination, a calcified pulmonary nodule was identified. Initially, the nodule was considered benign due to its characteristic calcification and stable appearance on imaging. Over an 8-month follow-up period, serial imaging studies demonstrated no significant changes in the size or morphology of the nodule. Despite the absence of progression, the patient expressed concern regarding the possibility of lung cancer, prompting further diagnostic evaluation.
DIAGNOSES: Contrast-enhanced computed tomography scan revealed a mass-like high-density shadow in the anterior segment of the left upper lobe, with clear margins, measuring approximately 16 mm × 14 mm × 13 mm. The lesion is adjacent to the trachea and exhibits lobulation, spiculation, and pleural retraction. Calcification is present within the lesion, and blood vessels are seen entering it. The enhanced scan showed mild enhancement. Multiple nodules were observed near the pleura of the left lower lobe. All lung cancer-related tumor markers were negative. The patient underwent a thoracoscopic partial lobectomy (left upper and lower lobes) and thoracoscopic lymph node dissection. Postoperative pathology confirmed invasive lung adenocarcinoma with intrapulmonary metastasis.
INTERVENTIONS: The patient underwent surgical treatment, followed by genetic testing, which revealed anaplastic lymphoma kinase and AKT serine/threonine kinase 1 mutations. The patient is now receiving targeted therapy with ensartinib.
OUTCOMES: The patient was discharged 7 days post-surgery and is now on ensartinib for targeted therapy, with regular follow-up examinations scheduled.
LESSONS: This case emphasizes that nodules with diffuse, popcorn-like calcification do not rule out the possibility of lung cancer. A comprehensive evaluation integrating multidimensional imaging features is necessary. For nodules with conflicting imaging characteristics, minimally invasive surgical resection remains valuable for diagnosis. This approach broadens our diagnostic perspective on calcified nodules, enhances clinicians' understanding of lung adenocarcinoma, and reduces the rate of misdiagnosis."

Abstract:
PURPOSE: This study evaluates the thermodynamic benefits of including an irrigation fluid channel in the design of surgical guides used for dental implant site drilling.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Two types of guides suitable for hosting artificial bone plates that mimic the mechanical properties of human alveolar bone were designed: a classical guide (CLA-a splint with a guiding cylinder) and a guide with an internal coolant channel (INT). They were fabricated from titanium powder by selective laser melting. Graduated drillings were performed using a pilot bur followed by two larger ones; infrared thermography was used to record the temperature of the drill upon exit and the peak temperature of the specimen right after the bur's retraction.
RESULTS: The rise in bone temperature (mean ± standard deviation) while drilling through the CLA (INT) guide was 13.2 ± 3.6 (9.0 ± 3.4)°C for Drill 1, 4.3 ± 1.0 (2.1 ± 1.0)°C for Drill 2, and 2.1 ± 0.6 (0.4 ± 0.5)°C for Drill 3; the differences were statistically significant (p < 0.0032). To characterize individual differences between pairs of drillings conducted with different guides, Bland-Altman analysis was performed for the most thermogenic step. The mean difference between temperature elevations recorded with CLA and INT was -5.8°C, whereas the limits of agreement were 2.9°C and -14.4°C. In 95% of the cases, INT displayed more efficient cooling than CLA.
CONCLUSION: Surgical guides with incorporated coolant channels ensure better heat removal than conventional guides. Further research is needed to assess bone overheating within a few hundred micrometers from the osteotomy edge."

Optimal management remains controversial. We report exoscope-assisted intradural far-lateral resection of a retro-odontoid pseudotumor without fusion using the lateral position.
CASE DESCRIPTION: A 69-year-old male presented with progressive motor weakness and gait disturbance. MRI showed a retro-odontoid pseudotumor with severe spinal cord compression and intramedullary high signal intensity at C1-C2. Radiographs showed minimal atlantoaxial instability. We performed pseudotumor resection through the left intradural far-lateral approach with the patient in the right lateral decubitus position. Head fixation without rotation maintained consistent surgical orientation. This positioning allowed gravity-assisted spontaneous spinal cord displacement, avoiding active neural retraction. The exoscope provided clear oblique visualization of the ventral spinal cord from the posterolateral corridor. We sectioned the dentate ligaments and the left C2 posterior nerve root to expand operating space. The ventral dura was incised and internal debulking achieved partial resection with adequate decompression. Neuroendoscopic examination confirmed sufficient decompression. The patient was discharged without complications. Histopathology confirmed inflammatory tissue consistent with retro-odontoid pseudotumor. At three-month follow-up, neurological function improved significantly. At two years postoperatively, no symptom recurrence was noted.
CONCLUSION: Partial resection achieved effective neural decompression with favorable neurological recovery while preserving spinal mobility. The combination of lateral positioning for gravity-assisted minimal retraction, head fixation without rotation, and exoscopic visualization enabled precise joint-sparing tumor debulking. This strategy offers a viable option for symptomatic retro-odontoid pseudotumors without significant instability."

Abstract:
OBJECTIVES: To assess the acceleratory effect of locally administered injectable platelet-rich fibrin (i-PRF) on overall treatment duration (OTD) and root resorption.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients with anterior crowding requiring extraction of all four first premolars were randomized into i-PRF and control groups, both treated with fixed appliances. The i-PRF group received submucosal injection of i-PRF distal to all canines on the buccal and palatal sides, and canine retraction was performed using sectional mechanics. A second i-PRF injection was administered in the anterior interradicular region, followed by alignment up to 0.018 × 0.025″ stainless steel and space closure with NiTi closed coil springs (150 g). Control patients underwent the same protocol without i-PRF injections. Treatment duration was calculated; root resorption was assessed using cone-beam computed tomography, and volumetric analysis was accomplished using MIMICS software.
RESULTS: All 30 enrolled patients (17 females, 13 males; mean age 16.6 ± 2.7 years) completed the study, with 15 patients in each group. The mean OTD was 338.6 ± 37.8 days for the i-PRF group and 374.3 ± 49.3 days for the control group (P = .107). The percentage root volume loss for the central incisor was 3% and 4% in the intervention and control groups (P = .122), respectively, and 5% and 6% for the lateral incisor in the intervention and control groups (P = .767). Both the treatment duration and root volume loss in both groups were statistically and clinically nonsignificant.
CONCLUSIONS: The use of i-PRF did not significantly reduce OTD or affect root resorption compared with the control group."

Abstract:
INTRODUCTION: Individuals with compulsive buying-shopping disorder (CBSD) often engage in criminal behaviors like fraud and theft, influenced by materialistic values, impaired moral judgment, and low self-control. Psychological mechanisms linking CBSD and criminality are yet not well understood. This study examines psychological/personality factors contributing to criminal tendencies in individuals with CBSD.
METHODS: An online survey recruited participants through social media, websites, and academic institutions. Eligible participants were ≥18 years with German language skills. Ethical approval was granted by Hannover Medical School. Measures included the Pathological Buying Screener (PBS), Materialistic Value Scale, Big Five Inventory, Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale, the Dirty Dozen for Dark Triad traits, and a self-developed questionnaire on criminal behavior.
RESULTS: Forty-three participants scored above (CBSD+) and 166 participants below (CBSD-) the PBS cutoff for CBSD. The CBSD+ group showed higher materialism, lower self-esteem, elevated Dark Triad traits, and more criminal behaviors compared to the CBSD- group. Nearly 70% of the CBSD+ group reported at least one criminal behavior. A multiple linear regression (enter method) identified higher PBS scores, younger age, and lower extraversion as predictors of more criminal buying-shopping-related behaviors.
CONCLUSION: The findings reveal the intricate factors contributing to criminal behavior in CBSD. The lack of significant association between neuroticism, dark personality features and the amount of criminal behaviors needs further investigation. The explained variance of 39% indicates that additional influences on criminal behavior remain to be explored. Future research should aim for more diverse samples and longitudinal designs to enhance generalizability and understanding of these complex relationships."

Abstract:
Koro-like syndrome (KLS) is considered a non-epidemic, culturally decontextualized variant of Koro, a culture-bound syndrome first identified in Southeast Asia. Classic Koro is marked by acute anxiety and the belief that one's genitalia are retracting into the body, often occurring in epidemic clusters influenced by cultural and societal beliefs. In contrast, KLS arises in non-endemic settings and is typically seen in individuals with underlying psychiatric conditions - such as obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), psychosis, or delusional disorders - without the presence of shared cultural narratives. We report the case of a 24-year-old Egyptian male with a history of OCD with poor insight and somatic delusional disorder who presented with persistent preoccupation about perceived testicular atrophy. He attributed this belief to a hormonal imbalance and exhibited a waddling gait to avoid pressure on his genitalia. Despite repeated medical reassurances and normal hormonal evaluations, he remained firmly convinced that his testes were undergoing atrophy. This case highlights the diagnostic and therapeutic challenges of KLS in non-endemic settings, particularly when embedded within broader psychopathology. This underscores the importance of recognizing somatic delusions that occur outside traditional cultural frameworks and adapting treatment approaches to address the underlying psychopathology."

Abstract:
INTRODUCTION: Workplace violence refers to incidents in which individuals are subjected to abuse, misconduct, or threats in professional settings, endangering their health, safety, and well-being. Violence against nurses has reached high levels in recent years. This study aimed to identify the causes of violence against nurses and effective strategies for its prevention in developed countries.
METHODS: This scoping review was conducted in 2024 following the PRISMA-ScR guidelines. A comprehensive search was performed across international databases of PubMed, Scopus, PsycInfo, and Web of Science that covering studies published between 2003 and 2024. The search strategy combined keywords and MeSH terms related to ""nurses"" and ""violence"". Data extraction was completed using a structured form, and thematic content analysis was employed to synthesize the findings.
RESULTS: From 2658 identified records, 414 duplicates were removed. After screening and reviewing the full-texts, 114 studies were included. The causes of violence against nurses were categorized into five domains: individuals-level factors related to patients and companions, also staff-related factors, organizational factors, social determinants, and political drivers. Interventions for violence reduction were classified across three stages of before, during, and after violent incidents and addressed individual, organizational, social, and policy levels.
CONCLUSION: The findings demonstrate that workplace violence against nurses is a multifactorial issue driven by individual factors related to patients and healthcare staff, as well as broader organizational, social, and political determinants. In sum, creating safer work environments for nurses requires a coordinated, multi-level approach that addresses both immediate risks and the underlying structural drivers of violence.

Abstract:
Autoimmune-associated orbital inflammation refers to the inflammation of orbital tissues resulting from immune system dysregulation. Interleukin-17 (IL-17) plays a critical role in immune defense, tissue repair, inflammation, and tumor progression. Given its immunomodulatory functions, this study aimed to investigate whether single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in IL17-related genes contribute to susceptibility and clinical manifestations of orbital autoimmune diseases. A total of 60 patients with orbital autoimmune disease and 60 healthy controls were recruited. Candidate SNPs in IL17A, IL17F, IL17RA, and IL17RC were selected based on known hotspots, including 500 bp upstream and downstream flanking regions. Associations between SNPs and disease status, as well as clinical features such as pain, diplopia, conjunctival inflammation, and eyelid retraction, were analyzed using chi-square or Fisher's exact tests. The analysis revealed that rs9791323 in the promoter region of the IL17A gene was significantly associated with disease susceptibility (p = 0.045) but not with specific clinical features. Other SNPs were found to correlate with distinct symptoms: in IL17A, rs3804513 was associated with pain (p = 0.012); rs3819024 and rs2275913 with diplopia (p = 0.007 and 0.028, respectively); and rs8193036 with both diplopia (p = 0.002) and eyelid retraction (p = 0.033). In IL17F, rs9463772 was associated with pain (p = 0.005), while rs4715290 and rs11465530 were linked to eyelid retraction (p = 0.014 and 0.030, respectively). Three SNPs in IL17RA-rs4819553, rs4819958, and rs4819554-were significantly associated with conjunctival inflammation (p = 0.012). The IL17RC SNP rs708567 was also related to eyelid retraction (p = 0.049). In conclusion, rs9791323 in IL17A may contribute to disease susceptibility, while other IL17-related SNPs appear to influence specific clinical features. These findings highlight the potential role of IL17 gene variants in both the pathogenesis and phenotypic variability of autoimmune-associated orbital inflammation."

Abstract:
OBJECTIVE: In skull-base surgery, excessive brain retraction may cause brain retraction injury (BRI), yet the brain retraction distance (BRD) that contributes to BRI and the potential of skull-base approaches to reduce BRD remain unclear. This study used a virtual reality (VR)-based method to quantify BRD related to BRI and to assess the impact of skull-base approaches on reducing BRD.
METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 18 patients who underwent frontotemporal craniotomy for anterior skull-base tumors. Three-dimensional models were generated from perioperative imaging, and the frontal lobe was virtually elevated on the 3D model to reproduce the surgical exposure. BRD was estimated by comparing pre- and post-retraction configurations, and its association with BRI was assessed. Additionally, a virtual orbitotomy was performed to evaluate how much BRD could be reduced with this approach.
RESULTS: Four patients developed BRI. The median BRD was 6.2 mm in the non-BRI group, whereas it was 12.2 mm in the BRI group, demonstrating a significant difference. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis identified 10.1 mm as the optimal cutoff value for predicting BRI, yielding a sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of 92.9%. The median BRD decreased from 8.3 mm to 5.8 mm after adding an orbitotomy on the 3D model, with the greatest reduction observed in cases requiring larger BRD.
CONCLUSION: VR-based preoperative measurement of BRD may help assess both the risk of BRI and the potential benefit of skull-base approaches. This technique could support selecting an optimal surgical strategy by considering the anticipated BRD for each patient."

Abstract:
We developed LamelliQuant, an automated image analysis pipeline for quantifying lamellipodial protrusion and retraction dynamics from time-lapse microscopy of migrating cells. The workflow begins with the generation of kymographs along user-defined lines across lamellipodia, capturing edge motion over time. An image analysis algorithm extracts the cell edge trajectory and applies LOESS smoothing combined with peak detection to identify cycles of protrusion and retraction. LamelliQuant integrates ImageJ for image processing (movie import, ROI selection, kymograph generation) and R for quantitative analysis (smoothing and event detection), with user-adjustable parameters throughout to enable customization. We validated the pipeline by comparing automated measurements to manual tracking, demonstrating strong concordance and the ability to reproduce published results. LamelliQuant offers a robust, high-throughput alternative to manual kymograph analysis for investigating lamellipodia and membrane protrusion dynamics."

Abstract:
BACKGROUND: This study evaluated three-dimensional changes in incisive canal (IC) morphology, root-IC proximity, and apical root resorption following fixed orthodontic retraction, comparing extraction and non-extraction protocols.
METHODS: CBCT scans of 86 patients (172 maxillary central incisors; mean age 22.3 ± 5.7 years) were analyzed before (T1) and immediately after treatment (T2). Participants were assigned to extraction (n = 42) or non-extraction (n = 44) groups. Linear measurements (IC width, cortical bone width, root-IC distance, U1 length/width, IC height) were recorded at three vertical levels (H1-H3). IC and U1 volumes and surface areas were quantified using standardized 3D segmentation. Continuous group comparisons were performed using patient-averaged data, whereas incisor-level categorical outcomes were analyzed using cluster-adjusted statistical models. Root-IC proximity patterns were evaluated using Generalized Estimating Equations (GEE), and apical root resorption and volumetric changes were assessed using Linear Mixed Models (LMM). Predictors of root-IC contact/invasion and predictors of root-IC distance reduction were examined using multivariable GEE and LMM, respectively. Multiplicity was controlled using Holm-Bonferroni correction.
RESULTS: IC width and cortical bone width decreased at several levels in both groups, more prominently in extraction cases (P < 0.05). Root-IC distance decreased in all patients, with an adjusted overall mean reduction of 1.33 mm (95% CI, 1.28-1.37). LMM showed no independent effect of extraction status on root-IC distance change (B = 0.08, P = 0.079). Each millimeter of U1 retraction produced an additional 0.40 mm reduction in root-IC distance (95% CI, 0.37-0.43; P < 0.001). GEE demonstrated that each millimeter of U1 movement increased the odds of root-IC contact or invasion by 1.76-fold (95% CI, 1.21-2.56; adjusted P = 0.030). Apical root resorption was significantly higher in teeth showing canal contact or invasion, with an average 0.38 mm greater shortening compared with separated roots (95% CI, 0.08-0.69).
CONCLUSION: Changes in root-IC proximity during orthodontic retraction are driven primarily by the magnitude of tooth movement, not extraction status. Greater retraction increases both canal approximation and the likelihood of contact/invasion, which in turn intensifies apical root resorption. Pre-treatment CBCT assessment of IC morphology and careful force and torque control are essential to minimize biomechanical overload and reduce iatrogenic risk during orthodontic retraction."

Abstract:
Apple juice is widely consumed for its pleasant sensory attributes and nutritional value. However, due to its high commercial value, this beverage, particularly whole juice, is susceptible to fraud and adulteration. This underscores the need for rapid, noninvasive analytical strategies to ensure product authenticity and quality. This study reports, for the first time, the application of smartphone-based image analysis combined with machine learning as a low-cost and nondestructive approach for both classifying apple juice types and predicting the actual juice content in apple-based beverages. Images of nine whole juice (WJ), four reconstituted juice (RE), and five nectar (NE) samples were analyzed to develop models capable of discriminating beverage categories and estimating apple juice concentration. Classification models generated using k-nearest neighbors (kNN) and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) algorithms achieved good global accuracies of 95.9% (99.1% and 100.0% in training and 95.9% in testing), with cross-validation accuracies of 98.7% and 95.5%, respectively. Predictive models constructed from calibration curves (5-100% apple juice) combined with commercial samples yielded good estimates for coefficients of determination (R 2 = 93.1-93.5% in testing, 97.7-96.2% in training, and 91.9-92.4% in cross-validation) and root-mean-square errors (RMSE = 8.0-8.2%) for models generated by XGBoost and CatBoost, respectively. These findings demonstrate the scientific novelty and practical feasibility of integrating smartphone imaging with machine learning for the quantitative analysis of apple juice. The proposed approach represents a rapid, accurate, and cost-effective alternative for industrial quality control and regulatory inspection."

Abstract:
Cesarean delivery is the most prevalent major surgical procedure in the United States. The traditional Pfannenstiel technique has long been the standard approach due to its cosmetic benefits and reduced postoperative complications compared to the vertical incisions. However, its reliance on extensive dissection and traditions, rather than robust scientific evidence, has prompted exploration of minimally invasive alternatives. The Pelosi simplified cesarean technique, introduced in 1994, and the Mobius Elastic Abdominal Retractor, developed by the authors in the early 2000s, represented substantial advancements in cesarean delivery, aiming to enhance surgical efficiency, reduce complications, and improve patient recovery. This technique employs limited subcutaneous and rectus fascia division, blunt midline rectus muscles separation, and digital peritoneal entry; eliminates the bladder flap; utilizes a vertical hysterotomy expansion instead of the traditional transverse hysterotomy; eliminates peritoneal closure; and employs in situ 1 single-layer hysterotomy closure. The OB/Mobius Elastic Abdominal Retractor, a flexible self-retaining device, enhances exposure through atraumatic 360-degrees retraction. This presentation reviews the procedural steps of the procedure. The Pelosi simplified cesarean technique and the OB/Mobius retractor mark a strategic shift in cesarean delivery, addressing limitations of the traditional Pfannenstiel method. By minimizing dissection, eliminating unnecessary steps, and optimizing surgical exposure, these innovations were found to reduce operative time, complications, and costs while improving recovery in clinical studies."

Abstract:
The ""cesarean apron,"" also known as a cesarean bulge, pouch, or shelf, is a frequent but often overlooked postoperative deformity of the lower abdominal wall that may occur even after uncomplicated cesarean delivery. It is characterized by redundant skin and subcutaneous adipose tissue that overhangs the cesarean scar, producing a contour irregularity that ranges from a mild suprapubic bulge to a large apron extending below the mons pubis. This deformity affects both obese and nonobese patients and is frequently dismissed as a cosmetic concern or attributed to weight gain. However, it can cause physical discomfort, skin irritation, and considerable psychological distress, negatively affecting body image and self-esteem. We propose that the cesarean apron results primarily from incomplete or absent closure of the Scarpa fascia during cesarean wound repair. The Scarpa fascia is a fibroelastic membranous layer that separates the superficial (Camper's layer) and deep subcutaneous fat layers of the anterior abdominal wall. We also propose that when left open, the fascial edges retract, creating a potential space that allows deep fat to herniate upward into the superficial plane, producing a pseudolipoma-like bulge. As healing progresses, fibrosis and tissue contractions above and below the gap lead to scar tethering and depression, resulting in a persistent contour deformity. In some patients, the lower fascial edge retracts downward, pulling the mons pubis caudally and contributing to its descent or ptosis. A four-grade classification a system is outlined to describe the severity of this deformity: grade 1 involves a mild suprapubic bulge with minimal fat excess; grade 2 shows moderate bulging covering the scar; grade 3 presents a large apron extending below the scar with infraumbilical rectus diastasis; and grade 4 features a large apron extending to or below the mons pubis with generalized abdominal laxity and deep scar depression. Treatment options range from liposuction and limited scar revision for milder cases to mini- or full abdominoplasty with rectus plication for advanced deformities. Routine closure of the Scarpa fascia, a standard practice in abdominoplasty but rarely performed in obstetrics, can restore fascial continuity, reduces dead space, strengthens the wound, and helps prevent postoperative contour irregularities. This simple and rapid modification of cesarean technique can improve long-term esthetic and functional outcomes without increasing operative morbidity."

Abstract:
BACKGROUND: Several illicit drugs have been reported to be associated with ischemic stroke and myocardial infarction. However, the underlying mechanisms remain poorly investigated. In this study, we focused on N-Ethylpentylone (NEP), a synthetic cathinone with potent hallucinogenic property and explored its role in platelet activation.
METHODS: Platelet function assays and flow cytometry were used to evaluate the effects of NEP on platelet aggregation, spreading, clot retraction, and integrin αIIbβ3 activation. The role of the 5-Hydroxytryptamine2A receptor (5-HT2AR) in NEP-mediated platelet responses was investigated using the selective 5-HT2AR antagonist M100907 in both ex vivo and in vivo. Phosphoproteomics identified NEP-regulated phosphorylation sites, and Western blotting validated mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway activation by targeting key phosphorylation nodes.
RESULTS: NEP significantly potentiated platelet aggregation, spreading, clot retraction, and integrin αIIbβ3 activation in a concentration-dependent manner. The NEP potentiated platelet responses were suppressed by M100907 in both ex vivo and in vivo models, confirming the critical regulatory role of 5-HT2AR. Phosphoproteomics revealed NEP-triggered phosphorylation upregulation, enriched in MAPK pathways. Western blotting confirmed selective ERK and p38 phosphorylation, with no effect on JNK.
CONCLUSION: NEP directly enhances agonist-induced platelet activation by targeting 5-HT2AR on platelet membranes. The findings of this study provide valuable insights for elucidating the hematotoxic mechanisms of NEP and other illicit drugs."

Abstract:
Addressing the challenge of geographical origin fraud in mung beans is pivotal, as accurate traceability is fundamental to preserving their quality-specific attributes, protecting branded origins, and ensuring supply chain integrity. In this study, a proposed Global Spectral Feature Classification Network (GSFC-Net) coupled with a hyperspectral system is proposed to identify the quality differences of mung beans from different origins. Using the hyperspectral system, spectral information of mung beans from six different origins is collected and preprocessed. We propose the Global Spectral Feature Calculation Module (GSFCM), which integrates convolution, self-attention, and residual connection to extract full-band deep features that effectively represent the original spectral information. The GSFC-Net is designed to self-adaptively establish a nonlinear mapping between the original spectral information and the origin labels. The rationality of GSFC-NET is verified through structural optimization and ablation experiments. Compared with the state-of-the-art spectral information classification methods, GSFC-Net achieves outstanding classification performance and stability, with an accuracy of 98.10%, precision of 98.09%, recall of 98.55%, and an F1-score of 98.32%. In conclusion, this study presents an effective analytical method for identifying mung bean origin, providing a technical method to ensure product authenticity and support fair trade in the market."

Abstract:
BACKGROUND: Arterial thrombotic diseases are leading causes of global morbidity and mortality, primarily driven by platelet hyperactivity. Qiliqiangxin capsules (QLQX), a traditional Chinese medicine approved in China for the treatment of heart failure, have exhibited potential benefits in reducing cardiovascular death. However, its direct effects on platelet activation and thrombosis remain unclear.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Ex vivo platelet function assays demonstrated that oral QLQX inhibited agonist‑induced aggregation in platelet‑rich plasma (PRP) from chronic heart failure (CHF) patients and dose-dependently suppressed washed platelet aggregation in wild‑type mice. In parallel, QLQX administration attenuated platelet spreading and clot retraction in washed platelets from both patients with CHF and wild-type mice, and reduced ex vivo thrombus formation area in a microfluidic whole‑blood perfusion under arterial shear stress. Flow cytometry analysis revealed that QLQX did not affect the surface expression levels of the major platelet receptors, but reduced the activation of αIIbβ3 and P-selectin exposure induced by thrombin in mouse platelets. In vivo experiments demonstrated that QLQX treatment inhibited FeCl₃-induced thrombus formation in mesenteric arterioles, reduced collagen/epinephrine-induced pulmonary embolism, and mitigated microvascular thrombosis during myocardial ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury, without increasing bleeding in mice. RNA sequencing of platelets from QLQX- versus vehicle-treated mice identified differentially expressed genes enriched in the calcium signaling pathway, and functional assays demonstrated that QLQX inhibited agonist-induced platelet Ca²⁺ influx and PKC phosphorylation.
CONCLUSION: QLQX inhibits platelet activation and thrombosis by targeting Ca²⁺ influx and PKC signaling, supporting its potential therapeutic value in preventing thrombotic complications.

Abstract:
Oligodendrocytes, the myelinating cells of the central nervous system, precisely sculpt their insulating membranes to match axon size, ensuring fine-tuned action potential propagation. How oligodendrocytes estimate axon caliber to adapt myelin sheath geometry is unknown. The biochemical measure of axonal size provided by neuregulin 1 for Schwann cells is dispensable in oligodendrocytes, and we reasoned that biophysical cues might instead be required. By combining transcriptomics, in vivo optical imaging, and electron microscopy in mouse and zebrafish models, we identified TMEM63A as a key mechanosensitive channel in oligodendrocytes. TMEM63A enabled oligodendrocytes to sense membrane stretch and translate it into Ca2+ signals. In the absence of TMEM63A, developmental myelination was severely impaired with shorter and thinner myelin sheaths on large-diameter axons, ectopic myelination of very small-diameter axons, and increased sheath retractions. We propose MYO5A-dependent Mbp mRNA targeting to the nascent myelin sheaths as a mechanism linking stretch-activated Ca2+ signaling to myelin formation and sheath geometry refinement."

The data collected included the demographics, clinical features including the ophthalmic and systemic manifestations, and management outcomes.ResultsThe average age at presentation was 42.71 (±18.73) years. Majority were males (83%). Syndromic associations included Down's syndrome (2%) and Ehler-Danlos syndrome (1%). Of the 45 investigated, obstructive sleep apnea was diagnosed in 24% cases. Adnexal manifestations included concurrent lower eyelid laxity (70%), blepharoptosis (41%) of which 38% were aponeurotic, lower eyelid retraction (37%), chalazia (25%) of which 58% were either recurrent, multiple, or both, lacrimal gland (LG) prolapse (11%), lash ptosis (11%), lower eyelid ectropion (8%), entropion (5%), and recurrent dacryoadenitis (3%). Chronic papillary conjunctivitis (66%) was the most common ocular surface abnormality followed by meibomian gland dysfunction (31%). Seven cases (7%) had eyelid imbrication syndrome (EIS), of which 60% had retinopathy of prematurity. Surgical management was recommended in 25% cases, indications being ptosis (13%), generalized eyelid laxity (11%), and recurrent globe luxation (2%).ConclusionUL hyperlaxity can be associated with a myriad of ophthalmic manifestations. One should look for novel findings such as EIS, dacryoadenitis, LG prolapse, and lower eyelid retraction in these cases."

Abstract:
BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Dental intrusion often constitutes an integral part of orthodontic treatment in order to improve sagittal and vertical incisor relationships and consequently, the gingival line, and restore the aesthetics of smiling. The use of mini-implants as skeletal anchorage has seen a dramatic compliance from patients, who would otherwise have not preferred to undergo a surgical option. A prospective clinical study was conducted to evaluate the dental, skeletal and soft tissue effects of intrusion and retraction of maxillary anterior teeth using three mini-implants.
METHODS AND MATERIAL: Twenty-two patients seeking orthodontic treatment requiring intrusion and retraction of maxillary anterior teeth as part of treatment were selected as study samples. After initial levelling and alignment, mini-implants were placed into the alveolar bone between the roots of the maxillary first molar and second premolar on either side and one into the alveolar bone between the roots of the maxillary central incisors. A total of 22 parameters were evaluated from the lateral cephalograms, taken before initiation of retraction and intrusion and immediately after complete space closure and intrusion.
STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: A paired t -test was used to compare the changes.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: Mini-implants provide absolute anchorage in both horizontal and vertical planes, bringing about significant dental, skeletal and soft tissue changes, and absolute intrusion and retraction of maxillary anterior teeth can be achieved without significant changes in incisor angulation."

Abstract:
Organophosphorus compounds are widely used in agriculture, but their poisoning poses a great threat. This study focuses on exploring the therapeutic effects of rePON1Q192 and rePON1R192 on mice poisoned with different types of organophosphorus compounds. These two recombinant proteins are prepared via gene synthesis into the pET - 32a vector and expression in E. coli BL21.Organophosphorus compounds are divided into two groups by structure: one group contained a pyrimidine ring (similar in structure to diazinon), and the other group contained multiple chlorine atoms (similar in structure to chlorpyrifos). Each group included a control group, a rePON1Q/R192 control group, a poisoned group, and a rePON1Q/R192 treatment group. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis assessed the 12-h survival proportion of mice per group. Use ELISA to detect IL - 6 expression, HE staining to assess lung and brain injuries, TUNEL staining to observe apoptosis in brain and lung tissues, and electron microscopy to examine mitochondrial structural changes in brain tissues and alterations in lung tissues of each group. The results showed that rePON1Q/R192 could improve the clinical manifestations of mice with organophosphorus poisoning, increase the survival proportion, reduce the release of the inflammatory factor IL - 6, alleviate the pathological damage of brain and lung tissues, as well as mitochondrial damage. The number of apoptotic cells in the brain and lung tissues of mice in the rePON1Q/R192 treatment group was significantly reduced. In animal experiments, the therapeutic effects vary: rePON1Q192 is better for diazinon poisoning, while rePON1R192 is better for chlorpyrifos-like poisoning. Thus, the therapeutic effects of rePON1Q192 and rePON1R192 vary depending on the type of organophosphorus poison, likely due to differences in their molecular structures."

Abstract:
Depending on their origin, strawberries can vary greatly in price. For example, fruit from Germany may be costly compared to imported goods, encouraging financially motivated food fraud. In this study, two different sample preparation techniques - acid digestion and laser ablation - were applied to determine the provenance of strawberries using ICP-MS and multivariate data analysis. 403 samples from six countries (Egypt, Germany, Greece, the Netherlands, Poland and Spain) were used to develop classification models. German and imported strawberries were distinguished with an accuracy of 91.7 % using solution nebulization. Strawberry seeds were identified as optimal matrix for the alternative laser ablation method. With laser ablation, a two-class classification model with an accuracy of 88.0 ± 12.1 % provided the best result. The classical SN-ICP-MS provides a very good classification result; however, it requires more reagents and time compared to the innovative and resource-efficient LA-ICP-MS, making it a realistic tool for food fraud detection."

Abstract:
Red pepper powder (RPP), derived from Capsicum annuum L., is vulnerable to adulteration with fungal-spoiled RPP for profit. This study aimed to detect fungal spoilage in RPP by integrating non-targeted analysis (NTA) and targeted analysis (TA) of non-polar metabolites using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. NTA revealed significant differences in free fatty acid profiles between unspoiled and fungal-spoiled RPP (p < 0.05), specifically due to Alternaria alternata and Colletotrichum acutatum infections. Partial least squares discriminant analysis distinguished the groups and identified palmitic, linoleic, and oleic acids as key markers. TA confirmed significantly elevated levels of these fatty acids in spoiled samples (p < 0.05). A blind test demonstrated spoilage detection at a minimum of 2.5 w/w%, even when mixed with unspoiled samples. These findings establish a reliable approach for identifying fungal spoilage in RPP, offering valuable insights for food safety monitoring and quality control. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: This approach offers a reliable tool for food manufacturers, quality control laboratories, and regulatory agencies to verify the authenticity and safety of RPP products. By enabling early and sensitive detection of fungal spoilage, it helps prevent economic fraud and supports consumer health protection. Adoption of this method could strengthen quality assurance protocols and guide regulatory standards in the RPP industry."

Abstract:
BACKGROUND: Alcohol consumption worldwide is associated with a range of health and societal problems. Epidemiology data are valuable tools for predicting the outcome of a given behaviour on the general population's health. This study aimed to evaluate the patterns of alcohol consumption among Buea inhabitants.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: This cross-sectional study involves 422 participants (244 men and 178 women) aged 15 years and above who have been residents of the Buea municipality for more than a year. This study was conducted from March to May 2019 using a semi-structured questionnaire. The questionnaire included socio-demographic information and the 10 items of the Alcohol Use Disorder Identification Test (AUDIT).
RESULTS: The results obtained showed that many of the alcohol misusers were men. 34.6 % of the participants indicated drinking above the recommended levels. 93.8 % of the respondents admitted to consuming alcohol in the company of others, mostly in bars. Beer was the leading alcoholic beverage consumed in Buea. Alcohol intake for pleasure and to relieve stress were among the leading causes of alcohol drinking in the study population. The vast majority of participants reported misbehavior after alcohol intake. The number of women with AUDIT C score greater than 5 was also significant. Aggressivity, memory loss, and falls after drinking were also recorded in the study population.
CONCLUSION: The alcohol consumption patterns in Buea are associated with many behavioral misconducts. Therefore, there is a need for community education to curve the incidence of neurological diseases and alcohol addiction behaviour in the Buea municipality."

Abstract:
How affective polarization in Western democracies results from the interplay of ideological differences and group identification remains unclear. To better understand these processes and address the call for falsifiable theories, we propose a formalized Expectancy-Value Model of Interpersonal Likability in Politics (EVIL-P). It argues that people (dis)like targets with (dis)similar political views (i.e., value), especially if these views are rare (i.e., expectancy). By reanalyzing data from the American National Election Studies (N = 38,868), the British Election Study (N = 24,522), and nine studies on ratings of societal groups that vary in political views (N = 6,587), we find support for EVIL-P. Expectancy and value interacted to predict people's attitudes. Moreover, targets with moderate political views were liked most on average, and targets with more extreme political views had more extreme fans and haters. We discuss how EVIL-P contributes to research on affective polarization and helps testing related phenomena."

Abstract:
Research integrity has become a pressing concern in China, which accounts for a large share of global retractions. Yet little is known about how research integrity is understood and enacted within teaching hospitals. In this cross-sectional study, we surveyed 106 medical researchers across four Shanghai hospitals to assess their awareness, attitudes, and practices regarding scientific misconduct, as well as the role of integrity education. Most respondents reported familiarity with definitions of fabrication, falsification, and plagiarism and expressed strong disapproval of these behaviors. Nonetheless, 11%-22% indicated some degree of tolerance toward selective reporting or unjustified authorship, and firsthand reports of witnessed misconduct were uncommon. Participation in formal courses or lectures on research integrity was associated with higher knowledge scores and stronger agreement with ethical principles. These findings reveal a tension between high awareness and partial tolerance, highlighting the importance of exploring how institutional cultures and incentive systems may influence ethical behavior in future research and policy efforts."

Abstract:
PURPOSE: This study aimed to assess the potential role of large language models in the postoperative management of lower lid blepharoplasty patients.
METHODS: This study employed a cross-sectional design to evaluate the content validity of ChatGPT-4's responses to common postoperative concerns following lower lid blepharoplasty: bleeding, diplopia, dry eyes, pain, lower lid retraction, and bruising/hematoma/orbital hemorrhage. Twelve American Society of Ophthalmic Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery physicians graded the responses for clinical accuracy on a 5-point Likert scale and assessed the appropriateness of management recommendations. Flesch Reading Ease scores and Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level were generated to assess readability. The Patient Education Materials Assessment Tool was utilized to evaluate understandability and actionability of each response.
RESULTS: Average accuracy grades for the 6 responses ranged from 4.33 to 4.67 out of 5, with an overall average of 4.50 ± 0.63. The proportion of graders who deemed ChatGPT-4's patient management recommendations appropriate ranged from 75.0% to 100% across the 6 responses. Flesch Reading Ease scores ranged from 28.9 to 50.2, with Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level scores ranging from grade 9.4 to 13.4 for reading level. The average Patient Education Materials Assessment Tool understandability score was 91.67 ± 0.52%, while all 6 responses received an actionability score of 60%.
CONCLUSIONS: ChatGPT-4 showed promise as a supportive tool for postoperative care following lower lid blepharoplasty, with generally accurate and appropriate responses. However, further refinement is needed before it can be considered a reliable clinical resource. Ongoing physician involvement in the development and evaluation of medical AI will be critical to ensuring these technologies are safe, accurate, and capable of meaningfully enhancing patient care."

Abstract:
PURPOSE: To compare race, sex, and ethnicity of thyroid eye disease patients who were and were not prescribed teprotumumab.
METHODS: This retrospective, comparative study used TriNetX health record database to compare race, sex, and ethnicity distributions between patients who were and were not prescribed teprotumumab from 2020 to 2025. Patients with at least one thyroid eye disease sign (exophthalmos, eyelid retraction, strabismus) and elevated thyroid stimulating immunoglobulin (≥1.30 index value) were included. Subanalysis examining 2020-2023 and 2023-2025 periods was conducted.
RESULTS: There were 293 patients prescribed teprotumumab and 4125 controls. Significant racial disparities existed between controls and teprotumumab patients (χ2 = 25.1414, p < 0.0001). Odds of White patients receiving teprotumumab were 2.52 (99% CI: 1.51-4.21) times higher than Black patients but not significantly different from patients of other races. Subanalysis showed significant racial disparities from 2020 to 2023 (χ2 = 23.5221, p < 0.0001), but these differences were not statistically significant from 2023 to 2025 (χ2 = 4.0007, p = 0.1353). No significant ethnic- or sex-based disparities were found.
CONCLUSIONS: White patients were disproportionately more likely to be prescribed teprotumumab than Black patients, potentially due to prescriber bias, socioeconomic challenges, and medical distrust. Trends show progress towards more equitable distribution."

Abstract:
Detecting anomalies in multivariate time series (MTS) is a crucial task in areas like financial fraud detection and industrial equipment monitoring. Recent research has focused on developing unsupervised probabilistic models to identify anomalous patterns within MTS. However, many of these methods rely on fixed parameter mappings for each MTS, resulting in high computational costs and limited adaptability. To overcome these challenges, we introduce a novel Meta Variational Memory Transformer (MVMT). MVMT captures the diverse patterns across various MTS by encoding them into a set of memory units using a specially developed meta memory attention (MMA) module. Utilizing these learned memory units, we introduce a memory-guided probabilistic generative model that selects relevant memories as priors for latent states, resulting in more expressive MTS representations. A key feature of MVMT is that MMA provides a diversified prior in the latent space, ensuring the generation of various patterns. Finally, we implement a Transformer-based upward-downward variational inference process to estimate the posterior distribution of latent variables. Our extensive experiments on six datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of MVMT in one-for-all anomaly detection tasks."

Abstract:
Coerced debt is an important but understudied form of intimate partner violence. It occurs when abusive partners use fraud, coercion, or manipulation to incur debt in their partners' names. For the current study, we sampled 187 women who had recently divorced an abusive husband and their combined 2,833 credit accounts to answer the questions: (1) On what types of credit accounts and using what types of transactions (i.e., fraud, coercion, and manipulation) did ex-husbands create coerced debt in their partners' names? (2) How much money was spent and what items were purchased? and (3) What reasons did ex-husbands give for pressuring participants to open accounts in their names that resulted in coerced debt? We collected data via an online survey and telephone interview. We analyzed quantitative data with descriptive statistics and responses to open-ended questions with inductive thematic analysis. The findings indicated that coerced debt is a common and expensive problem with a wide variety of presentations. The 116 participants with coerced debt had a mean of 4.4 and a maximum of 24 such debts and owed a combined total of over 12.5 million dollars. The most common types of accounts with coerced debt were credit cards, vehicle loans, mortgages, personal loans, and student loans. Coercive transactions were much more common than debt created by fraudulent transactions. Coerced debt was used for basic necessities, lifestyle purchases, transportation, the ex-husbands' personal interests, financial needs and obligations, and other household members' needs. The most common reason ex-husbands gave for putting accounts in their partners' names was personal resource adequacy. This study indicates the need for future research on the effects of coerced debt and the effectiveness of interventions to address it; screening tools and practices for use in direct service settings; and laws that address debt created by coercive transactions."

Abstract:
INTRODUCTION: Liposuction is the most frequently performed aesthetic procedure worldwide, with a 38.6% increase in the past decade. Advances in technology have transformed the procedure from simple fat removal to a sculpting technique. Argoplasma, a monopolar electrosurgical device, is gaining attention for enhancing skin retraction. This study evaluates complications and satisfaction following the use of Argoplasma after liposuction.
METHODS: A multicenter retrospective study was conducted in Brazil, with patients who underwent liposuction with AP between January 2022 and December 2023. Data were collected from 41 surgeons via questionnaire. Inclusion criteria comprised adults without comorbidities and a minimum of six months follow-up. Variables analyzed included demographics, surgical characteristics, Argoplasma settings, and complications. Statistical significance was set at p<0.05.
RESULTS: A total of 594 patients were included. Most patients were female (92.9%), with a mean age of 39.3 years and BMI of 25. Complications occurred in 9.4% of cases, with seroma (3.4%) and thermal injuries (2.7%) being most common. Significant risk factors for seroma included lower BMI, procedures exceeding five hours, and liposuction without adjunct surgery. No increased risk was found in patients undergoing abdominal flap undermining. Satisfaction with skin retraction was high, with mean scores of 8.9 (patients) and 8.8 (surgeons) on a 10-point scale.
CONCLUSION: Argolasma used following liposuction is associated with a low complication rate and high satisfaction. Seroma remains the most frequent complication, with identifiable risk factors. Argoplasma appears safe even in procedures involving abdominal undermining, supporting its role in enhancing aesthetic outcomes."

Abstract:
(1) Background: How variations of the push-up plus (PUP)-particularly changes in the base of support and scapular excursion-affect scapular muscle activation remains unclear. This study compared phase-specific electromyographic (EMG) activity of scapular muscles during four protraction-retraction exercises. (2) Methods: Twenty-six healthy male participants (age: 22.88 ± 1.45 years; height: 1.74 ± 0.05 m; weight: 77.31 ± 8.61 kg; body mass index (BMI): 25.61 ± 2.43 kg/m2) with Pilates experience performed four scapular protraction-retraction exercises under two base-of-support (quadruped vs. single-leg) and two movement-range (PUP vs. STD) conditions. Exercise order was randomized, and sufficient rest intervals were provided to minimize fatigue effects. Surface electromyography was recorded from six scapular muscles and normalized to maximal voluntary isometric contraction. The study was registered on CRIS (KCT0010032). (3) Results: Single-leg PUP showed the greatest serratus anterior (SA) activation, with increases of approximately 30% in protraction, 20-25% in isometric, and 15-20% in retraction. STD variations elicited higher trapezius activation, especially during large scapular excursions. The UT/SA ratio was significantly lower in PUP conditions (η2p = 0.544), reflecting a more favorable stabilization pattern. (4) Conclusions: This experimental repeated-measures study demonstrates that combining single-leg support with traditional PUP meaningfully increases SA recruitment across all phases, whereas increased scapular range enhances trapezius engagement. These findings provide novel phase-specific insights into how PUP variations modulate closed-chain scapular stabilization and may assist clinicians in selecting targeted exercises. Interpretation should be limited to trained healthy males."

Abstract:
We aim to evaluate the extent to which food fraud incidents cause food safety concerns, using three complementing sources: (1) the publicly available fraud issues as collected by the Joint Research Centre (JRC) of the European Union in monthly food fraud reports; (2) academic literature that documents food fraud incidents; and (3) reports of criminal investigations of food fraud in The Netherlands. We studied the nature of these concerns in terms of their severity, types of hazard and investigate this in relation to the type of food fraud as well as the types of product. The findings reveal that approximately one out of three cases of food fraud carries a considerable food safety risk. Within these cases, food laundering-(re)introducing already illegal food into the food chain-was the main type of fraud most predominant and carried most food safety risk. This study demonstrates how food frauds have further-reaching food safety consequences than meets the eye, impacting on the food safety system. Perpetrators, amongst other flaws, seem to consciously ignore food safety risks and regulations. The analytical research community could consider not focusing exclusively on fraudulent food enhancement, but also consider how to extend their contribution to the detection of food laundering."

Abstract:
Propolis is an apicultural product known for its antioxidant, antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory properties. However, its composition varies with botanical sources, geography, season and bee species, complicating quality control and creating opportunities for adulteration, such as the addition of poplar bud extracts or non-propolis resins. This review synthesizes the latest primary studies and reviews addressing chemical markers identified through analytical platforms, such as TLC, HPTLC, HPLC, LC-MS, GC-MS, NMR, FTIR and ICP, often integrated with chemometrics and machine learning for authentication and standardization. Marker panels are linked to regional chemotypes, including poplar-type, Brazilian green, red and brown, Cuban variants, and stingless bee propolis. Fraud detection strategies using marker-based screening and spectral pattern recognition are also summarized. Multi-marker and chemometric approaches consistently differentiate botanical types, origins and commercial extracts. Common marker families include flavonoids (pinocembrin, chrysin, galangin), phenolic esters (CAPE, benzyl/allyl caffeates), prenylated cinnamates like artepillin C, lignans, and volatile terpenoids or benzenoids. Rapid screening by ATR-FTIR and NMR is often complemented with LC-MS for confirmatory quantitation. Propolis quality control is moving toward harmonized workflows combining FTIR/NMR/HPTLC screening with LC-MS verification and optional elemental or volatile profiling, paving the way for shared marker sets and international standards similar to those for honey."

Abstract:
Geographical origin determination for seafood products is a fundamental aspect due to its implications for fraud prevention, ensuring food safety, and promoting resource sustainable management. In this research, different machine learning (ML) models based on random forests, support vector machines, and artificial neural networks were fed with trace element fingerprinting (TEF) and stable isotope ratio analysis (SIRA) to determine the origin of mussels that have been farmed in eight regions and ten locations around the world (areas of the European Atlantic coast, the Mediterranean Sea, and the Pacific coast of Chile). Fourteen trace elements in shells and carbon and nitrogen isotope ratios of mussel tissue were used singly, in combination, or reduced to develop the different approach models. All the selected models present high prediction accuracies for the independent variables (except for SIRA models), for their combination, or for their optimisation, highlighting the artificial neural network and random forest models that presented a 100% accuracy for all cases using a combination of variables selected based on a random forest model TEF to predict region and location, respectively. This fact confirms that ML models are suitable approximation techniques to determine the region and location of Mediterranean mussel origin, with key applications in food safety and global sustainability."

Abstract:
Background/Objectives: Specialized pro-resolving lipid mediators (SPMs), such as Resolvin E1 (RvE1) and Resolvin D1 (RvD1), play a critical role in the resolution phase of inflammation. However, their relevance to tendon pathology and tissue-specific degeneration in rotator cuff tears remains unclear. This study aimed to investigate the relation between serum RvE1 and RvD1 levels and the morphological severity of tendon retraction and muscle fatty degeneration in patients with full-thickness rotator cuff tears. Methods: A total of 70 participants were included: 35 patients with full-thickness rotator cuff tears determined by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and 35 healthy controls. Tendon retraction and muscle fatty degeneration were graded using Patte and Goutallier classifications, respectively. Serum RvE1 and RvD1 levels were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Group comparisons were performed using Welch's t-test, and correlations were analyzed with Spearman's coefficient. Results: RvE1 and RvD1 levels were significantly lower in patients compared to controls (p < 0.001). RvE1 showed a moderate positive correlation with Patte score (ρ = 0.37, p = 0.027), while no significant correlation was observed with Goutallier classification (ρ = 0.19, p = 0.27). RvD1 levels demonstrated no significant relationship with either morphological parameter. Conclusions: These findings suggest that decreased serum RvE1 levels are associated with the severity of tendon retraction but not with muscle fatty degeneration. Therefore, RvE1 may serve as a potential biochemical biomarker reflecting tendon damage severity and the impaired resolution of inflammation in rotator cuff tears."

Abstract:
Background: Cardiovascular diseases, driven by platelet hyperactivation and thrombosis, remain the leading global cause of death. Excessive platelet activation contributes to atherosclerosis and thrombo-inflammatory disorders, underscoring the urgent need for safer and more effective antiplatelet agents. Objectives:Xanthium strumarium L. (X. strumarium) has been reported to exhibit a wide range of pharmacological effects, including anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activities. However, its antiplatelet and antithrombotic effects remain unexplored. Therefore, the present study aimed to comprehensively evaluate the antiplatelet and antithrombotic effects of X. strumarium through integrated in vitro and in vivo experiments. Methods: The principal bioactive compounds present in the X. strumarium extract were identified through GC-MS analysis. In vitro antiplatelet effects were evaluated via light transmission aggregometry, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), ATP and calcium mobilization assays, αIIbβ3 binding assay, clot retraction assay, and Western blotting. In vivo ferric chloride-induced (FeCl3) murine thrombus model was established to evaluate thrombogenesis. Results: Our results demonstrated that X. strumarium at 25, 50, or 100 μg/mL significantly inhibited collagen, ADP, U46619, and thrombin-induced platelet aggregation. SEM revealed that X. strumarium pretreatment markedly preserved the resting platelet morphology and inhibited collagen-induced activation and shape changes. Further, the granule secretion, integrin-αIIbβ3 signaling, and the MAPK and PI3K/Akt pathways were also concentration-dependently inhibited. The in vivo blood flow rate and mice survival were improved, and H&E staining further revealed a concentration-dependent prevention of arterial occlusion following X. strumarium treatment. Conclusions: Collectively, X. strumarium demonstrated potent antiplatelet and antithrombotic effects, improving blood flow and survival while preventing arterial occlusion."

Abstract:
BACKGROUND: Understanding how unprofessionalism is interpreted and enacted in low- and middle-income countries is essential for developing health professionals that are contextually and socially grounded. The scoping review explores and maps existing scientific evidence on unprofessional behaviour in health professions education from a Global South perspective. The review was informed by the research question: How is unprofessional behaviour defined, conceptualised, and framed theoretically in health professions education within the Global South?
METHODS: Using a scoping review, we retrieved 382 articles, of which 14 articles were published between 2004 and 2024. The articles were retrieved across PubMed/MEDLINE, Scopus, Web of Science, EBSCOhost (Academic Search Complete, Health Source, and PsycINFO) databases, and supplemented by Google Scholar.
RESULTS: The studies emerged from 10 countries, with the majority conducted in the United Arab Emirates (21.4%), followed by Saudi Arabia and Thailand with 14.3% each, and other countries each contributing 7.1% of the total studies. The highest number of studies was published in 2017, 2020, and 2023 (14.3% each). Most study designs were cross-sectional (71.5%), while qualitative studies accounted for 21.4%, and mixed methods were 7.1%. The study populations predominantly consisted of medical students (64.4%), followed by residents (14.3%), and smaller groups including multi-disciplinary students (Medicine, Pharmacy, Nursing), clinicians and medical students, and clinical faculty members and medical students with 7.1% each. The studies were conducted across academic and clinical settings (50.0%), with others focusing solely on clinical environments (28.6%), preclinical settings (14.3%), and a clinical and surgical training environment (7.1%). Five key themes emerged: Academic Dishonesty and Integrity Violations, Bullying and Harassment, Clinical and Ethical Misconduct, Disrespect and Power Abuse, and Neglect of Professional Responsibilities.
CONCLUSIONS: The study findings draw attention to the need for theoretical engagement and institutional reforms that reflect the realities of educational and clinical training environments in low- and middle-income countries."

Abstract:
Anticipated reactions to stressful situations are vital for the survival and well-being of organisms, and abnormal reactions results in stress-related disorders. The neuropeptide oxytocin is a key modulator ensuring well-adapted stress responses. Oxytocin acts on both neurons and astrocytes, but the molecular and cellular mechanisms mediating stress response remain poorly understood. Here, we focus on the amygdala, a crucial hub that integrates and processes sensory information through oxytocin-dependent mechanisms. Using an acute stress paradigm in mice, genetic and pharmacological manipulations combined with proteomic, morphological, electrophysiological and behavioral approaches, we reveal that oxytocinergic modulation of the freezing response to stress is mediated by transient Gαi-dependent retraction of astrocytic processes, followed by enhanced neuronal sensitivity to extracellular potassium in the amygdala. Our findings elucidate a pivotal role for astrocytes morphology-dependent modulation of brain circuits that is required for proper anticipated behavioral response to stressful situations."

Abstract:
Developing resilient aqueous energy storage systems, such as Zn batteries, is essential for advancing energy sustainability. A key challenge in these systems is the dendritic growth of metals, which causes poor rechargeability in battery electrodes. Classical diffusion-limited dendritic growth is predicted to occur when the charging rate exceeds the limiting current density Jlim determined by electrolyte transport properties. Understanding the electrochemical behavior of dendrites is critical for designing fast-charging metal electrodes, where dendritic growth is not only likely but sometimes unavoidable due to uneven current distribution. Conventional wisdom suggests that high-aspect-ratio fractal dendrites are susceptible to bottom-initiated dissolution, leading to mechanical break-off from the current collector and the formation of ""dead"" metal. Surprisingly, our results show that near-unity charge-discharge reversibility can be achieved even with highly ramified classical diffusion-limited dendritic Zn metal structures. In particular, the reversibility improves with an increasing discharge rate, demonstrating a strong positive correlation. A two-orders-of-magnitude (∼200×) enhancement in cycle life is observed when Zn electrodes charged identically fast, but discharged at higher versus lower rates. Operando visualization reveals that dendrite fragmentation is significantly suppressed at higher discharge rates. Complementary post-mortem microstructural analysis shows that, consistent with predictions based on the Wagner number (Wa), high-rate discharges promote preferential tip-initiated stable retraction, whereas low-rate discharges induce ""pitting"" corrosion that mechanically weakens the dendrite backbone and promotes fragmentation. These findings challenge the prevailing assumption that dendritic growth necessarily limits the reversibility and offer new design principles for metal battery electrodes operating at unprecedented high rates approaching the diffusion limit."

Abstract:
OBJECTIVE: To assess the clinical effects of various rubber-dam retraction techniques on gingival health following anterior composite restorations.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Ninety-six restorations were performed on 24 patients. Each patient received four restorations on maxillary incisors, and each incisor was subjected to a different retraction technique under rubber-dam isolation randomly (#212 clamp, Brinker-B4 clamp, single-loop self-ligating tie, and self-ligating tie-#212 clamp combination). Assessment parameters included plaque index, bleeding, probing depth, keratinized and attached gingiva width, gingival margin level, and attachment level. All were measured initially, immediately after, at 1 week, 1 month, and 3 months. Shapiro-Wilk, Kruskal-Wallis, Mann-Whitney-U, and Friedman tests were used for statistical analyses (< 0.05).
RESULTS: Bleeding on probing was highest immediately after (p < 0.001). Attached keratinized gingiva decreased immediately after (p < 0.001), while relative gingival margin level significantly increased (p < 0.001). All parameters completely returned to baseline at 3 months recall (p ≥ 0.05). No significant differences were found among the retraction techniques (p ≥ 0.05) and between the thick and thin gingival phenotypes (p = 0.772).
CONCLUSIONS: Rubber-dam retraction may cause temporary adverse effects in gingival health immediately after the restorations, which can completely reverse in 3 months. Besides, different retraction techniques presented similar effects. Gingival phenotype was not an influential factor.
CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Rubber dam retraction techniques may provide adverse effects on gingival health, whereas this effect might be temporary. Proper application of the retraction material, the surface finishing technique, and the retraction period might be the key factors in this regard."

Abstract:
Late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD) is framed here as progressive astrocyte-neuronal metabolic and neurovascular uncoupling initiated by astrocytic bioenergetic collapse. In genetically or environmentally predisposed brains, a self-reinforcing loop of lipid accumulation, inflammation, vascular impairment, glucose-handling defects, and mitochondrial dysfunction erodes astrocytic functional capacity. Subsequent cerebrovascular dysfunction and loss of blood-brain barrier (BBB) integrity perpetuate the neuroinflammatory response and drive amyloid-β deposition. Astrocytic failure then disrupts astrocyte-neuron metabolic and neurovascular coupling, compromising lactate shuttling, glycogen mobilization, glutamate uptake, potassium buffering, antioxidant support, lipid handling, and demand-perfusion matching. Neurons deprived of this support enter chronic energy stress with sustained AMPK activation, which enhances tau hyperphosphorylation, perturbs proteostasis, and reduces tau O-GlcNAc protection, fostering pathological tau assembly. Amyloid-β deposits are enriched with heparan sulphate proteoglycans that provide a polyanionic scaffold which, together with persistent AMPK and inflammatory signaling, concentrates and misfolds tau into paired helical filaments. Tau-mediated mitochondrial injury further amplifies neuronal energy failure and feeds back via inflammatory pathways to worsen astrocytic dysfunction, closing the loop. Failure of the astrocyte-neuron lactate shuttle is identified as a key bridge between astrocytic and neuronal bioenergetic failure, where reduced lactate shuttling is proposed to impair long-term potentiation, thus accounting for the typical amnestic presentation of LOAD. Astrocytic bioenergetic load is predicted to peak in default-mode network hubs and other cortices with high resting aerobic glycolysis, reflecting reliance on astrocytic glycolysis for lactate shuttling and thereby accounting for the regional vulnerability observed in LOAD. This bioenergetic failure model integrates amyloid-β, tau, vascular, metabolic, and inflammatory findings into a single framework that accounts for genetic risk factors such as APOE and TREM2. Falsifiable temporal sequencing predictions for LOAD and specific forms of early-onset Alzheimer's disease are generated from the model."

Abstract:
BACKGROUND: This study aimed to evaluate the effect of external force applied from mini-screws to the aligner during space closure in extraction cases, and to determine the optimal loading conditions to prevent lingual crown tipping of the incisor and mesial tipping of the molar using the finite element (FE) method.
METHODOLOGY: A three-dimensional FE model of the maxillary dentition with extraction of first premolars was constructed, and three different loading conditions were designed. The aligner was activated for 0.25 mm of incisor retraction without using mini-screws, with application of 0, 100, 200, or 300 cN of distal force through mini-screws placed in the posterior region, or with application of 0, 100, 200, 300, or 400 cN of intrusive force through mini-screws placed in the anterior region, in addition to the application of 300 cN of distal force.
RESULTS: As the magnitude of distal force increased, the degree of mesial tipping of the first molar gradually decreased, becoming almost zero with nearly 300 cN of distal force. As the magnitude of intrusive force increased in addition to the application of 300 cN of distal force, the degree of lingual crown tipping of the central incisor gradually decreased, becoming almost zero with nearly 400 cN of intrusive force.
CONCLUSION: Application of 300 cN of distal force to the aligner from mini-screws placed in the posterior region could completely prevent mesial tipping of the molar and anchorage loss during anterior retraction. Application of 400 cN of intrusive force from mini-screws placed in the anterior region could prevent lingual crown tipping of the incisor, thus providing better torque control for the incisors."

Abstract:
BACKGROUND: Thyroid stimulating hormone, T3, T4, and thyroid auto-antibodies are essential in diagnosis of immune thyroiditis, Graves' and Hashimoto's. These, however, may not correlate with thyroid eye disease or TED. In recent years, a new blood test for thyroid stimulating immunoglobulins (TSI) is in use. However, there is no sufficient clinical evidence of their role in TED. The purpose of the current study is to evaluate the correlation between TSI and TED activity and to examine if TSI is a predictor for the severity of the disease.
METHODS: A retrospective analysis of electronic medical records of all patients who attended TED clinic at Sheba Medical Center, Israel between 2017 and 2022 and had at least one TSI sample was performed. Data included demographics, comprehensive ophthalmic examination, clinical activity scores (CASs), laboratory tests, and quality of life assessment by the Graves' Orbitopathy QOL questionnaire.
RESULTS: 60 patients with 43 females (72%) were included. TSI at presentation correlated with eyelid retraction, IOP (Pearson correlation, 0.369, P< =0.01), and CAS (Pearson correlation, 0.392, P = 0.029). TSI values >500% were found to be significantly correlated with the use of medical treatment including high-dose steroids (P = 0.05), steroid treatment according to the European Group on Graves' Orbitopathy protocol (P = 0.02), and radioactive iodine (P = 0.03). Moreover, it was also significantly correlated with surgical procedures including decompression (P = 0.016) and strabismus surgeries (P = 0.024).
CONCLUSIONS: TSI is correlated with more severe clinical presentation and higher likelihood of medical or surgical treatment. Therefore, TSI can be considered as a predictor factor for the disease. Routing testing for TSI may be warranted for all TED patients."

Abstract:
Entangled polymer melts undergo a transient stress undershoot, following the well-known overshoot, during shear startup, as established with several experiments using primarily nearly monodisperse linear polystyrenes (PS) and their mutual blends of different molar mass. While the microscopic origin of the undershoot remains debated, growing evidence supports a connection to chain tumbling, as proposed by [Costanzo, S. Macromolecules 2016, 49(10), 3925-3935.] through their tumbling-enabling Ianniruberto-Marrucci (IM) model and further supported by simulations and other modeling approaches. The current view is that undershoots reflect the cyclic orientation-retraction dynamics of chains with the initial chain orientation state playing a decisive role. Here, we investigate both overshoot and undershoot behavior systematically across a series of PS melts across the unentangled-entangled transition (with the average number of entanglements ranging from 1.8 to 16.7) using a modular cone-partitioned-plate (CPP) geometry, and compare the experimental data with the tumbling-enabling Ianniruberto-Marrucci (IM) model. Subsequently, repeated shear startup protocols with increasing rest (annealing) times between sequential tests were applied to probe the undershoot evolution. Our results demonstrate that undershoots re-emerge only after unexpectedly long annealing times at sufficiently large shear rates (WiR ≥ 10), highlighting persistent structural memory effects. These findings provide new insights on how segmental reorientation affects the undershoot recovery of sheared polymer melts and contributes toward assessing and improving the constitutive description of nonlinear polymer dynamics."

Abstract:
Purpose: To describe a case of upper eyelid retraction secondary to previous superior recti recessions in association with stretched scars. Case Report: A 26-year-old female patient presented with upper eyelid retraction and exotropia for four years. She had undergone bilateral medial and superior rectus recessions for the treatment of esotropia and dissociated vertical deviation five years earlier at another institution. The patient was otherwise healthy, and an evaluation for thyroid eye disease was negative. During surgery, stretched scars were found in both superior recti and the left medial rectus. The scarred segments were excised, and the muscles were reattached to the sclera using 6-0 polyglactin sutures. One year postoperatively, the patient was orthotropic and had no upper eyelid retraction. Discussion: Stretched scars, characterized by elongated muscular insertions, are a known cause of secondary strabismus and are thought to be associated with wound healing issues. Although they are a common cause of consecutive exotropia following medial rectus recessions, there are only a few reports of stretched scars in recessed superior rectus muscles in the literature. We report the case of eyelid retraction secondary to previous superior recti recessions in which the development of stretched scars might have played a role in the occurrence of the retraction."

Abstract:
Acute bronchiolitis is the most common viral lower respiratory tract infection in infants, with an annual incidence of 3-5% in children under 12 months, peaking between 2 and 6 months of age. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is responsible for 50-80% of cases. Although generally benign, bronchiolitis may be complicated by spontaneous pneumothorax, which is reported in only 0.5-2% of hospitalized infants, making it a rare but potentially life-threatening event. We report the case of an 11-month-old female infant with a family history of maternal asthma, admitted for acute respiratory distress during a second episode of bronchiolitis. Examination revealed tachypnea, wheezing, and retractions. RSV infection was confirmed by polymerase chain reaction. Imaging showed a moderate left-sided pneumothorax with partial atelectasis. Conservative management with oxygen, nebulized salbutamol, and intravenous corticosteroids led to full recovery without invasive intervention. This rare case emphasizes the importance of considering pneumothorax in bronchiolitis with sudden deterioration. In stable infants, conservative treatment may be sufficient."

Abstract:
Following the publication of the above paper, a concerned reader drew to the Editor's attention that, in Fig. 6, the same data appeared to have been included in three of the flow cytometric plots featured in this figure (for the Non‑treated, Scrambled and SiRNAi BIK experiments). Moreover, the control β‑actin western blots in Figs. 2B, 4A and 8B appeared to be the same (although, in these cases, the lanes for the blots were labelled up identically, and so these apparent duplications may not have represented an incorrect assembly of these figures); similarly, the control blots in Fig. 7A and B were also matching. However, the control β‑actin western blots in three other figure parts (Fig. 1C and 7A/B) were also duplicated, and in this case, the numbers of lanes in the gel slices were different / the lanes were labelled differently. The authors were contacted by the Editorial Office to offer an explanation for these potential anomalies in the presentation of the data in this paper, although up to this time, no response from them has been forthcoming. Owing to the fact that the Editorial Office has been made aware of potential issues surrounding the scientific integrity of this paper, the Editor of International Journal of Oncology has decided that this paper should be retracted from the Journal on account of a lack of confidence in the presented data.

Abstract:
BACKGROUND: Orthodontically induced root resorption (RR) is a frequent adverse effect that may compromise long-term tooth stability. Physical adjunctive interventions (PAIs), such as vibration, photobiomodulation, low-intensity pulsed ultrasound (LIPUS), and low-intensity electrical stimulation (LIES), have been proposed to accelerate tooth movement while potentially minimizing RR, but their efficacy remains unclear.
OBJECTIVE: To systematically evaluate the effect of PAIs on RR during orthodontic treatment based on evidence from randomized controlled trials (RCTs).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Databases included PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, Embase, and CENTRAL up to May 2025, supplemented by Google Scholar, TRIP, OpenGrey, PQDT Open, and hand-searching of orthodontic journals. No restrictions were applied on language or publication status. Eligibility included human randomized controlled trials comparing non-surgical physical adjunctive interventions with conventional orthodontic treatment and reporting quantitative orthodontically induced root resorption. Two reviewers independently performed screening, data extraction, and RoB 2 assessment; RR harms were evaluated with a modified McHarm tool, and certainty was appraised using the GRADE approach. Meta-analysis was conducted when appropriate. PROSPERO registration CRD420251116993.
RESULTS: Twenty-two RCTs (n=534) were included. Evidence certainty was low to very low. Vibration and LIES showed no significant effect. LIPUS reduced root length loss during canine retraction by 0.015mm/week (P=0.042) and premolar volume loss by 0.53mm3 (P<0.001). LED trays lowered premolar volume loss by 0.15mm3 (P<0.001). Laser therapy reduced RR scores during En-masse retraction (P<0.05). None of the PAIs increased RR compared with controls.
CONCLUSIONS: PAIs exhibit variable influence on RR. LIPUS and daily LED phototherapy show the most promising protective effects; however, current evidence remains limited by methodological weaknesses, small sample sizes, and short follow-up periods. Further well-designed RCTs are needed before widespread clinical adoption. PROSPERO (Registration ID: CRD420251116993)."

Abstract:
BACKGROUND: The conventional management of long gap oesophageal atresia (LGOA) typically involves the insertion of a gastrostomy shortly after birth. This is our experience with laparoscopic gastrostomy tube (LGt) insertion in newborns diagnosed with LGOA.
METHODS: A retrospective review of medical records for cases of LGOA that underwent laparoscopic-assisted Seldinger gastrostomy placement between 2019 and 2024. A 5 mm camera and 3 mm instruments were used to place transabdominal sutures to the stomach, which was then punctured with a needle and insufflated with 2 ml of air. A Seldinger wire and dilators were then used to insert a balloon gastrostomy tube. The sutures were tied extra-corporeally.
RESULTS: Eight newborns with LGOA underwent LGt (median gestation 36.5 weeks, age 2 days, birth weight 2.2 kg. Seven neonates were fitted with a 12Fr gastrostomy tube, while one premature infant (33-week gestation, 1.4 kg) had an 8Fr Foley catheter. A contrast study was performed the following day to confirm the correct position of the feeding tube, and feeding was initiated after 24 h. There were no immediate complications or instances of tube displacement observed. Ultimately, all patients successfully underwent staged thoracoscopic repair of their LGOA using external traction sutures.
CONCLUSIONS: The insertion of LGt proved to be safe, in our series despite the tiny size of their stomachs. This minimally invasive approach offers several advantages, including excellent visualization, reduced liver retraction, and less manipulation of the stomach. Additionally, it may lead to fewer adhesions, which is an important factor to consider since many patients with LGOA will require fundoplication in the future."

Abstract:
OBJECTIVES: Retractions of scientific articles have increased over time, across different health fields, disease indications, and study designs. However, it is currently unknown whether, and to what extent, retractions have impacted the literature of health economic evaluations. This research aimed to identify retracted health economic evaluations, describe the characteristics of such studies, and analyse reasons for retraction.
METHODS: We conducted a systematic review of health economic evaluations published in peer-reviewed journals and subsequently retracted, identified using MEDLINE, Embase, and the Retraction Watch database from inception to May 2025. Retraction notices were examined and publication details, including reasons for retraction, were extracted.
RESULTS: We identified 17 retracted economic evaluations published from 2006 to 2024. Studies evaluated a range of interventions in a broad array of disease indications. Retracted economic evaluations were published in 17 unique journals, 11 of which were top-tier outlets. Errors were the most common reason for retraction (11/17 studies, 64%), including errors in inputs, analysis, and/or model structure. Evidence of misconduct (plagiarism, duplicate publication, and peer-review manipulation) was found in 4/17 studies (24%). Retractions were rapid, with 12/17 studies (71%) retracted within the same year. Mean citation count was 4.8; the highest was 33. Despite retraction, studies were included in subsequent evidence reviews (6/17 studies, 35%) and one was used to inform clinical practice recommendations (1/17 studies, 6%).
CONCLUSION: Evidence for retractions of health economic evaluations was found, spanning a variety of disease indications, interventions, and journal sources, due to errors or scientific misconduct. In some cases, papers produced subsequent citations in the literature despite retraction.

Abstract:
This study aimed to evaluate the effects of orbitotomy on tuberculum sellae meningioma surgery using the supraorbital approach through a quantitative assessment of brain retraction and stratified effect by tumor size. An in-silico study was conducted using three-dimensional (3D) head models generated from the imaging data of 35 patients (70 hemispheres) without brain deformation, created with a surgical simulation software (GRID, Kompath Inc., Tokyo, Japan). A skull base tumor model was created by inserting virtual hemispherical tumors of varying diameters (20, 30, 40, and 50 mm) into the tuberculum sellae within the 3D model. Supraorbital craniotomy was performed on the skull base tumor model, and the distance of frontal lobe retraction required to access the tumor apex was measured with and without orbitotomy. Imaging data from 35 patients (70 hemispheres) revealed that orbitotomy statistically reduced frontal lobe retraction by 0.8 mm for 20 mm tumors, 1.55 mm for 30 mm tumors, 2.8 mm for 40 mm tumors, and 3.31 mm for 50 mm tumors (p < 0.01 for all findings). A comparison of the effects of orbitotomy according to tumor size showed the highest impact on tumors larger than 40 mm. This study quantified changes in brain retraction associated with adding orbitotomy for tumors of various sizes. These findings provide specific estimates for each tumor size, serving as a guideline for determining the indications for orbitotomy and contributing to optimizing skull base surgical approaches."

Abstract:
There is growing evidence that sexual victimization is a robust predictor of delinquency among girls. Histories of trauma and victimization are closely tied to emotional and behavioral dysregulation, which may lead juvenile justice personnel to perceive affected girls as aggressive or antisocial. These perceptions can, in turn, influence processing decisions and outcomes within the juvenile justice system. Despite this, limited attention has been paid to how probation officers' gender might shape their assessments of girls with sexual victimization histories. In particular, prior research suggests that male juvenile justice professionals may be hesitant to work with justice-involved girls due to concerns about potential allegations of misconduct. However, it remains unclear whether such concerns result in biased assessments of risk-especially when girls have previously disclosed sexual victimization. This study addresses this gap by examining whether the gender of juvenile probation officers moderates the relationship between girls' sexual victimization histories and their scores on the personality subdomain of the Youth Level of Service (YLS) risk assessment. Using administrative data from all girls entering a Midwestern juvenile court between January 2015 and October 2023 (N = 252), we find no statistically significant main effect of sexual victimization on YLS personality scores. However, a non-significant, yet consistent pattern emerged: male probation officers rated girls who reported sexual victimization as having more severe personality-related concerns compared to their non-victimized counterparts. These findings underscore the importance of considering officer gender in juvenile justice assessments and raise critical questions about how victimization is interpreted in risk evaluations."

Abstract:
Extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) is highly ranked in the global market, recognized for its several health benefits. However, due to its high commercial value it is often adulterated with cheaper oils. This study presents a novel, chromatography-free method for EVOO authentication using Direct Analysis in Real Time coupled to Quadrupole-Time-of-Flight Mass Spectrometry (DART-QTOF MS). Method optimization was carried out using a design of experiments approach, highlighting gas temperature and valve rotation as key parameters. Optimizing these conditions led to a significant increase in signal intensity. Eighty authentic oils from ten categories were analyzed. Multivariate statistical analysis revealed clear discrimination of EVOO from other oils and enabled detection of EVOO adulteration down to 1 % with vegetable oils and 5 % with lower-quality olive oils. Key authenticity markers, including phenols, squalene, and triacylglycerols (TAGs), were identified. The proposed method demonstrates high potential for rapid, reliable EVOO authentication in routine quality control."

Abstract:
BACKGROUND: Few studies have taken a broad perspective on substandard and falsified medicines (SFMs) in community settings in Uganda. We therefore qualitatively assessed the perceptions and practices on SFMs for humans and animals in Wakiso District, Uganda.
METHODS: This qualitative study employed 12 focus group discussions among community health workers and farmers, as well as 11 key informant interviews among health professionals, local leaders, veterinary and human drug shop operators, and Ministry of Health and Ministry of Agriculture, Animal Industry and Fisheries officials. Data was analysed thematically using NVivo (2020).
RESULTS: Findings are presented under four themes: definition of SFMs; identification of SFMs; drivers of SFMs; and challenges in reporting SFMs. Although participants felt that the term SFMs was too broad to define, many explained it in relation to consequences (such as side effects, disabilities, and death), and the different methods that may be employed to identify SFMs. SFMs were said to be identified through changes in appearance such as colour, texture and packaging. However, the most reported way of identifying SFMs was based on negative effects on humans and animals after use. Customer drivers of SFMs included inadequate knowledge, lack of finances, and lack of access to licensed drug shops/ pharmacies. Supplier drivers of SFMs included limited regulation and enforcement, and the business orientation of drug shops/ pharmacies. Lack of knowledge of how to report suspected cases of SFMs, lack of proof of purchase of SFMs, fear of reporting, and lack of trust in government procedures were the challenges identified to reporting SFMs.
CONCLUSION: Several drivers of SFMs in the community were established related to individuals, sources of medicine, and regulatory frameworks. Increased awareness on SFMs, improved traceability of purchases and reporting, and better enforcement of regulations are needed to reduce the use and risks associated with SFMs to protect public health."

Abstract:
Study DesignProspective Cohort Study of 108 cases.ObjectiveProne Transpsoas (PTP) fusion is a minimally invasive surgical technique using a single-position prone lateral approach to augment the anterior column of the lumbar spine. Degenerative spondylolisthesis (DS) is a common pathology where anterior-posterior access can be advantageous. This study aimed to evaluate operative, radiological and functional outcomes of PTP fusion in the management of symptomatic DS.MethodsA multi-centre cohort study was conducted, involving 108 consecutive patients who underwent PTP fusion for low-grade (Grade I-II) DS. Descriptive statistical analysis was used to evaluate clinical, radiological and functional outcomes.ResultsIn all 108 cases, anterior column fusion was combined with posterior percutaneous pedicle screw fixation to optimise spinal realignment. The cohort's average operative time was 115 minutes, and the psoas retraction time was 14 minutes. The cohort had an average slip of 5.9 mm, which was reduced to 0.8 mm (P < 0.001) postoperatively. Statistically significant radiological improvements were observed in lumbar lordosis (Δ5°), segmental lordosis (Δ4°), anterior disc height (Δ 4.2 mm) and posterior disc height (Δ 2.1 mm). No major vascular or visceral complications were encountered. The sustained neurological complication rate was 1.9%, and patients maintained improved functional outcomes through the 1-year follow-up.ConclusionsPTP is a safe approach for managing low-grade DS, showing significant postoperative correction of spinal alignment. These results support the use of PTP fusion for treating spondylolisthesis and add to the growing evidence of its safety and efficacy as a minimally invasive technique."

Abstract:
Biology textbooks lack precise terms to describe oxygen-based inter-organismal signaling between oxygen-producing and aerobic organisms. To address this gap, I recently proposed the concept of gasocrine signaling, which encompasses all signaling mediated by gaseous molecules and gasoreceptors within and between cells, organisms, and even abiotic factors. Given the fundamental importance of gaseous molecules for life, I propose the gasocrine hypothesis: all cells require gasocrine signaling. This hypothesis can be divided into three sub-hypotheses: First, all living organisms composed of one or more cells require gasocrine signaling to sense, communicate, grow, and propagate. Second, gasocrine signaling mediated via gasoreceptor proteins (or yet to be identified gas-sensing riboceptors) is the most essential cellular and inter-organismal signaling. Third, acellular entities arising from or replicating in pre-existing cells require gasocrine signaling. I propose several potential experiments to falsify these hypotheses. If they withstand falsification, the gasocrine hypothesis would supplement cell theory. It would also provide a novel framework for understanding fundamental biological principles, cellular and organismal communication, and the role of abiotic factors. Furthermore, it establishes the foundation for the emerging field of gasocrinology, which is critical in the context of a changing environment."

Abstract:
Quadriceps tendon ruptures (QTRs) are uncommon injuries that can become challenging to manage when diagnosis is delayed and significant tendon retraction and scarring occur. In chronic cases with significant tendon defects, primary repair is often not feasible, and reconstruction with graft augmentation becomes necessary. Achilles tendon allografts are commonly used in such scenarios; however, obtaining reliable graft incorporation and stable load-sharing remains difficult in patients with large defects, poor tendon quality, or elevated mechanical demand. This report describes a novel dual-layer Achilles tendon allograft reconstruction, referred to as the Dual-Achilles Reconstruction for Chronic Quadriceps Rupture (DARC) technique. This technique is designed to maximize circumferential graft contact, restore tendon bulk, and improve load distribution in a chronic QTR with significant retraction. A 56-year-old man with a body mass index (BMI) of 42.2 presented six weeks after two mechanical falls with persistent pain, recurrent buckling, and loss of active knee extension. Examination revealed a palpable suprapatellar defect, patella baja, and complete extensor mechanism failure. Radiographs demonstrated a Caton-Deschamps index of 0.56, and magnetic resonance imaging confirmed a full-thickness QTR with approximately 8 cm of proximal retraction and a 7 mm hematoma. Because of the chronicity of the injury and poor-quality tendon tissue, primary repair was not suitable. Reconstruction was performed using two Achilles tendon allografts anchored to the medial and lateral thirds of the superior patellar pole, which were then passed through the quadriceps muscle belly. The grafts were circumferentially wrapped around the tendon stump to create an anterior-posterior dual-layer construct intended to enhance graft integration and biomechanical stability. The patient followed a structured rehabilitation protocol. The patient regained full knee extension without extensor lag, achieved 0-120° of flexion, normalized gait by 12 weeks, and returned to unrestricted activity by one year. This favorable recovery is notable given the chronic nature of the rupture, the 8 cm retraction, and the patient's high BMI, all of which typically predict poorer outcomes. This case suggests that dual-layer Achilles tendon allograft reconstruction may offer a viable and structurally robust alternative for chronic QTRs with significant tissue loss where direct repair or single-graft techniques may be insufficient."

Abstract:
INTRODUCTION: Although WeChat is widely adopted in Chinese higher-education English-translation programmes, little is known about how students actually use its group-chat function for collaborative learning or what problems arise. This study explores the dual-group phenomenon-parallel instructor including inclusive and student-only WeChat groups, to uncover both the merits and the challenges of this informal digital ecology.
METHODS: An interpretivist, qualitative design was employed. Twenty-eight undergraduates from a Chinese technology-focused public university were recruited through course announcements, email and flyers. Semi-structured, face-to-face interviews were conducted, transcribed, translated and analysed inductively using thematic analysis.
RESULTS: All participants reported maintaining two distinct WeChat groups per course: (1) an authoritative, instructor-inclusive channel for official notices and verified resources; and (2) an informal, student-only space for peer troubleshooting, social support and rapid resource sharing. Benefits included clear role differentiation, emotional safety for ""naïve"" questions, and accelerated knowledge co-construction. Downsides were information overload, off-topic chatter, fragmented communication, unequal participation dominated by vocal peers, and limited instructor oversight. Half of the informants observed instances of academic misconduct (e.g., sharing quiz screenshots or copying translations). Students also noted blurred professional boundaries, with some expecting 24/7 instructor availability.
DISCUSSION: The dual-group arrangement constitutes a layered communication ecology that simultaneously enhances and undermines collaborative learning. While it balances authority with autonomy, its unregulated nature risks cognitive overload, inequity and integrity breaches. Examples of pedagogical recommendations include: (a) explicit norms for each group, (b) weekly pinned summaries to reduce noise, (c) peer moderators to ensure equitable voice, (d) assessment designs that deter cheating, and (e) co-created digital-communication codes to clarify collaboration-plagiarism boundaries. Institutionally, embedding digital professionalism into curriculum standards and establishing discipline-level hubs for digital-translation pedagogy can better achieve university learning goals."

Abstract:
This paper predicts that humans will venture into space and that, to survive and thrive in space, we will need to enhance our capacities radically. Moderate enhancement is insufficient for a humanity that commits to a future in Space. The paper is a partial retraction of the author's claims about the morality and prudential rationality of radical human enhancement. It allows that radical enhancement may be imprudent and immoral for Earth-bound humans, but essential for humans who settle in space. The paper advances a conjecture about how to assess which kinds of radical enhancements are required and which should be rejected. A humanity that commits to a future in Space may make progress on some disputes that today seem intractable."

Abstract:
This explorative empirical study examined patterns of repeated severe prison violence within a cohort of 350 detainees admitted to the Dutch high-security ""Violence Facility"" for uncontrollably violent detainees, aiming to identify detainee characteristics predicting severe prison violence recidivism. Data were derived from judicial reports, imprisonment registrations, and criminal records. Proportional hazards regressions were used to assess prison violence recidivism risk up to 7.5 years post-discharge by examining detainee factors related to crime history, psychopathological diagnoses, and historical and clinical violence-related risk factors. Almost 30% of detainees were re-admitted to the Violence Facility, indicating recurrent severe prison violence. A pattern of rebelliousness and non-compliance emerged as a pre-existing and persistent trait. Additionally significant were recent social functioning, treatment motivation, and daytime activity engagement in predicting prison violence recidivism. Findings enhance understanding of the persistence and predictors of prison violence, yielding implications for risk management and violence prevention in correctional settings."

Abstract:
Customs revenue represents a major source of funding for most governments. Accordingly, customs administrations worldwide have promoted advanced analytics techniques to detect fraud and enhance revenue collection. However, inspecting imported commodities and auditing tax declarations is time-consuming, costly, and dependent on the inspector's expertise. Consequently, machine learning-based solutions have become critical for identifying fraud and minimizing revenue at risk. This paper applies the Dual-learning XGBoost-Based Approach (DXGBA) to the customs fraud detection domain. It demonstrates its ability to jointly detect fraud and estimate the corresponding revenue impact within a single boosting framework. The problem of under-valued imports is formulated as a dual supervised learning task, where DXGBA performs simultaneous classification and regression via a joint objective. The model ranks declarations based on their predicted revenue risk. Based on this ranking, it supports decision-makers in prioritizing inspections and enables maximizing revenue recovery under limited auditing capacity. To alleviate class imbalance, resampling strategies including the Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) and Random Undersampling (RU) were investigated. DXGBA classifies declarations as ""fraudulent"" or ""non-fraudulent"" and estimates the revenue at risk. Comparative experiments on a benchmark customs dataset show the high performance of DXGBA over single-task and state-of-the-art baselines. Results indicate that DXGBA recovers up to 87.98% of revenue by auditing only 10% of declarations. Furthermore, two enhancement pipelines, including tree-based embeddings and autoencoder-based deep feature representations, were examined. They both yield further gains in accuracy and revenue estimation performance."

Abstract:
INTRODUCTION: Extractions may be helpful in the relief of crowding and in incisal retraction. While extractions may help to control the vertical dimension, their effect is not clear-cut. Four premolar extractions (FPE) may be more potent in reducing the vertical dimension than two upper premolar extractions (UPE), although research to support this contention is lacking.
OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of orthodontic extraction protocols on vertical skeletal relationships.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: A retrospective study involving participants either undergoing UPE or FPE-based treatment and non-extraction-based controls was performed. All cephalometric outcome measures were assessed before (T0) and after (T1) orthodontic treatment. The effect of extraction pattern on vertical skeletal dimension in terms of mandibular planes angle (MMPA) and anterior facial height (AFH) was assessed using a multivariable analysis.
RESULTS: A total of 168 patients (86 males, 82 females) with a mean age of 13.69±5.03years were included. The MMPA reduced marginally in all three groups. Based on multivariable analysis adjusted for age, lower crowding at baseline, sex, and MMPA at baseline, the extraction pattern did not exert a significant effect on post-treatment MMPA (UPE group: coef.=-0.31; 95% CI: -1.06, 0.43, P=0.40; FPE group: coef.=-0.40; 95% CI: -1.75, 0.96; P=0.56) compared to non-extraction protocols. Similarly, the extraction pattern did not have a significant effect on post-treatment AFH (UPE group: coef.=0.50; 95% CI: -0.73, 1.73, P=0.42; FPE group: coef.=1.59; 95% CI: -0.65, 3.83; P=0.16).
CONCLUSIONS: Based on the findings of the present retrospective study, neither statistically nor clinically significant differences in the vertical skeletal relationships were introduced across UPE, FPE, and non-extraction groups. Post-treatment MMPA and AFH were significantly associated solely with their pre-treatment values."

Abstract:
Antimicrobial resistance is a growing global health crisis, with ESKAPE pathogens, such as Acinetobacter species, contributing significantly to hospital-acquired infections. These bacteria employ various virulence factors, including extracellular type IV pili (T4P), which serve as essential appendages for DNA uptake, biofilm formation, and resistance to antibiotics. Single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) bacteriophages (phages) exploit these retractile pili as entry receptors, but the exact mechanism of viral RNA delivery following pilus binding and retraction remains poorly understood. In this study, we investigated the entry mechanism of the ssRNA phage AP205 by identifying the specific phage components necessary for T4P detachment, a key step in viral genome entry. Our data reveals the phage's maturation protein (Mat) is sufficient to induce pilus detachment on its own, and the overall virion structure further enhances the efficiency of this process. These findings provide mechanistic insights into how ssRNA phages exploit bacterial T4P as part of their infection pathway and suggest a conserved strategy for host entry."

Abstract:
OBJECTIVES: To validate the third palatal rugae as stable reference landmarks for the superimposition of maxillary digital models in premolar extraction cases.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Maxillary intraoral scanning digital models of 22 extraction patients, obtained before (T0) and after approximately 4 months of incisor retraction (T1), were superimposed using the automated best-fit of the third palatal rugae and palatine raphe. Voxel-based registration of CBCT scans served as the gold standard. Point-to-point displacements between T0 and T1 of the central incisors and cuspids were calculated for both methods.
RESULTS: The mean differences (mismatch) between methods in the combined vertical and horizontal perspectives of the central incisors were 0.08 mm (right) and 0.12 mm (left), respectively. For the cuspids, the mean 2D differences were 0.02 mm (right) and 0.07 mm (left). The pure horizontal displacement differences of the maxillary central incisors were 0.13 mm (right) and 0.04 mm (left). For the cuspids, the differences were: 0.05 mm (right) and 0.03 mm (left). No statistically significant differences were found between the intraoral-scan and CBCT measurements for either the central incisors or cuspids after maxillary superimpositions. The differences between the two methods were smaller than 0.2 mm in all comparisons.
CONCLUSIONS: Digital superimposition of the third palatal rugae of models obtained with intraoral scans is a valid method for the 3D evaluation of the short-term (4-month) dental changes in the anterior region of the maxilla in cases of premolar extraction followed by incisor retraction.

Abstract:
Retractions issued for misconduct offer a unique window into how questionable research is rhetorically constructed and made to appear credible. This study investigates how engaging with retracted articles can serve as a pedagogical tool for reviewer training, with particular attention to the rhetorical mechanisms through which unreliability is performed. Twenty STEM doctoral researchers analyzed self-selected retracted papers using guided critical-reading questions to identify problematic rhetorical features. Across the analyses, five recurring issues emerged: intertextual falsification, methodological opacity, rhetorical inconsistency, rhetorical overstatement, and terminological distortion. The findings indicate that this approach has the potential to raise doctoral students' rhetorical sensitivity by enabling them to detect subtle markers of unreliability and to adopt a more evaluative rhetorical stance toward scholarly texts. Retracted articles thus can provide an authentic pedagogical resource for developing reviewer rhetorical sensitivity within doctoral education."

Abstract:
BACKGROUND: The advancement of single-port laparoscopic cholecystectomy (SPLC) in primary hospitals in China continues to be impeded by formidable technical obstacles, including insufficient triangular relationships and suboptimal ergonomics. Therefore, a novel magnetically controlled separable forceps system was developed to improve the performance of SPLC. The objective of this study was to provide a comprehensive account of the initial experience with the separable magnetically-controlled forceps system.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Animals Experiments and a 52-year-old male (body mass index, 21.82) presented by the authors. Underwent a pure SPLC procedure using a subumbilical approach without additional trocars or sutures. The surgical procedure was facilitated using a novel separable magnetically controlled forceps system, that improved the surgical field of vision during dissection with less instrument coming from and being controlled from the same port of entry.
RESULTS: No adverse events occurred during the animal experiments. Meanwhile, the procedure on the human body was completed within 45 min. Notably, there were no recorded instances of pre- or postoperative complications, and the use of postoperative drains was unnecessary. Furthermore, the patient was discharged 8 h after the surgical intervention, and subsequent follow-up was uneventful for 30 days postoperatively.
CONCLUSION: This innovative magnet-retracting forceps system allows portless access to the peritoneal cavity, providing surgeons with superior endoscopic views and the ease of maneuverability of retraction. The feasibility and safety of utilizing the novel separable magnetically controlled forceps for gallbladder retraction have been demonstrated using SPLC."

Abstract:
Immunothrombosis can substantially affect the course and outcomes of severe infections and immune-mediated diseases. While inflammatory thrombi are neutrophil-rich, impact of neutrophils on clot contraction, a key modulator of thrombus stability and obstructiveness, was unknown. This study investigated how neutrophils and neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) affect the rate and extent of platelet-driven clot contraction. Isolated human neutrophils were stimulated with phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate (PMA) to induce NETosis, confirmed by fluorescence microscopy and scanning electron microscopy. Thrombin-induced clots, formed from whole blood or platelet-rich plasma, were supplemented with non-activated or PMA-activated neutrophils. Clot contraction kinetics and viscoelasticity were analyzed. PMA-activated neutrophils significantly enhanced the rate and final extent of clot contraction compared to controls. This promoting effect was abolished by deoxyribonuclease (DNAse) I, confirming that it was mediated by NETs embedded in the fibrin network. The factor Xa inhibitor rivaroxaban also abrogated this effect, indicating a role for NET-induced endogenous thrombin generation and platelet hyperactivation. Thromboelastography revealed that NETs made clots softer and more deformable. We conclude that activated neutrophils promote clot contraction via NETs embedded in the fibrin network, which enhance platelet contractility via endogenous thrombin production and increase clot deformability, suggesting that inflammatory thrombosis may require treatments addressing this enhanced contractility."

Abstract:
OBJECTIVE: Evaluate corneal sensitivity as a potential pathway for blue light-induced ocular discomfort.
DESIGN: Cross-sectional study.
SUBJECTS: Healthy adult volunteers without previous ocular medical history.
METHODS: Subjects were exposed to a Hue A19 LED bulb calibrated for equivalent photo flux for 450 nm (blue) and 620 nm (red) wavelengths. Corneal sensitivity measurements via a 0.12-mm filament Cochet-Bonet esthesiometer were ascertained after 1 minute of exposure and throughout testing. The order of exposed wavelength was randomized, with a 5-minute rest interval between exposure to each wavelength of light.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Cochet-Bonnet measurements of (1) threshold to sensation, (2) discrimination, and (3) threshold to pain. Threshold to sensation was determined by the longest filament length at which the subject noted consistent initial sensation. Discrimination was determined by changing the filament length by 5-mm increments (both retraction and extension) until the subject was able to correctly and consistently distinguish less, greater, or equal sensation compared with the previous application. Threshold to pain was determined at the filament length at which the participant expressed pain or discomfort.
RESULTS: There was no difference in threshold to sensation between blue (450 nm) and red (620 nm) light sources (P ≥ 0.99). There was no statistically significant difference in discrimination of stimuli under blue- or red-light exposure (P = 0.30), although blue-light exposure trended to be more sensitive. The threshold to pain under blue light was statistically significantly lower than in red-light conditions, with pain at a longer filament length under blue-light exposure compared with red-light exposure (median 12.5 mm vs. 7.5 mm, respectively; P = 0.03).
CONCLUSIONS: Blue- versus red-light exposure decreases subjective corneal pain threshold when measured by the Cochet-Bonnet esthesiometer. Altered corneal sensitivity may mediate blue light-induced ocular discomfort. The Cochet-Bonnet esthesiometer is a useful tool in the study of blue light-induced discomfort.

CASE PRESENTATION: We present the case of a 62-year-old male with emphysema and progressive dyspnoea, whose chest radiographs revealed indirect signs of left lower lobe (LLL) collapse, including a reduced left hilar silhouette, elevated left hemidiaphragm, right lung herniation, and mediastinal shift. These findings were confirmed by CT imaging, which demonstrated retraction of the LLL along the spine, which is an appearance not easily detectable on standard radiographs.
DISCUSSION: Chronic LLL collapse may be obscured due to reduced lobe volume and compensatory changes in surrounding structures. However, displacement and the apparent absence of the left hilum, in the absence of consolidation, can be a secondary sign of chronic LLL collapse. As such it should be taken in conjunction with other secondary signs of lobar collapse to suggest a possible diagnosis and prompt further confirmatory imaging.
CONCLUSION: Awareness of imaging patterns of lobar collapse, such as the apparent absence of a hilum, is essential for accurate interpretation, particularly in patients without prior lobectomy and when direct signs of consolidation are lacking."

Abstract:
Cardiothoracic surgery is one of the most gender-imbalanced specialties, with women representing less than 10% of the workforce worldwide. Despite a notable increase in recruitment and certification into the specialty in recent years, the disproportion is still notable and there is no expectation for that gap to be reduced in the next decades. Women in cardiothoracic surgery experience unique challenges such as inherited bias, discrimination, sexual misconduct, and extreme imbalance in work-life balance, especially around pregnancy and childcare. These challenges are not only important during recruitment into the specialty and training but continue throughout the whole surgical career. Despite recent efforts from surgical societies worldwide to augment women in cardiothoracic visibility and support, a lot of work is needed to facilitate the path for future generations."

Abstract:
BACKGROUND: Malaria is a major public health issue in East Africa, leading to widespread illness and fatalities, especially among vulnerable populations such as children under 5 years of age and pregnant women. Artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs) are the primary treatment modality; however, their efficacy is undermined by the prevalence of substandard ACTs and the increasing risk of resistance. Therefore, it is crucial to improve evidence on quality, therapeutic efficacy, and regulatory performance to promote malaria control efforts in the region.
METHODS: This systematic review followed PRISMA 2020 guidelines, with the protocol registered in PROSPERO (CRD420251135109). Literature was searched in PubMed and Google Scholar databases from July to September 2025. Methodological quality was appraised using MEDQUARG and STROBE. Two reviewers independently extracted data, resolving discrepancies by consensus. The extracted findings were synthesised narratively to identify key trends.
RESULTS: A systematic review of 40 articles from Ethiopia, Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda revealed considerable variation in the quality of Artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs). Across the four East African countries, a total of 3363 ACT samples were tested, of which 375 failed to comply with specification limits set for at least one physicochemical quality parameter. This corresponds to an overall failure rate of 11.2% (375/3363). Country-specific failure rates reflect the highest rate in Uganda (33.3% [16/48]), followed by Kenya (14.1% [10/71]), Tanzania (11.6% [333/2859]), and Ethiopia (4.2% [16/385]). This considerable variation could be attributed to the differences in prevalence, the number of studies conducted, study design, and sampling methodology. The reported poor quality of ACTs, major treatment options in managing malaria cases, could pose a public health threat. Though the studies conducted so far may not give a real picture of the magnitude of poor quality ACTs medicines and their impact on the treatment outcomes, the reports indicated that ACTs remain highly efficacious, with most therapeutic trials reporting polymerase chain reaction-corrected cure rates of ≥ 90%. As indicated in the literature, Artemether-lumefantrine consistently demonstrated strong treatment outcomes, while dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine provided extended prophylactic effects."

Abstract:
Background Evaluating the extent of invasiveness for nonsolid nodules (NSNs) in patients with lung adenocarcinoma at CT could affect clinical decision-making but can be challenging. Purpose To investigate CT characteristics of NSNs associated with pathologic invasiveness and to develop a radiologic ternary classification model for differentiating among preinvasive lesions, minimally invasive adenocarcinoma (MIA), and invasive adenocarcinoma (IAC). Materials and Methods This retrospective study enrolled patients with pathologically confirmed lung adenocarcinoma and suspicious malignant NSNs measuring 3.0-30.0 mm on preoperative CT scans between January 2012 and June 2024. For each NSN, the size, location, margin, shape, nodule CT attenuation, uniformity of density, lobulation sign, reticulation sign, intranodular vessels, bubble-like lucency sign, air bronchogram sign, and pleural retraction sign were independently evaluated by two radiologists blinded to clinical information and pathology results. Univariable ordinal regression and partial proportional odds model analyses were performed. Three nested mixed-effects models were compared in differentiating pathologic invasiveness subtypes. Results This study included 1683 patients (median age, 53 years [IQR, 45-61 years]; 1145 women) with 2125 NSNs. Partial proportional odds model analysis demonstrated that the independent radiologic factors for predicting pathologic invasiveness were average diameter (preinvasive lesion vs MIA: odds ratio [OR], 1.34; MIA vs IAC: OR, 1.54), intranodular vessels (one vessel: OR, 2.22; two vessels: OR, 3.06; more than two vessels: OR, 25.16), mean CT attenuation (OR, 1.54), heterogeneous density (OR, 2.45), spiculation (OR, 1.72), lobulation (OR, 1.50), pleural retraction (OR, 1.43), bubble lucency (OR, 1.81), and air bronchogram (OR, 1.74). The overall diagnostic performance of the radiologic ternary classification model was excellent (C index, 0.92; 95% CI: 0.91, 0.92). Incorporating mean CT attenuation and morphologic features improved model performance in predicting NSN pathologic invasiveness compared with using nodule diameter alone (all P < .001). Conclusion The radiologic ternary classification model demonstrated excellent diagnostic performance in differentiating among preinvasive lesions, MIA, and IAC in NSNs detected on CT images. © RSNA, 2025 Supplemental material is available for this article.

Abstract:
Peer reviewers sometimes comment that their own journal articles should be cited by the journal article under review. Comments concerning relevant articles can be justified, but comments can also be unrelated coercive citations. Here, we used a matched observational study design to explore how citations influence the peer review process. We used a sample of more than 37,000 peer reviews from four journals that use open peer review and make all article versions available. We find that reviewers who were cited in versions after version 1 were more likely to make a favourable recommendation (odds ratio = 1.61; adjusted 99.4% CI: 1.16-2.23), whereas being cited in the first version did not improve their recommendation (odds ratio = 0.84; adjusted 99.4% CI: 0.69-1.03). For all versions of the articles, the reviewers who commented that their own articles should be cited were less likely to recommend approval compared to the reviewers who did not, with the strongest association after the first version (odds ratio = 0.15; adjusted 99.4% CI: 0.08-0.30). Reviewers who included a citation to their own articles were much more likely to approve a revised article that cited their articles compared to a revised article that did not (odds ratio = 3.5; 95% CI: 2.0-6.1). Some reviewers' recommendations depend on whether they are cited or want to be cited.

Abstract:
BACKGROUND: Meat adulteration poses significant food safety and economic fraud challenges, yet traditional detection methods are destructive, time-consuming and unsuitable for rapid screening. Meanwhile, despite advances in non-destructive and rapid hyperspectral imaging (HSI) technology, its predominant spectral-biased approach faces challenges in distinguishing chemically similar adulterants. Notably, unlike authentic meat formed through natural processes, adulterated meat undergoes artificial reconstruction, creating distinct tissue surface morphological differences. These inherent differences offer key insights for rapid adulteration detection. Accordingly, this study developed a novel non-destructive approach combining HSI with independent component analysis (ICA) to extract tissue surface features for beef adulteration detection. Two adulteration types were investigated: restructured minced meat and pork-substituted beef at adulteration levels of 0%, 10%, 20%, 30%, 40% and 50%.
RESULTS: For both adulteration types, ICA was employed to extract tissue surface features from hyperspectral images, with derivatives characterizing surface-change trends. Subsequently, k-nearest neighbor and linear discriminant analysis (LDA) were applied to classify authentic and restructured minced beef, with the LDA model achieving perfect discrimination (R2p = 1.0000, RMSEP = 0.0000). Meanwhile, for detecting pork-substituted beef, hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) and orthogonal partial least squares discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) were employed. The OPLS-DA model significantly outperformed HCA and demonstrated excellent performance (AUC > 0.92 across all substitution ratios). Furthermore, the visualization successfully located pork-substituted regions and quantified substitution levels.
CONCLUSION: This tissue surface feature-based approach provides a rapid, accurate and non-destructive method for meat adulteration detection, offering significant potential for industrial implementation, particularly suited for high-throughput screening in meat processing facilities and quality assurance operations. © 2025 Society of Chemical Industry."

Abstract:
Choosing the right statistical tests is essential for reliable results, but errors, like picking the wrong test or misinterpreting data, can easily lead to incorrect conclusions. Research integrity implies presenting research that is honest, clear, and uses correct statistics. By identifying statistical errors, artificial intelligence (AI) systems such as Statcheck and GRIM-Test increase the reliability of research and assist reviewers. AI helps non-experts analyze data, but it can be unpredictable for experts dealing with complex data analysis. Still, its ease of use and growing abilities show promise. Recent studies show that AI is increasingly helpful in research, assisting in spotting errors in methodology, citations, and statistical analyses. Tools like LLMs, Black Spatula, YesNoError, and GRIM-Test improve accuracy, but they need good data and human checks. AI has moderate accuracy overall but performs better in controlled settings. The Statcheck and GRIM-Test are especially good at spotting statistical errors. As more studies are retracted, AI offers helpful, albeit imperfect, support. It can speed up peer review and reduce reviewer workload, but it still has limits, such as bias and a lack of expert judgment. AI also brings risks like misreading results, ethical issues, and privacy concerns, so editors must make final decisions. To use AI safely and effectively, large, well-labeled datasets, teamwork across fields, and secure systems are required. Human oversight is always necessary to review research processes and ensure their reliability; humans must make the final decision and utilize AI responsibly."

Abstract:
BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The uvularis muscles shorten, elevate, and retract the uvula and assist the levator veli palatini muscle in velopharyngeal closure. This work was designed to present the uvularis muscle advancement technique in a selected group of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) patients, assess the surgical applicability, and report the surgical outcomes.
METHODS: Thirty-four adult patients with single-level OSA who showed a predominant anteroposterior pattern of collapse at the retropalatal region were stratified into two groups: Group A underwent modified anterior palatoplasty (MAP) only, and Group B had modified anterior palatoplasty with uvularis muscle advancement (MAP-UMA).
RESULTS: At 6-8 months, a highly significant improvement was reported as regards the mean apnea hypopnea index (MAP group; from 12.9 to 5.7; MAP-UMA group: from 19.1 to 4.0) and the mean lowest oxygen saturation (MAP group; from 89.9 to 93.7; MAP-UMA group: from 88.7 to 94.3; P < 0.000) in both groups; but the comparison of both groups showed non-significant differences (p > 0.05). The visual analog scale of snoring and Epworth Sleepiness Scale showed a significant (p < 0.05) reduction in both groups; the comparison between groups was highly significant towards MAP-UMA. According to Sher's criteria, successful outcomes were reported in 27 patients (79.41%); MAP = 13 (76.47%), MAP-UMA = 14 (82.35%). The overall percentage of improvement (of the study group) was 78.65 ± 5.41%.
CONCLUSION: MAP-UMA is an effective procedure in patients with OSA who show a predominant retropalatal collapse. UMA results in a significant improvement in snoring. It could be incorporated into multi-level surgery in OSA."

Abstract:
BACKGROUND: The standard technique of laparoscopic cholecystectomy requires four ports and at least two operators (surgeon and assistant). The Single-Operator Multi-Port (SOMP) technique, wherein the surgeon independently manipulates all four ports using self-retaining retractors, remains poorly characterized in the literature.
AIM: To describe the SOMP cholecystectomy technique and evaluate its feasibility, safety, and efficacy through analysis of surgical outcomes in comparison to the standard Multiple-Operator Multi-Port (MOMP) cholecystectomy.
METHODS: We performed a retrospective review of consecutive laparoscopic cholecystectomies from July 2022 to April 2025, by a single surgeon who routinely uses the SOMP technique except when self-retaining retractors are unavailable. Patient demographics, surgical indications, operative time, estimated blood loss, conversion to open surgery, reoperation rate, 30-day readmission, and 30-day mortality were evaluated.
RESULTS: Among 124 consecutive laparoscopic cholecystectomies, 92 cases (74.2%) used the SOMP technique. In the SOMP cohort, the median age was 48, and 66 (71.7%) were female. Thirty-three procedures (35.9%) were elective. Surgical indications included symptomatic cholelithiasis (n=68), chronic cholecystitis (n=38), choledocholithiasis (n=25), biliary pancreatitis (n=15), and acute cholecystitis (n=14). Additional port placement for better retraction was needed in seven patients (7.6%). Median operative time was 75 minutes, with a median estimated blood loss of 25 mL and three patients (3.3%) required readmission within 30 days. There were no reoperations or mortalities within 30 days. Multivariable analysis demonstrated that the SOMP technique was an independent factor associated with lower operative time (β for MOMP =41.2, p<0.001) and conversion rate to open approach (OR for MOMP = 20.4, p<0.001).
CONCLUSION: The SOMP technique using self-retaining retractors is a safe and efficient approach to laparoscopic cholecystectomy, with possible benefits in improved functional design, reduced costs, and staffing needs.

Abstract:
PURPOSE: Since the COVID-19 pandemic, olfactory loss has been recognized as a highly prevalent condition that greatly impacts the quality of life. Similar to other sensory implants, the idea of an olfactory implant has emerged. Evidence indicates that electrical stimulation of specific olfactory structures can evoke smell sensations. However, debates on the most appropriate anatomical target and surgical technique for implantation are still ongoing. By extrapolating data from other surgical indications, transcranial approaches appear to carry a lower risk of cerebrospinal fluid leakage and infection compared with endoscopic endonasal routes. The aim of this study was to compare two electrode placements (dorsal olfactory bulb and ventral olfactory tract) through a supraorbital keyhole craniotomy in human cadavers.
METHOD: Four fresh human cadavers were dissected in a staged manner. Supraorbital keyhole craniotomy was performed through an eyebrow incision and the frontal lobe was slightly retracted to allow angled (30°) endoscope insertion. An auditory brainstem implant (ABI) from MED-EL was used for electrode placement.
RESULTS: Endoscopic placement of the electrode on the dorsal side of the olfactory bulb was achieved after orbital roof drilling in all cases, but was not stable. On the contrary, endoscopic placement of an electrode under the olfactory tract was easily achieved without drilling and the electrode was stable between the olfactory tract and the planum sphenoidale, behind the olfactory bulb.
CONCLUSION: Ventral olfactory tract implantation posterior to the olfactory bulb using an ABI is straightforward and is associated with satisfactory electrode stability. Such a procedure could be used for clinical pilot studies evaluating the effects of various stimulation protocols on the olfactory tract in patients with long-lasting olfactory loss."

Abstract:
With the deepening of smart grid construction, the complexity of power grid material warehousing and emergency distribution continues to increase, which puts higher demands on efficient and scalable optimization models. In response to the problems of insufficient search efficiency and weak adaptability to dynamic disaster scenarios in traditional methods, this study proposes an optimization model that integrates a multi-strategy collaborative adaptive chaotic particle swarm optimization algorithm and an improved imperialist competitive algorithm. The experiment is conducted based on multiple types of emergency scenarios, and the results show that the accuracy of material classification of the model is as high as 98.73%, and the delivery time is shortened from 6.78 h to 4.56 h in earthquake scenarios. In the solution of the supply chain distribution path, the single iteration calculation is only 0.45s, which combines stability and efficiency. This model improves the search diversity of inventory parameter optimization by introducing multi-strategy chaotic disturbances and adaptive inertia weights, and combines fishbone warehouse layout to enhance picking efficiency. In the path planning stage, research is conducted to enhance the adaptability of algorithms to complex constraints and dynamic environments through immune penalty correction mechanisms and pheromone adaptive balancing strategies. Research results denote that this model has significant advantages in multi-objective optimization, warehouse layout planning, and emergency logistics path scheduling. This study provides feasible technical solutions for smart grid material management and emergency distribution, as well as new methodological references for complex supply chain optimization research."

Abstract:
BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Side-effects after breast cancer treatment, including radiotherapy (RT), can drastically affect a patient's quality of life. This study aims to identify anatomical regions where RT dose is related to breast side-effects using the voxel-wise image-based data mining (IBDM) technique.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data of 922 patients included in the REQUITE study and who underwent RT after breast-conserving surgery were analysed. All patients were treated supine. We analysed breast pain, oedema, atrophy, induration, and nipple retraction, scored before and after RT by clinicians and patients. We investigated the toxicity burden using the area under the curve for toxicity over time (ToxT-AUC) and applied IBDM by normalising all dose distributions to three reference anatomies. To do so, we established a spatial normalisation pipeline, ensuring that the ipsilateral breast was aligned (flipping all left-side treatments laterally). Dose distributions were converted to equivalent dose in 2 Gy-fraction (EQD2, α/β = 1.7 Gy and 3 Gy) to account for different RT fractionations. To determine the relevance of each identified region, we used multivariable ordinal regression, including patient-specific factors and clinical variables.
RESULTS: Significant regions associated with each breast side-effect were found in different breast quadrants. The regions showed higher mean EQD2 than the complete breast contour, particularly for grade 2+ (p < 0.01). Dosimetric parameters extracted from the region were significant in multivariable analysis.
CONCLUSION: We found regions within the breast where the local dose associates with breast side-effects after breast RT. This result opens a new hypothesis which could help reduce side-effects after breast radiotherapy."
