An immutable,\ncore assumption in Israel’s security strategy was the need to retain our ability to\ndeter, and if necessary defeat, our enemies. A nuclear Syria — or Iraq, or Iran —\nwould dramatically alter the balance of power in the region, at obvious risk to\nIsrael. Syria posed a particular threat, as part of an increasingly close alliance with\nIran, and with Hizbollah in Lebanon.\n\nThe question, however, was how and when to strike the reactor. Olmert wanted\nto attack within days. He seemed to assume that, as a former chief of staff, ’'d nod\nenthusiastically and go along with him. I did understand the reasons for his sense\nof urgency. Not only did we have to make sure we attacked before the fuel was on\nsite. There was always the risk the Syrians would find out that we were aware of\ntheir nuclear facility, putting them on even higher alert. But the operational\nchallenge was complex. We need a fail-safe plan to destroy the reactor. We had to\ndo it in such a way as to avoid a full-scale military confrontation with Syria if\npossible. And we had to ensure we were ready for that, if it did happen. It took\nvery little time for me to realize that none of those prerequisites was yet in place.\nNot unlike the recent Lebanon war, we were choosing between two off-the-shelf\nplans from the kirya. One involved using a large military force, and would almost\ncertainly draw us into a major conflict with Syria. The other was a smaller,\ntargeted operation. But it remained untested, and there was no certainty it would\nactually destroy the reactor.\n\nOver the next few months, Olmert got more and more frustrated with the fact\nwe hadn’t yet attacked, and frustrated with me as well. We held dozens of\nmeetings, sometimes two or three a day, chaired by the Prime Minister, sometimes\nby me as Defense Minister, or by the chief of staff or service commanders.\nInvariably, I began my remarks by saying: “We have to destroy the reactor.” This\nwas not because I felt that any of us seriously doubted that. It was because Olmert\nwas beginning to suggest to the few ministers and senior officers aware of our\nplanning that I was against attacking the reactor. In fact, I was working with the\nmilitary and Mossad to ensure we had a plan that would succeed, with the\nminimum possible risk of drawing us into a major clash with the Syrians after the\nfacility was destroyed. I was also working — with the help of the Americans — to\nmake sure we could get the forces and munitions in place in the north of Israel to\n\n403\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_028251\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

My favorite historical figures are\npolitical and religious dissidents. My closest friends are iconoclasts. Some of my best teachers\nwere fired.\n\nThe First Amendment would have been nothing more than a parchment promise had it not been\ngiven life by brave political dissidents and bold judicial dissenters. Because of these provocateurs,\nthe First Amendment has not become ossified with age. It has changed with the times, sometimes\nfor the better, sometimes for the worse. Although the literal words have remained the same for\nmore than two centuries, two of the most important ones have been changed beyond recognition.\nThese words are “Congress” and “no.” (“Congress shall make no law....”) The controversial\nrole of these two words can best be illustrated by a story; perhaps aprocrophyl but reflecting\nreality, about two great and contentious justices, Hugo Black, who claimed to be an absolutist\nand literalist when it came to the words of the First Amendment, and Felix Frankfurter, who\nadvocated a more functional balancing approach despite the seemingly clear words of that\nAmendment. In a case involving censorship by a state, Black pulled out his ragged old copy of\nthe Constitution, turned to the First Amendment and read it out loud to the lawyer representing\nthe state. “Read the words,” he shouted at the intimidated lawyer. “It says Congress shall make\nNO law abridging the freedom of speech.” He banged the table as he shouted and repeated the\nword “no.” “What don’t you understand about the word ‘no,’” he asked rhetorically. Justice\nFrankfurter interrupted and said, “You’re reading the words wrong.” The lawyer looked startled\nas the Justice explained. “It doesn’t say ‘Congress shall make NO law.’ It says, “CONGRESS\nshall make no law,’” banging the table as he shouted and repeated the word “Congress.” He then\ncontinued, “This law wasn’t passed by Congress, it was passed by the state. What don’t you\nunderstand about the word ‘Congress,’” he asked, mocking his fellow justice.\n\nBy emphasizing different words, the two justices were giving radically different meanings to the\nvery same language of the First Amendment.\n\nThe reality is that both of these words—“Congress” and “no”—have been excised over time. The\nfirst—“Congress”—was central to the history of the Bill of Rights, which was seen by its framers\nlargely as a bill of restrictions on the power of the national legislature—namely “Congress.”\nThere was considerable concern that the Constitution, which replaced the Articles of\nConfederacy, bestowed too much power on the national legislature, thus reducing the rights\n(really the powers) of the states to legislate for their citizens.*° The First Amendment was not\nintended by its framers to impose restrictions on the states. In fact when the Bill of Rights was\nenacted, and for many years thereafter, many states had laws severely abridging the freedom of\nspeech and of the press. (Several states also had officially established churches and officially\ndiscriminated against Catholics, Jews, Turks and “other” Pathens.) Ifthe framers had wanted to\nimpose restriction on the states, it would have been simple to have written a more general\n\n°6 The rarely invoked 10 Amendment makes this clear: “The powers not delegated to the United States by the\nConstitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people.”\n\n86\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_017173\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

The Master my friend was\nreferring to was Master Nan. Though he was largely unknown outside of China - I\nam sure you had not heard of him until a few pages ago - in China he was an icon.\nAfter his return to the mainland in the 1990s, his books about Buddhism and\nphilosophy sold millions of copies. His lectures are watched on DVDs and the\nInternet, and he owns a fond fame that reaches across generations and transcends\npolitics or art or philosophy. You are as likely to find a copy of his book on the desk\nof a university President as stuffed into the back pocket of a tea-server in Chengdu.\n\nAs you can imagine, when my friend first introduced me to the idea of someone like\nMaster Nan serving as a spiritual mentor to the figures struggling to master this\nhuge country, figures I had met and worked with in the brutally rational business of\neveryday life in a modernizing China, it raised all sorts of questions. We both have\nthe same master? But in China, one thing you discover pretty quickly is that honest\nunderstanding of anything isn’t achieved by asking lots of questions, particularly not\nthe direct sort. Yun Men had it right: Ten thousand kinds of clever talk get you\nnowhere meaningful. But with her one sentence, the dinner conversation, which had\nbeen moving pleasantly enough through the eddies of China’s politics and\neconomics, passed into deeper water, where it has stayed in the years since.\n\nMaster Nan’s particular passion, | learned that night, was a branch of Chinese Ch’an\nBuddhism that had, about 1000 years ago, provided the seeds for the Japanese\nschool of “instant illumination,” known as Rinzai Zen. Rinzai is famed in the west for\nasking students to grapple with koans, the sorts of puzzles - “What was your face\nbefore your were born?” or “What is the sound of one hand clapping?” or just “Mu!”\n- that can never be approached or answered by reason alone. They require nothing\nbut pure, trained instinct. Koans are not like math problems or word puzzles, so\nmuch as questions that have to be answered with your whole soul. We don’t really\nhave an educational concept like this in the west, but the aim of Rinzai meditation\nand learning is to arrive at kensho (jianxing in Chinese), a sudden and complete\nunderstanding of the true nature of the world. Such “instant illumination” marks a\nvery eastern sensibility: Real truth resists the grasp of mere logic. It can’t be simply\nexplained, or taught with words alone. It calls on more immediate feelings, in the\nway we night fall in love or get angry. In Rinzai study, the aim is to tighten and\ncompress your mind with meditation and focus and exercise - and the occasional\nslapping sharpness of a hardwood “enlightenment stick” - as a way to open it, with\nthe goal of instant, blazing enlightenment. In such a moment, all sorts of invisible\nrelations become unforgettably obvious.\n\nI] had been a student of Rinzai since | was 16. So it was that, in the springtime of the\n\nyear after that dinner in Beijing, I was surprisingly, luckily invited to Master Nan’s\ncampus.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_018240\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

Therefore,\nyour actions are not predetermined by anything in your local corner of\nthe Universe — the past light cone if you want to be strict about the physics.\n\nThe determined determinists are a determined bunch. Just because\nthe information that determines your actions cannot be encoded by the\nparticles you are made from, does not mean youare free. The information\ncould be stored in parts of the Universe we cannot see, or held outside\nthe Universe in some sort of cosmic hard drive. Every creative event in\nthe Universe would be specified in this store.\n\nBut this begs the third question: How was this store of information\ngenerated in the first place? If a Universe contains creative things — as our\nUniverse does — there is no way to computably generate the necessary\ndeterminist store of information. The Universe has free will because there\nis no deterministic process that could generate it.\n\nIf our Universe were a Turing machine, everything within it\nwould be too. Think about the deterministic clockwork argument I\ngave earlier. If you try to construct a better — say a more random -—\nmachine inside a Turing machine, an observer could simply ignore the\nbetter machine hidden within it, and watch the outer machine work.\nThe outer machine will predict the operation of the inner machine\nperfectly, even if the inner machine is fiendishly complicated. We\nhave to consider the machine on which our human software runs. Our\nbodies, our minds, all that we are, is software running on the Universe's\nhardware of quarks and photons. If the hardware is deterministic, then\nso is our software. And if the hardware is deterministic, there can be no\ncreativity within the Universe.\n\nSo the free will camp has an argument easily as frustrating as the\none deployed by the determinists. Every time a determinist asks, “How\ndo you know you were not always going to do that?” the free will believer\ncan reply, “You asked me a question. If this dialogue is to have any\nsignificance, then we must exist in a rational Universe and, therefore, the\nlaws of information give us creativity and free will. If you believe we are\nfully determined, there is no point in my answering your question.”\n\nI reason.

That's more like it, | thought.\n\nSome S&M encounters have a rhythm to them, a poetry: a beginning and an end that\nbecome clear to the participants as they go along. This one didn't -- at least not to me. So\nI didn't rely on him to bring it to a close. After a while, I safeworded out, and took a\nbreath to still my tears.\n\nMr. Ambition was quiet again. I was having trouble reading him. There was some energy\ncaught inside him, coiled like a dragon, but I couldn't tell if it was violence or something\nelse. I put a halt to my own emotional cycle and tried to focus on him. \"How are you\nfeeling?\" I asked, but he couldn't tell me. I asked a few more questions, and he just\ncouldn't answer. He just didn't know.\n\nI never got another word from him on how he felt about that encounter. I wondered if I\nwas being too careful in how I asked about it; I wondered if he wanted me to push harder;\nI wondered if I'd already pushed him too far.\n\nI suspected there were some dramatic feelings trapped in Mr. Ambition. But I wasn't sure\nI currently had the warmth to coax them out.\n\nte Ok ok\n\nIn the past, I've fallen in love so hard that I felt like the world was black-and-white when\nI was away from my lover; I felt like I only saw color when I was with him. I have dated\nmen where the chemistry was so intense, so obvious, that it hung in the air between us\nlike smoke. I've had sex that felt like telepathy. It's pretty awesome when it works. And\nit's easier to get that with some people than with others: some guys, I meet them and it's\nlike we speak the same language already.\n\nWith some guys, it's not instant, but it also doesn't take long to build our mutual\nvocabulary.\n\nAnd then I've dated guys where the learning curve -- both sexually and temperamentally\n-- was much longer. It was less instinctive. But it was not impossible. So I know for a fact\nthat people can build chemistry. Sometimes it's just there, but sometimes you can create\nit.\n\nMy relationship with Mr. Ambition was definitely polyamorous, but a few weeks in, I\ndecided I was really into him... and I started managing my incentives. There was another\nguy I saw occasionally, with whom I had stronger instinctive chemistry. This other guy\nagreed with me that we didn't want a Big Important Relationship. This other guy will\nscrew up my incentives if I hang out with him too much, I thought, and I limited my time\nwith him. I set rules with myself: I didn't call him, I didn't text him. I knew: /fJ let myself\nget too intensely into this other guy, that could inhibit my ability to bond with Mr.\nAmbition.\n\nI told the other guy that once my relationship with Mr. Ambition was more stable, we\nmight be able to pursue something more intense.

Even if he succeeded, I figured\nthe best case would be an agreement that, at least on paper, delayed the Iranians’\ndevelopment of a weapon. My hope remained that Israel’s relationship with the\nAmericans would be sufficiently strong for us to reach a formal understanding of\nwhat form of surgical military strike each of our countries might take if Iran didn’t\nhonor the terms of a negotiated deal.\n\nWhen I first left political life after my election defeat in 2001, I'd described my\nstatus as the equivalent of a reserve officer. I said, and believed, it was unlikely P’'d\nreturn for the foreseeable future. But I knew it wasn’t impossible. This time was\ndifferent. When I announced publicly that I was leaving politics, five days after the\nGaza cease-fire, I pointed that I had spent the greater part of my life as a soldier.\nI’d never had a burning desire to be a politician. Though I believed that what I'd\nattempted, and achieved, in government would prove to have safeguarded and\nstrengthened Israel, I knew that important challenges and decisions still lay ahead.\nSo did our unfulfilled dream of being a country that was not just strong, secure and\nprosperous, but socially just and at peace. Yet I believed it was right to draw my\ntime on the front line of politics to an end. Though I didn’t say so, I thought to\nmyself: this time doesn’t feel like a step back into the reserves, but genuinely like\nthe end of something. Though my dedication to a secure, strong, just, democratic\nand ultimately peaceful Israel would not change, whatever contribution I might\n\n431\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_028279\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

One hot\nbattlefield instant - an explosion under an armorless truck, say - could freeze the\noperations of a billion-dollar division. Nearly everyone begins to ask, sometimes out\nloud: Why did that happen? Followed pretty quickly by: What the hell are we doing\nhere? The little bombs were shaking more than the Humvees.\n\nWalking into the Pentagon, one is struck by cascading sensations of immensity and\nvolume and, frankly, gravity. Surely, you reflect, there must be someone here with a\nplan for everything? But there was not; there is not now. Yet the massiveness, the\nineffable historical density and weight of American power, is so breathtaking that its\nfrequent impotence in the face of a changing world represents a particular and\nunforgettable and, well, searing shock. The soldiers who had experienced those cold,\nfailing nights at the edge of superpower rippled with unease. This was the slim\ncomfort of life inside big, old and lamed structures confronting the fast, blithe and\nunstoppable future.\n\nBy 2009, with the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq settling into a low boil, America’s\ngenerals again began wondering what other cracks were spreading around the\nworld. The Unknown and the Future seemed to have an uneasy parallel meaning.\nThe diplomats worried about this too, of course, but with soldiers dying every day,\nthe questions had a particular urgency for the military. The top of the command\nchain asked incessantly about what they might be missing. What fissures were\nrunning even through their own building, masked by its scale but waiting quietly to\nmake their best plans look foolish and dangerous? And: How they could possibly\nconfront this world with 30% less of what they had a decade ago? They made a few\nphone calls. | received one of them.\n\nvm\n\nIt was hard not to notice, if you picked up one of those incoming queries from\nWashington and were asked to draft your views on how this uncertain world might\nbe approached, that one of the main aims of the American military in recent years -\nreducing the number of terrorists - appeared to be backfiring. This was an irritating\nfeature of many global problems. In spreading market capitalism ever wider, the\nworld was also digging an ever wider moat between rich and poor, for instance. In\ntrying to make the world modern with more connection we were, we found, lashing\nourselves to some very unmodern risks. And in waging the most expensive war on\nterrorism in human history, the US was uneasily discovering that it was creating\nmore terrorists. Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld had sketched the nature of\nthis puzzle in an October, 2003 memo with acid clarity. He asked: “Are we capturing,\nkilling or deterring and dissuading more terrorists every day than the madrassas\nand the radical clerics are recruiting, training and deploying against us?”3”?

It remains to be shown that taboo trade-offs demonstrate\nthis characteristic. It also provides an important policy prescription regarding policies\nforbidding taboo trade-offs, for example, the ban on euthanasia: such policies are socially\nsuboptimal, since the benefits of cooperating without looking accrue to the individuals\nwho advocate them, but the costs are borne by society.\n\nFinally, our model offers an explanation for emotions such as love, and can thus be\nthought of as a formalization of Frank (1988). Love has the property that we behave\naltruistically towards our partners regardless of what temptations arise [30], as illustrated\nby the wedding vow, “for better or for worse, for richer, for poorer, in sickness and in\nhealth.” For example, love causes individuals to ignore other potential mates, even if those\nmates are better than one’s current mate, as Shakespeare’s Juliet did when her love for\nRomeo led her to rebuff the advances of the otherwise-more-suitable Paris.\n\nWhy does love have this property? Our model suggests that those in love will more\noften be chosen as long-term partners. If this argument in fact underlies love, then it\nis crucial that love is observable, and that it necessarily cannot be displayed while still\nattending to costs. There is evidence consistent with this: related emotions are observable\n[31], cannot be faked [32], and are relied upon by partners when choosing whether to\ncooperate [33]. There is also reason to believe love and related emotions would be hard\nto fake, given their autonomic origins, and the costs of placing their activation under\nconscious control [30, 28]. However, it remains to be shown that love in particular has\nthese attributes, and that it cannot be displayed while attending to costs.\n\nOur formalism adds novel insights to Frank’s argument about love.

At one point he counted among his friends former President Bill\nClinton, Donald Trump and other high-powered figures.\n\nThe appeal court decision described the background of Epstein's case, stating that in 2006, the Federal Bureau of Investigation \"began investigating\nallegations that Jeffrey Epstem had sexually abused several minor girls.\"\n\nIn September 2007, federal prosecutors struck the non-prosecution deal with Epstein, but didn't tell the victims, court filings say.\n\nPhotos: Crimes that shocked South Florida\n\n\"Not only did the United States neglect to confer with the victims before it entered into the agreement with Epstein, it also failed to notify them of its\nexistence for at least nine months,\" Circuit Judge William H. Pryor wrote in the appeals court decision.\n\nTn June 2008, Epstein pleaded guilty to a state charge of procuring a person under the age of 18 for prostitution and was sentenced to 18 months in prison.\nHe spent 13 months behind bars, and is registered as a sex offender in Florida.\n\nThe situation also resulted im civil suits being filed against Epstein, who according to media reports settled claims from about two dozen young women who\nalleged he paid them for sexual massages at his Palm Beach mansion, some as young as 14, according to media reports.\n\nTo the attorneys who represent the Jane Does 1 and ?, the sentence was much lighter than the years, or possibly decades, that Epstein could've spent behind\nbars had he been prosecuted in the federal system.\n\nThey're hoping that the correspondence, ordered released by the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals, will shed light on what they say is an unusually lenient\ndeal.\n\n\"T can say that I've been teaching criminal law for more than two decades and I have never seen a plea agreement as lenient as this one, for hands-on sex\n\noffenders,” said Cassell, who is based in Salt Lake City.\n\nBut one of Epstein's attorney's. Martin Weinberg, based in Boston, disputed those characterizations. Weinberg said Monday that the plea agreement was\n\"reached in good faith\" and that \"it's not a fair conclusion” to describe the agreement as either improper or tainted by Epstein's wealth.\n\n\"T's Mr. Cassell's hope that this correspondence may support that theory, but the reality is that the U_S. Attorney's Office made a responsible judgment in\nhow to implement the law,” Weinberg said.\n\nWeinberg said he was concerned about the potential impact the ruling would have on the ability of criminal defense attorneys and prosecutors to\ncommunicate confidentially.\n\nHe also said he and Epstein co-counsel, Miami criminal defense attorney Roy Black, will ask the Atlanta-based appeals court to review the decision.\n\nAs for the Jane Does, who are now over 18, it's just the latest development in a long legal saga, another one of their attorneys said.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_030832\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

Private prosecutions should be\nrare in well-functioning public prosecution systems, because public agencies pursue most provable cases and because private\nactors must bear considerable costs to press charges themselves. Moreover, other rules and institutions - including other\nsafeguards on prosecutorial charging - endure despite few indications of their utility. There has never been a successful claim\nthat a criminal charge violated the Equal Protection prohibition on racially biased charging, °” but few argue the doctrine lacks\nat least normative value. °° Grand juries rarely reject prosecutors’ [*872] charging requests for indictments, but courts\ncontinue to tout them as a structural check on prosecutors. °+ Like private prosecution, these safeguards may work by deterring\nbiased or ill-conceived prosecutorial decisions; their efficacy 1s probably impossible to measure.\n\nA contributing explanation for the U.S. aversion to private prosecution may lie m a familiar theme of U.S. law and history:\nrace. During the first several decades of the nineteenth century, when private citizens could prosecute crimes, many states - and\n\nnot only Southern ones - either denied African Americans legal capacity as litigants °°\n\nor barred them from testifying under\noath on the basis of race. Among other effects, those barriers barred private prosecutions by African Americans. °° After 1865\n- an era in which rights to litigate and testify were viewed by many as more meaningful than the right to vote ?’ - those race-\nbased legal disabilities were abolished. °° In the same period, private charging authority, already on the decline, was abolished\nin most [*873] states that still permitted it. States that retained a formal litigation role for crime victims did so by allowing\nprivately funded attorneys to assist in prosecutions filed and controlled by public prosecutors, thus ensuring that public officials\nare the exclusive gatekeepers of criminal law enforcement. Between the 1840s and 1860s, prosecutors had become locally\nelected officials in nearly all states. That effectively aligned their charging monopoly with the preferences of local white\nmajorities (or white minorities in localities in which black citizens were the majority, once Southern whites succeeded in\n\ndisenfranchising black citizens). °?

There is still a long way to go, from\npreschool to an AGI system that is capable of, say, passing the Turing Test or serving as an\neffective artificial scientist.\n\nOur suggestion is to extend the school metaphor further, and make use of existing curricula\nfor higher levels of virtual education: grade school, secondary school, and all levels of post-\nsecondary education. If an AGI can pass online primary and secondary schools such as e-\ntutor.com, and go on to earn an online degree from an accredited university, then clearly said\nAGI has successfully achieved “human level, roughly humanlike AGI.” This sort of testing is\ninteresting not only because it allows assessment of stages intermediate between preschool and\nadult, but also because it tests humanlike intelligence without requiring precise imitation of\nhuman behavior.\n\nIf an AI can get a BA degree at an accredited university, via online coursework (assuming\nfor simplicity courses where no voice interaction is needed), then we should consider that AT to\nhave human-level intelligence. University coursework spans multiple disciplines, and the details\nof the homework assignments and exams are not known in advance, so like a human student\nthe AGI team can’t cheat.\n\nIn addition to the core coursework, a schooling approach also tests basic social interaction\nand natural language communication, ability to do online research, and general problem solving\nability. However, there is no rigid requirement to be strictly humanlike in order to pass university\nclasses.\n\nMost of our concrete examples in the following chapters will pertain to the preschool context,\nbecause it’s simple to understand, and because we feel that getting to the “AGI preschool\nstudent” level is going to be the largest leap. Once that level is obtained, moving further\nwill likely be difficult also, but we suspect it will be more a matter of steady incremental\nimprovements — whereas the achievement of preschool-level functionality will be a large leap\nfrom the current situation.\n\n16.6 Issues with Virtual Preschool Engineering\n\nAs noted above there are two broad approaches to realizing the “AGI Preschool” idea: using\nthe AGI to control a physical robot and then crafting a preschool environment suitable to the\nrobot’s sensors and actuators; or, using the AGI to control a virtual agent in an appropriately\nrich virtual-world preschool. The robotic approach is harder from an AI perspective (as one must\ndeal with problems of sensation and actuation), but easier from an environment-construction\nperspective. In the virtual world case, one quickly runs up against the current limitations\nof virtual world technologies, which have been designed mainly for entertainment or social-\nnetworking purposes, not with the requirements of AGI systems in mind.\n\nIn Chapter 9 we discussed the general requirements that an environment should possess to be\nsupportive of humanlike intelligence. Referring back to that list, it’s clear that current virtual\nworlds are fairly strong on multimodal communication, and fairly weak on naive physics.

I have included the story in the body of the e-mail as well. \nThanks, \nStephanie \nOmar Quadhafi is hunkering down in Tripoli giving press interviews denying that rebels are taking over \nEastern Libya. Oil prices are shooting over one hundred dollars a barrel. The US government is on the \nverge of a shut down. These are not the top secret opening lines to Aaron Sorkin's new script, but the \nglobal headlines of a world spinning out of control. I head to Los Angeles like an overdressed lemming to \nattend the 83rd Academy Awards and attempt to make sense of artists thrust into combat. \nFor the second year nearly 6,000 Academy members have nominated 10 films and the battle is down to two. \nThe beloved timeless classic, \"The King's Speech\" marches into the arena as the front runner, but \npassionate supporters of the brilliant edgier (and critics darling) \"The Social Network\" have not \nconceded. The ballots are counted, the party invites are out and still the feelings are raw. Filmmakers \nare exhausted from campaigning. \nAt Bryan Lourd's famous star studded party Sony Classics' Co-President Michael Barker announces to me he \nhas taken a random sampling of voters in the room. He says, \"There will be a 'Social Network' upset at \nthe Kodak Theater.\" Shear panic radiates from my every pore as he says, \"I am joking.\" It's like color \nwar at summer camp. \nWoody Allen and George Lucas tell me they are no longer members of the Academy because pitting artists \nagainst each other to determine the quality of their work is insane. They are right. \nMy event and publicity company is considered \"Switzerland\" by the studios, as we help every filmmaker to \npresent and position his work. This year I am somewhat emotionally sucked in. \nIn 2005 I meet the unknown 32-year-old English director Tom Hooper on his first film for HBO,\"Elizabeth \nI\". The Emmy award winning movie stars Helen Mirren, who takes credit for discovering him directing \nEnglish television. Helen later wins her Oscar for portraying Queen Elizabeth in \"The Queen\". Queen \nElizabeth is the daughter of King George VI portrayed by Oscar winner Colin Firth in \"The King's Speech\". \nI also become Hooper's champion encouraging many to see his early work including his herculean 10 hour \nHBO mini-series \"John Adams\" produced by Tom Hanks. \nSix years later at the Telluride Film Festival Tom Hooper is bathing in the glory of a hysterical \nstanding ovation with Colin Firth and Geoffrey Rush at the very first screening of \"The King's Speech.\" \nSurprisingly, this drama's subtle humor gets big laughs leading up to its emotional ending. \nWithin two weeks, at The Toronto Film Festival, Harvey Weinstein is now standing with his filmmakers \nwitnessing the same reaction. The film wins The Audience Prize. Their strategy is to say nothing. Do \nnothing. They have a possible Oscar winner. Four out of five past Best Pictures have premiered in \nToronto. \nCut to New York City at the end of September. It's the opening night at The Film Society of Lincoln \nCenter. One of America's most important and prolific producers Scott Rudin, along with Jesse Eisenberg, \nAndrew Garfield and Aaron Sorkin are in a brightly lit box waving down to their equally hysterical \naudience who have just seen \"The Social Network\". \nThe film opens the next day to rave reviews and endless publicity. David Fincher is off making \"The Girl \nwith the Dragon Tattoo\". Aaron Sorkin becomes the face of the film and an immediate shoo-in for an Oscar. \nThe Hamptons International Film Festival in October suddenly becomes a launching pad for \"127 Hours\", \nwhere cool Yale/NYU student James Franco appears and receives a heroic standing ovation. More Oscar buzz. \n\"Black Swan\" also unspools there in a tiny theater as Madonna, Alec Baldwin and even Harvey Weinstein \nslip in the back. Darren Aronofsky, sporting the ever present cool wool scarf around his neck is hailed a \ngenius. Natalie Portman is instantly the hot nominee for Best Actress. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 029773 \nBoth films are sensational and movie goers go nuts, but it is \"The King's Speech\" that edges out the \ncompetition for The Audience Prize. \nMid-November David O. Russell and Mark Wahlberg, working together for the third time, sneak \"The Fighter\" \nin Manhattan. As their audience erupts in cheers, I tell producer/actor Wahlberg, \"Clint Eastwood is \ngoing to kill himself for not directing this.\" Wahlberg says, \"You are wrong. He turned it down because \nhe's done it. He has seen it and he loves it.\" I instantly lavish my affection and praise on David O. \nRussell, who becomes my new Clint Eastwood. Christian Bale and Melissa Leo are hailed the supporting \nactors to beat. \n\"True Grit\" directed by the Coen Brothers and also produced by Scott Rudin doesn't premiere till mid-\nDecember at the Ziegfeld as the last serious Oscar contender for Best Picture. It gallops off to box \noffice gold. \nThis is the year many of the 78 million Baby Boomers go back to the theaters. Five small budget \nindependent films become surprise hits as each exceeds $100 million \n\"The Social Network\" now cements its battle cry with one word; \"relevance\". Mark Zuckerberg lands on the \ncover of Time Magazine as The Person of the Year. A smart and extensive ad campaign positions the film in \nthe lead. Critics and pundits proclaim the race is over. \"The Social Network\" is the clear winner. \nEveryone goes on holiday. \nThis is probably the only time in Harvey Weinstein's life that he is caught off guard. He quickly \nmobilizes an inner team of 15 and conducts strategy meetings 7 days a week, including Christmas. They \nbecome like a Chinese Restaurant...always open. A generational war is in full swing. Harvey screens his \nfilm for the older voters. Everything is done by the books. Budgets are limited. He sends screenwriter \nDavid Seidler and Tom H000per to every corner of the country doing q+a's till they are blue in the face \nfrom \"finding their voice.\" SAG voters begin seeing the film 2 and 3 times. \nIn January the Golden Globes voted on by about 88 foreign journalists gives Best Drama to \"The Social \nNetwork\", Best Director to David Fincher and Best Screenplay to Aaron Sorkin. Their film is still \nperceived as the Oscar winner. \nTeam Weinstein underestimates their hard work and is in shock when \"The King's Speech\" wins the PGA in \nL.A. Harvey doesn't even attend and is working in Sundance. They are equally surprised when Tom Hooper \nwins the DGA and the actors win the SAG Ensemble. The BAFTAs reinforced the lead. They are now the front \nrunner. It takes the media a few weeks to catch on. \nThe Daily Mail announces Her Royal Highness, Queen Elizabeth has enjoyed a private screening of \"The \nKing's Speech\" and is \"moved\" by the film. With no proof the Queen has actually seen the film, the \nWeinstein Company sends out a global press release thanking her Majesty for the endorsement. They also \nacknowledge Prime Minister David Cameron's private Christmas screening. \nOn Oscar night, it isn't until Hilary Swank surprisingly yells out Hooper's name for Best Director that \nHarvey's gang finally realizes they are getting the Oscar for Best Picture. The King has spoken. \nFriday, February 24th \nMid-day, I arrive at The Beverly Hills Hotel, where I have stayed for thirty years. As the housekeepers \nunpack my bags upstairs I peek into the Polo Lounge and find icon Warren Beatty in a booth. He motions me \nover to meet an Egyptian fashion editor from Cairo. I say, \"Warren, you are a little late to visit \nCairo.\" I tell him I'm rooting for Annette and love her film \"The Kids Are All Right\". Warren tells me \n\"The Social Network\" will win. \nThis year I am two days late arriving to Oscar weekend. I am now shown to a very very very small room, \nthe size of a broom closet. Uncharacteristically, I have a slight melt down. I am moved. The housekeepers \nrun down the hall with my clothes flying. I calm down. The hotel is sold out. I get someone else's room. \nAnother poor schmuck checking in downstairs will get the broom closet. \nIt is cold, grey and rainy. Taffata, organdy and embroidered silk evening clothes hang in my closet. I \nstay in my sweaters and fur coat and head to Arianna Huffington's Mediterranean house in Beverly Hills \nwhere Wendi Murdoch and Arianna are hosting a party for Tom Freston's wife, the beautiful blond Kathy. \nThe book is called \"Veganist: Lose Weight, Get Healthy, Change the World. A perfect book for Monks. \nArianna has just sold the Huffington Post for to AOL to $315 million dollars and rumored to have \npersonally landed around $20 million. She is euphoric as she greets Nicole Kidman and Keith Urban at the \ndoor. Other drenched power players ushered in under umbrellas include Disney's Bob Iger and wife Willow \nBay, Fox's Jim Gianopulos, Candice Bergen and journalist daughter Chloe Malle, Google's Eric Schmidt, \nOliver Stone avoiding questions about Charlie Sheen and escorting his daughter Tara, Moby, Jamie Niven, \nBrian Grazer, Vivi Nevo, Tracey Ullman, CBS's Les Moonves and Julie Chen, Rob Reiner, Paramount's Brad \nGrey and fiancé Cassandra Marc and Jeff Bezos. Hors d'oeuvres include pigs in blankets, a food group not \nmentioned in Kathy's book. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 029774 \nThe party action migrates to UTA Jim Burkus's home in the neighborhood for \"True Grit's\" Ethan and Joel \nCoen. I pass Ron Howard on the way in and he says, \"Keep me on your list.\" Is he kidding? Sunrise and \nMark Ruffalo, Tim Robbins, Focus Feature's James Shamus, Nancy Meyers and John Goldwyn mingle. Adorable \nHallie Steinfeld is there with her parents. I am trying to fix her up with Justin Bieber. She giggles, \n\"Peg, I am only 14.\" \nHunky Josh Brolin tells me he is coming to New York in March to shoot two new films. He is working on \nproducing and starring in \"The Hunchback of Notre Dame\" with Tim Burton as a future project. \nI am now inches away, face to face with Harrison Ford and stupidly tell him I love him in \"Morning \nGlory\". He is looking at me in utter disbelief and I will not shut up. A gorgeous guy is also inches away \nin a hat, glasses, jacket, layered sweater and scarves. I whisper to Harrison, \"That looks just like \nJohnny Depp.\" Harrison rolls his eyes and reluctantly introduces me to his friend Johnny Depp. I babel a \nbit about his great work and run for cover to a corner next to my buddy, Jerry Bruckheimer. Jerry \nintroduces me to the wives, Vanessa Paradis and Calista Flockhart I bore them with girly chit-chat and \nrealize it's time to get out of there. \nI head over to the CAA/Bryan Lourd \"Friday Night Party\". Torrential rains and horrific winds cause a \ntraffic jam that makes it impossible to get near the house. Cell phones do not work. The world's most \nfamous faces cower under black umbrellas and make a run for it. \nBryan Lourd and Bruce Bozzi receive friends at the door all night. Inside Uma tells me she finally moved \ninto a doorman building in New York after being terrorized by stalkers for years. Talented, Ben Walker \ntalks about \"Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter\" he is about to shoot as his fiancé Mamie Gummer looks sexy \nshivering in a white satin gown. Producer Jon Kilik mentions he oversees a new cut of Julian Schnabel's \n\"Miral\" to be released in March. Bennett Miller, standing with Kristin Gore says Sony loves his new film \n\"Moneyball\" and Brad Pitt is terrific. (When is Brad Pitt not terrific?) Sandy Gallin tells me he has an \nactual job decorating Jeffrey Katzenberg's home and he has never been happier. I congratulate Barry \nLevinson's son, Sam, a director, for winning the writing award at Sundance for his first film, \"Another \nHappy Day\" which is inspired by his family. \nAlso seen floating around are, Taylor Swift and Jake Gyllenhaal, but not together, Sean Penn, Tom Curise \nand Katie Holmes, Anderson Cooper, Hilary Swank, Kelly Ripa, Carrie Fisher, Bruce Weber, Sean Combs, Paul \nHaggis, Marisa Tomei, Jay Roach, Kate Beckinsale, Demi Moore and Ashton Kutcher, Kate Hudson, Gerard \nButler, Leo DiCaprio and Bar Refaeli, Renee Zellweger with Bradley Cooper, Biutiful director Alejandro \nGonzalez-Inarritu, Kathryn Bigelow and Mark Boal, Ellen Barkin who is headed to Broadway in \"The Normal \nHeart\" this spring and CAA's Kevin Huvane, Richard Lovett and Hylda Queally. \nBusy Bruce Cohen who is producing Sunday's awards broadcast tries to get his car to leave. Limo lock is \nat a standstill. Nothing is moving outside. Two hundred swells become party prisoners and resign to just \nhaving an absolute ball till 5:00am. Once again, this is the most star studded party in town. \nSaturday, February 26th, 2011 \nThe sun comes up and dries up all the land. IAC chairmen and owner of The Newsweek/Daily Beast Barry \nDiller and his designer wife Diane Von Furstenberg host their annual lunch for Graydon Carter in their \nColdwater Canyon home. Barry introduces me to his star guest, Governor Jerry Brown, just elected to his \nthird (nonconsecutive) term as California Governor. Diane's children, Alex and Tatiana, along with their \nchildren comprise three generations of guests, which makes this party so special. \nLike last year, enormous clear plastic tents are erected on the hill near the house. Long wooden picnic \ntables covered with yellow flowers sit on oriental rugs, covering the soggy ground. Terrines of hot soup, \nplatters of sausages, fried chicken and salads are beautifully arranged on an endless buffet. Everyone \nwears winter clothes; comfy sweaters and sensible shoes. I arrive in a fur coat. \nBarry and Diane's loyal friends have been coming to this party for over fifteen years. Everybody knows \neverybody and it doesn't matter if you have a hit film or TV show this season. Oprah Winfrey kisses David \nGeffen, casually chats with former Disney CEO Michael Eisner and current Sony chief Sir Howard Stringer. \nBrett Ratner arrives with his house guest Jean Pigozzi who is allowed to photograph everyone. Graydon \ngreets people with wife Anna and Fran Lebowitz by his side. \nIngrid Sischy and Sandy Brant, Rupert Murdoch, Ron Meyer, Bryan Lourd Francesco Clemente with his twin \nboys and Tom Ford chat each other up. People watching include the pregnant Victoria and David Beckham \nwith Lynn Wyatt, Liv Tyler, Vincent Gallo, Eva Longoria, Larry Gagosian and Shala Monroque, Ben \nSilverman, Debbie and Allen Grubman, Tobias Meyer and Mark Fletcher and Stephen Gaghan and Mini Mortimer \nwearing her oversized cat glasses. \nBruce Cohen has invited me to the Oscar broadcast rehearsal. This is a special honor. There are metal \nbarricades leading up to the credentials trailer. High-tech security includes photos and computer \nbackground checks. The only thing they don't do is pat me down and ask for fingerprints. Once inside the \nKodak Theater's massive auditorium, I find a seat next to Bruce's proud parents. I watch Josh Brolin and \nJavier Bardem come out in white dinner jackets and flub their lines as they pretend to present Best \nAdapted Screenplay and Best Original Screenplay. Josh later told me at The Night Before Party that their \nacting methods are completely opposite. Josh says he is a quick study and is very creative and \ncomfortable ad-libbing. Javier, whose mother tongue is Spanish, needs to have every syllable printed out, \nwhich he studies with a dialect coach. Little wiggle room for jokes. Life size photos on large cardboard \nplaques are taped to each nominee's chair. I try to memorize their location, so when I return Sunday I \ncan quickly kiss them all. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 029775 \nBack at the Beverly Hills hotel, I slip into my gorgeous black tulle Dennis Basso cocktail dress with a \nplunging neck line and put on my mother's jewels. Jim Coleman takes me the Night Before Party in the \nhotel. This is Jeffrey Katzenberg's, 9th Annual A-lister event benefiting The Motion Picture & Television \nFund where they raise $6.5 million dollars in one night. I walk right into Valentino who gives me the \nonce over and approves my outfit. I tell him and Giancarlo Giammetti that Woody Allen's new film, \n\"Midnight in Paris\" is opening the Cannes Film Festival and they must bring the yacht. Woody is also \nfilming all summer in Rome and I am counting on them to entertain him. \nElton John and David Furnish join our conversation and of course we ask for intimate details about the \nnew baby. Elton says this is the first time they have been away from him for more than a night and they \nare delirious with parenthood. I segway over to Amy Adams who mentions she also hates leaving her baby in \nthe hotel room. I tell her she's acted like a lady with all the attention showered on Melissa Leo and \nthat someday soon she will win an Oscar because she consistently hands in amazing performances and \neverybody loves her. Next stop is Kate Capshaw in a black bowler hat chatting with Steven Spielberg's \ngod-daughter Gwyneth Paltrow. Kate gushes as she talks about her two grandchildren from daughter Jessica. \nI have known Steven since \"I Wanna Hold Your Hand\". In 1982, as a young publicist on \"E.T.\" I moved to \nCalifornia to work for him as one of his thirteen assistants. I now tell him I'm going to Broadway \nopening of \"War Horse\" with Kathy Kennedy and Frank Marshall and cannot wait to see his movie version. He \nis wildly excited about the film. I beg him to work on it. \nI meet sweet Jennifer Aniston, her new hair cut and her perfect little body. Her date tells me her secret \nis a half hour on the treadmill every day. Somehow I think that's an understatement. I tell Jesse \nEisenberg I was on his plane home from the Baftas last week. He was hiding under his hoodie and I knew \nnot to bother him. He said innocently, \"You should have said 'Hello'. I always cover my head because I \nthink my curls make me look like a girl\". \nThe charity gives us a coupon booklet redeemable at various booths for cheap clothing, new iPads, make-\nup, chocolates, shampoo and a $50 dollar Arch gift card for free McDonalds hamburgers. A bargain is a \nbargain, rich people run around like lunatics, collecting gifts for their housekeepers. Among the \nshoppers are Steven and Heather Mnuchin, Viacom's Deborah and Philippe Dauman, Tamara Mellon, Christine \nTaylor and Ben Stiller, Cate Blanchette, Susan and Robert Downey,Jr., and Debra and Hugh Jackman. \nNext stop is The Weinstein Company's Pre-Oscar party at the Soho House, sponsored by MontBlanc, \ncelebrating their new charity partnership and $1 million dollar donation to the Princess Grace \nFoundation-USA. Long gone are the funky Miramax Saturday night parties where nominees spoofed their own \nfilms in homemade costumes and ad-libbed hilarious skits. Grown men would dress as Anna Paquin and play \nthe piano in hopes of winning a Max Award. \nThere is social anxiety at the Soho House garage entrance. Guests patiently wait as super stars whisk by. \nA four hundred pound gorilla refuses to let me on the elevator until I spot Benny Medina. Once on, I see \nthe radiant Jennifer Lopez in the corner and remind her we met on Len Blavatnik's yacht in Cannes. She \ngraciously pretends to know me. Her manager, Benny Medina is kicking me. \nI slip into Colin Firth's booth by the front bar to have a tete-a-tete with him and his wife Livia \nGiuggioli about tomorrow night. Jokingly, I suggest when he wins to say, \"I'm speechless\". Colin \npatiently assures me many people, far more clever than I, have already mentioned this. He then says that \nothers are waging bets on whether he might subconsciously stutter. I grill him about his wardrobe, \nassuming he will be wearing a new Tom Ford tuxedo. He tells me both he and Ford will be in older models \nas Ford only designs classics. I tell him I made director Charles Ferguson, front runner for the \nfinancial documentary \"Inside Job\" spend $6,000 dollars last week for a new Tom Ford tuxedo. \nIn the back room Jennifer Lopez is now seated with Weinstein's wife Georgina Chapman. Nominee Helena \nBonham Carter, her husband Tim Burton and her mother Elena circulate. Celebs have now drifted over from \nThe Night Before Party. The star power includes Adrien Brody, Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen, Cameron Diaz, \nCamilla Belle, Chace Crawford, Claire Danes and Hugh Dancy, Darren Aronofsky, Emma Stone, Jaime Foxx, \ndirector John Wells, Kerry Washington, Piers Morgan, Rachel Zoe, Russell Simmons, Sean Parker, Sir Ben \nKingsly, Zack Braff , Michelle Williams and Leonardo Dicaprio with Bar Rafaeli. \"Speech\" filmmakers are \nfunctioning on high anxiety. \nSunday, February 27th, 2011 \nProducer Donna Gigliotti is my date to the awards. We are both so nervous we arrive at the Kodak Theater \nat 3:00pm and nobody is there. We are driven around for an hour. When we arrive at the world's most \nfamous red carpet, I guide Donna through the extreme right security check-in to make sure we mingle with \nthe nominees and get on camera. I teach her the red carpet hustle which is five steps forward, three \nsteps back and one inch behind a couture-clad nominee. We greet Bryan Lourd as Sandra Bullock is talking \nto ABC-TV and a billion people see me wearing a black Marchesa gown. Five steps forward, three steps \nback, we next meet Gwyneth Paltrow. As I hook up the back of her dress another billion people see us \ncorrecting a fashion malfunction. Once again, five steps forward and three steps back. We are now posing \nfor the still cameras between Nicole Kidman and Keith Urban. Our handbags begin buzzing. Countless \nfriends are e-mailing us that they just saw us on television. \nJames Franco and Anne Hathaway are hip and energetic hosts. The film montages are always the best and the \nset looks great. This is the year of no surprises. Sorkin, Seidler, Christian Bale, Melissa Leo, Natalie \nPortman and Colin Firth are totally prepared to receive the gold. Tom Hooper's win leads into Best \nPicture. Harvey is now sitting in Spielberg's seats as Spielberg announces the win. Six months of \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 029776 \ngrueling work have finally paid off. King George VI and Harvey Weinstein now share the journey of a \nsingle man who triumphs over adversity. \nThe Governor's ball, held above the Kodak Theater, recreates the Mocambo-Ciro's niteries of the 1930's \nand 40's, using a palette of teal and white. Three bands alternate musical styles as hungry guests wolf \ndown Wolfgang Puck's delicious food. The winners triumphantly sachet around the room holding their heavy \neight pound gold statues. \nAn hour later there is a migration to the famous Vanity Fair party hosted by Graydon Carter at the Sunset \nTower Hotel owned by Jeff Klein. One celebrity after another poses in front of the green hedge standing \nin the middle of the circular Vanity Fair logo to record their devotion and support to Graydon and the \nmagazine. \nThere's a hierarchy of arrival times. The inner circle of Graydon's 150 best friends attend a seated \ndinner and viewing of the show at 5pm. They include Barry Diller and Diane Von Furstenberg, Francis Ford \nCoppola, Jon Hamm and Jennifer Westfeldt, Betsey Bloomingdale, Tory Burch and Lyor Cohen, Tom Ford, Sandy \nGallin, Mitch Glazer and Kelly Lynch, Carolina and Reinaldo Herrera, L'Wren Scott and Sir Mick Jagger, \nNaomi Watts and Live Schreiber, Wendi Stark, Judd Apatow, Jackie and Joan Collins, George Hammilton, \nDonna Karan and Steve Martin. \nThe best and the brightest talent in town arrive at 9pm. They are Justin Bieber and his date Selena \nGomez, Andrew Garfield, Jude Law, Vera Farmiga, Armie Hammer, Jennifer Lawrence, Kevin Spacey, Charlize \nTheron, Anne Hathaway, Hailee Steinfield,Taylor Hackford and Helen Mirren, Scarlett Johansson, Michelle \nWilliams, Isla Fischer and Sasha Baron Cohen, Jane Fonda after her play, \"33 Variations\", Melania and \nDonald Trump whom I introduce to David 0. Russell as The Trumpster gushes about \"The Fighter\". Donald \noffers me a ride home on his plane. He is leaving in ten minutes. Too bad James Franco didn't know \nbecause he is presently sitting on a commercial flight back to school, skipping his own after party. \nSocial standings of the rest of the guests are determined by half hour increments. Every other person \npreviously mentioned in the story is here. VF's Beth Kseniak and Matt Ullian tell me the list is cut down \nto 800 this year. \nAt 11:30pm there is another celebrity migration up the hill to Madonna manager Guy Oseary's house. One \nshould note that earlier in the evening Madonna came down the hill to pose in a risque outfit with \ndaughter Lourdes in front of the green hedge. Madonna and co-host Demi Moore are able to lure the creme \nde la creme with the promise of fabulous music, dancing and no cameras. Those reported on their dance \nfloor include Ryan Phillippe with Amanda Syedfried, who were making out all night and Phillippe's ex-wife \nReese Witherspoon and new fiancé Jim Toth. They pregnant Natalie Portman and choreographer Benjamin \nMillepied, Mick Jagger, Tom Hanks, Sean Penn, Ralph Feinnes, Mila Kunis, Cameron Diaz, Gwyneth Paltrow \nand Renee Zellweger and Bradley Cooper boogie til dawn. \nA winner's work is never done.

But to your dying day, you won’t\nbe able to look yourself in the mirror and explain why you waited for another 630\nIsraelis to die first.”\n\nHe did eventually start building it, but only in the wake of an act of terrorism\nwhich, even by the standards of this new and still-escalating intifada, was truly\nobscene. In March 2002, suicide bombers murdered 30 people, mostly elderly, as\nthey were celebrating the annual Passover Seder in a hotel dining room in Netanya.\nArik hit back two days later with Israel’s largest military operation on the West\nBank since 1967. Israeli forces retook major Palestinian towns, placed Arafat\nunder de facto siege in his headquarters in Ramallah and imposed curfews and\nclosures. In June, the government formally approved the security fence. Still,\nanother year would pass before the major part of the barrier was in place, by which\ntime some 500 Israelis had been murdered in the terror attacks. Only then did the\nnumber of casualties begin to fall.\n\nI tried to steer clear of public criticism of Arik’s government. One of the lessons\nI’d learned as Prime Minister was how easy it was to second-guess from the\noutside. No Prime Minister can act exactly as he might plan or want to. The most\nyou can do is make sure you understand and analyze the issues and follow your\ninstincts, experience and conscience to come as near as possible to doing what you\nbelieve is right. You will inevitably make mistakes and misjudgements. I certainly\ndid. At least some of the criticism I received was deserved. I was at times too\ninflexible. I tended to limit my focus to a small group of trusted aides and advisors.\nI was less good at schmoozing with — or, perhaps more importantly, delegating to —\nothers in the government or the party. I suspect it’s no coincidence that the man\nwho brought me into government in the first place was often criticized for the same\nthings. By character, instinct and experience, Rabin, too, remained less a politician\nthan a military man. Yet towards the end of his second period as Prime Minister,\nhe did get better at delegating to people around him, and creating an atmosphere\nthat encouraged teamwork, even when he knew he could not accept or act on\neverything they might suggest. During my term as Prime Minister, I was much less\ngood at that.\n\nBut another thing Yitzhak and I shared was a determination to set ourselves\nspecific goals and do everything we could to achieve them. I promised to get the\narmy out of Lebanon. With the Palestinians, I arrived in office convinced that the\nprocess begun in Oslo was both a huge opportunity and a potential dead-end.

(She spoke to me and said, \"I love Jeffrey\")'. \nThe long list of women is punctuated by regular references to Epstein's celebrity friends including \nthe business magnate Donald Trump, film producer Harvey Weinstein and magician David \nCopperfield, referred to as 'Magic David'. \nThe sheer volume of phone traffic shows the frequency of Epstein's massages, many of which were \n'erotic' and allegedly involved the abused girls. \nThe evidence is from documents confiscated by police during a criminal investigation into Epstein \nand seen yesterday by the Mail. \n<image.png> \n<image.png> \nLogs: Two of the answer phone messages. Miss Maxwell is asked, right, when a girl should give a \nmassage \nOne message left for Epstein reads: 'She is wondering if 2.30 ok cuz she needs to stay in school.' \nIt was left in February 2005 — the same year that the mother of a 14-year-old girl alerted police to \nEpstein's abuse. \nAnother note shows that 'Colleen' phoned to tell Epstein: 'Going into class — will be out in 45 min. \nLast night the Daily Mail tried to contact the people whose names and telephone numbers are \nincluded in the logs. \nOne girl named Jenny, who had left her number, hung up immediately when asked about Epstein. \nA man listed only as Darren said: 'I have no comment to make on that.' \nToday, Prince Andrew was embroiled in further controversy as it was revealed Kazakhstan had \nasked for his help in recruiting investors to the country. \nThe plea came after the former Soviet Republic's President's son-in-law had bought the Prince's \nformer marital home for £3million above the asking price. \nTimur Kulibayev paid £15million for Sunninghill Park but it has remained empty and has been \nallowed to fall into disrepair. \nLast year the Prince told Hello! magazine: 'It was like any property deal between friends.' \nYesterday he attempted to perform business as usual as he visited an East London school and met \nrail bosses in Canary Wharf \nHe steadfastly ignored questions from journalists asking whether he was an 'embarrassment to his \ncountry' and would resign from his trade ambassador role as he arrived for a briefing from \nbusiness executives at the headquarters of the £15billion train project Crossrail. \nPrince Andrew managed to sell Sunninghill Park for £3million more than the asking price \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 030225 \nRead more: http ://www. dailymail. c o .uk/news/artic le- 1364171/Females- Jeffrey-Epstein- The-\ndamning-telephone-log.html#ixzz1GBL6XKcI <http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-\n1364171/Females- Jeffrey-Epstein- The-damning- telephone-lo g.html#ixzz1GBL6XKcI > < \nhttp ://www. dailymail. c o .uk/news/artic le- 1364171/Females- Jeffrey-Epstein- The-damning-\ntelephone- log.html <http ://www. dailymail. co .uk/news/artic le- 1364171/Females- Jeffrey-Epstein-\nThe-damning-telephone-log.html> > \nFrom: Ross Gow \nSent: 10 March 2011 7:48 AM \nTo: Ross gow  \nCc: 1111> ; Ian Maxwell; Kevin Maxwell; Brian \nBasham; Gareth Thompson; \nSubject: Dai y Mai \nMail have published phone logs \nhttp ://www. dailymail. c o.uk/news/artic le- 1364171/Females- Jeffrey-Epstein- The-damning-\ntelephone- log.html <http ://www. dailymail. c o .uk/news/artic le- 1364171/Females- Jeffrey-Ep stein-\nThe-damning-te lephone- lo g.html>  <http ://www. dailymail. c o .uk/news/artic le- 1364171/F emales-\nJe ffrey-Ep stein- The-damning-telephone-log.html <http ://www. dailymail. c o .uk/news/artic le-\n1364171/F emales- Jeffrey-Epstein- The-damning- telephone- lo g.html> > \nRoss Gow \nManaging Partner \nACUITY Reputation Limited \n23 Berkeley Square \nLondon W1J 6HE \nMobile \nTel \nacuityreputation.com <http://acuityreputation.com > <http://acuityreputation.com > \nSent from my iPad \nOn 10 Mar 2011, at 07:35, Ross gow < \n> < \n> wrote: \n\"Epstein's Gulfstream flew in to RAF Marham with him and the Duke's friend Ghislaine Maxwell \non board, before they enjoyed the Duke's hospitality at the Queen's Norfolk estate 20 miles \naway....\" \nRoss Gow \nManaging Partner \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 030226 \nACUITY Reputation Limited \n23 Berkeley Square \nLondon W1J 6HE \nMobile \nTel \nacuityreputation.com <http://acuityreputation.com > <http://acuityreputation.com < \nhttp://acuityreputation.com > > \nSent from my iPad \nOn 9 Mar 2011, at 22:52, Ross Gow < \n> < \n> wrote: \nDear Ghislaine \nThank you for your good-humoured patience with us and the legal team today, during what is, \nunderstandably, a testing time. \nTo confirm: \n1) I spoke to Dilenschneider in NYC at length tonight and shared strategy and role definition. \n2) we sent agreed statement to Dan Mangan ay NYPost - he's on deadline for a piece on Charlie \nSheen/Rob Lowe and seems to have moved on - for the moment. \n3) we will release statement via Press Association and PR Newswire @11.00GMT tmrw and \nfollow up with calls to those journalists who have written pieces. \nWe will create call log/matrix and advise feedback and sentiment as appropriate tmrw.

The Residence was subject to an \nAgreement between the Town of Palm Beach and the prior owner, Abraham Gosman, dated \nJanuary 31, 1990 and recorded in Official Records Book 6350, Page 1207, of the Public Records \nof Palm Beach County, Florida (\"Agreement\"). The Agreement provides that a hedge \ncontiguous to North County Road will be maintained and that in the event the hedge is damaged \nor destroyed, it will be replaced. The Agreement refers to the \"hedge\" in 9 separate places on the \nfirst page of the Agreement. The Agreement nowhere refers to, or requires, any trees. \nOn April 7, 2008 the Town gave notice of a code violation alleging that the hedge had not been \nmaintained or replaced. The original hedge had been destroyed by the hurricanes of 2005 and \ntwo subsequent replacement hedges had died due to salt spray. Therefore, Trump asked to \nreplace the ficus hedge with silver buttonwood hedge material. The Town staff advised that such \ndecision would have to be made by ARCOM. The Appellant appeared before ARCOM on May \n28, 2008. ARCOM approved silver buttonwood hedge material. ARCOM also requested that \ntrees be planted and requested a tree planting plan. Trump planted the hedge in accordance with \nthe Agreement. \nTrump returned to the Code Enforcement Board meeting on June 19, 2008. That Board deferred \nfurther consideration of the matter pending plantings requested by ARCOM. \nTrump appeared before ARCOM on June 25, 2008 and (a) sought reconsideration of \n\fJuly 3, 2008 \nPage 2 \nthe request for trees and (b) proved that the hedge that had been planted satisfactorily screened \nthe house and complied with the terms of the Agreement. \nGrounds for Appeal \nThe action of ARCOM was inconsistent with and not in conformity with the provisions of the \nCode and the Agreement which ARCOM and the Code Enforcement Board seek to enforce. The \ngrounds for appeal include the following: \n1. ARCOM erroneously interpreted the Agreement to require not only a hedge as specified \nby the Agreement, but to also require the planting of 20 trees behind the hedge. The \nAgreement does not require any planting of trees. \n2. ARCOM denied the request by Trump to reconsider its position that trees must be \nplanted. \n3. ARCOM directed that the portion of the existing hedge which was undamaged, located \nnorth of the driveway into the property, be partially or fully destroyed and replaced with \nsilver buttonwood hedge material for purposes of \"symmetry\". Such a requirement is not \nin conformity with the Agreement. \n4. ARCOM abused its discretion in denying Appellant's request since it is unreasonable to \nrequire new and additional planting outside of the clearly limited requirements of the \nAgreement. \n5. Any action by the Code Enforcement Board or ARCOM with regard to the Agreement is \nimproper and inconsistent with the Town Code since the Code Enforcement Board can \nonly enforce Code provisions and not contractual agreements, notwithstanding any \nlanguage to the contrary in the Agreement. \nTrump requests that this appeal be heard by the Town Council at the meeting on \nAugust 11,2008. \nTRUMP PR \nBy: \ncrnard Diamond, Vice President \n5434496_v I \n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

But what then, I asked. Unless we were prepared to\nresume open-ended Israeli control, we’d be left with no one to run Gaza\nafterwards. The obvious candidate, Egypt, was even less interested than we were in\nassuming responsibility for the more than one-and-a-half million Palestinians who\nlived there. I doubted that even Arafat would have been ready to do so. But\nrelations had only worsened, since his death in 2004, between the Fatah old guard\nin the Palestinian Authority on the West Bank and the Hamas overlords in Gaza. I\ndoubted very much that Abu Mazen would want to get involved. I did send an aide\nto see him to ask whether, in principle, he was open to reassuming control of Gaza\nfollowing an Israeli takeover. His answer was unsurprising and unequivocal: no.\n\nI secured cabinet support for the more limited aim of restoring a period of calm\nfor Israeli citizens in the south. I said the military operation had to be as sharp and\nshort as possible, and end with some kind of political understanding that the\nrockets would stop for a significant period of time. The final plan was presented to\nministers a few days before the operation. It would begin with surprise air strikes\nand a naval bombardment, followed by a limited ground incursion to hit remaining\nHamas targets outside of the major refugee camps, which I was determined to\navoid. The whole operation was intended to last for two weeks at the most.\nHopefully, closer to a week, with diplomatic efforts through Egypt to secure a\nlasting cease-fire and, ideally, prevent Hamas from resupplying its rocket\nstockpiles through its smuggling tunnels from the Sinai.\n\nWhen we launched Operation Cast Lead on the morning of December 27,\nnearly all the Hamas forces were where we’d expected them to be. Two waves of\nair strikes, with over a hundred jets and attack helicopters, killed 350 Hamas\nfighters. We destroyed Hamas’s headquarters and dozens of its government and\npolice installations. The attacks continued in the days that followed. We took a\nrange of actions designed to minimize civilian casualties. We dropped leaflets\nbefore bombing sorties, phoned residents, and fired light missiles before heavier\nordnance was used. Still, I realized that civilian casualties were unavoidable — if\nonly because Hamas, like Hizbollah in Lebanon, was deliberately firing its rockets\nfrom civilian areas, sometimes even near schools or hospitals. Civilian casualties\nwere obviously tragic in themselves. They also made it inevitable that the longer\nthe operation went on, the more likely we were to face international criticism, and\ndiplomatic pressure to bring it to an end. That was an additional reason I had\ninsisted that the operation be well defined and time-limited.\n\n406\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_011877\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

In the appendix, we formalize this intuition by showing that this\nequilibrium is subgame perfect, a solution concept used to rule out these kinds of concerns\nin settings where there is a high degree of rationality [15].\n\nWe might wonder whether CWOL will emerge in a population of players who are not\nrational, but are evolving or learning their strategies. There are two reasons to suspect\nit will not emerge. First, CWOL may be susceptible to the invasion of mutants. In\nparticular, the concern is that a player 2 mutant might arise that does not attend to\nwhether player 1 looks, rendering looking irrelevant. This mutant’s fitness is no higher or\nlower than the incumbent strategy, so may grow by drift. Subsequently, a player 1 mutant\nwhich looks and defects when the temptation is high would have a fitness advantage and\nproliferate. While the player 2 mutant would then start dying off since it would now have\nlower fitness than the incumbent, it is not clear that it would do so fast enough for the\nplayer 1 mutant to also die off, returning to the CWOL equilibrium. Second, CWOL may\nbe stable but have such a small basin of attraction that it will never emerge. In particular,\nthere are three other equilibria to consider, which can be seen in figure 2. The first is\ncomprised of the strategy pair where player 1 always defects, and player 2 always exits\n(which we refer to as the ALLD equilibrium). It is a Nash Equilibrium for all parameter\nvalues. The second is the strategy pair where player 2 exits if player 1 defects, and player\n\n1 cooperates with or without looking (we refer to this as the CWL equilibrium). It is a\n\nNash equilibrium when —— > cp. In fact, there are many more Nash Equilibria, where\n\n1—w —\nthe population mixes between different strategies.\n\nConsequently, we employ computer simulations of the replicator dynamic to explore\nthe evolutionary dynamics of the envelope game.

Crim. L. & Criminology 59, *96\n\nIn view of the Department's existing notifications and provision of services before charges are filed under the VRRA, it is hard\n\nto conceive how any viable claim could be made that it would be difficult to provide similar rights under the CVRA. The four\nrights that would be potentially in play before charging would be the right to reasonable protection, the right to fair treatment,\nand the right to confer with prosecutors, along with the predicate right to notice of these rights. 7!? The VRRA already requires\nthe Department to provide reasonable protection, so this would not be an expanded obligation. 7!3 Similarly, the Guidelines\nalready require prosecutors to confer with victims about plea agreements (the most common situation where victims want to\nconfer), so it is hard to imagine how extending this right would create any undue burden. 7!4 Additionally, the right to \"fair\ntreatment\" could only be a problem if the Department [*97] wanted to treat victims unfairly. Given its repeated and professed\ncommitment to crime victims, here too this obligation should not be burdensome. And finally, with regard to providing notice\nof CVRA rights to victims, the fact that the Department currently provides notice of VRRA rights indicates that it should not be\ndifficult to provide notice of CVRA rights as well.\n\nIndeed, it is possible that the Department's notification letters under the VRRA already include this information. Interestingly,\nin the Epstein case, the FBI notified Jane Doe Number One and Jane Doe Number Two that they had rights in the criminal\njustice process. As early as June 7, 2007 - more than three months before it concluded a nonprosecution agreement with\nEpstein - the U.S. Attorney's Office sent a notice to Jane Doe Number One stating \"your case is under investigation.\" *!> The\nnotice also informed Jane Doe Number One that \"as a victim and/or witness of a federal offense, you have a number of rights.\"\n716 Among the rights that the U.S. Attorney's Office told Jane Doe that she possessed was \"the reasonable right to confer with\nthe attorney for the United States in the case.\" *!7 Of course, she would not have had those rights if she was not covered by the\nCVRA. The FBI therefore apparently assumed that the CVRA already applied in the Epstein case. It was only later, when the\nmatter went into litigation, that the Department of Justice reversed course. This change in course underscores the problems\narising out of the OLC memorandum and the Department's current interpretation of the CVRA.\n\nD. STATE LAW EXTENSION OF PRE-CHARGING RIGHTS\n\nThe focus of this Article so far has been crime victims' rights in the federal system. But in concluding, it is instructive to note\nhow a number of states offer parallel rights for crime victims, including the right to confer with prosecutors. In fact, several\nstates have extended such rights prior to formally filing of charges against defendants - without reported difficulty, so far as we\nare aware. This confirms our inference that extending CVRA rights to crime victims before the formal filing of criminal\ncharges is both feasible and desirable.\n\nA general overview of state laws illustrates the broad protections afforded to victims in state criminal justice systems. Nearly\ntwo-thirds of states have adopted constitutional provisions to protect victims throughout [*98] the criminal justice process.\n218 Moreover, every state has adopted a statute that either enforces its constitutional amendment or creates independent\nstatutory rights for crime victims. *!?

L. Rev. 844, *899\n\nThis basic overview - drawn from a substantial scholarly literature - paints a somewhat contradictory picture. On the one hand,\nthe primary story is one of longstanding underenforcement - a combination of explicit legal policies, practical evidence-\ngathering and proof challenges, and cultural biases resulted in a notoriously weak response to sexual assaults by state criminal\njustice systems. On the other hand, there is a story, over the last forty years or so, of wide-ranging success in achieving reforms\non several fronts - substantive and procedural law, institutional design, and resource allocation - designed to improve\nenforcement capacity. In other words, U.S. jurisdictions made substantial progress against an ingrained tradition of\nunderenforcement without turning to any model of enforcement redundancy - federalization, private prosecution, or judicial\nreview. That is more than state justice systems were ever able to do with regard to local government corruption, where the\nremedy instead was the rise of federal criminal law enforcement.\n\nAnd yet, few seem to consider this reform story a success. !*8 The data on underreporting by victims, low arrest rates by\npolice, and charging rates by prosecutors (along with the rape kit [*900] testing backlog) make it easy to view state criminal\njustice systems as failing to achieve adequate enforcement responses to sexual assaults despite the scope and gravity of the\nproblem - 124,000 offenses reported to police in 2015, and 431,000 assault reports estimated by the National Crime Victim\nSurvey. 189\n\nThis story of reform, its decidedly limited success, and the responses to that record all reveal insights about the prospects for\nredressing underenforcement through redundancy in this context. Intersecting feminist, victim rights, and rape-law-reform\nmovements have achieved some remarkable reforms through the political process over the last four decades. U.S. criminal\njustice, like U.S. public law generally, is responsive to popular sentiment, well-organized reform movements, and interest\ngroups. !?° But these movements never sought any mechanism of enforcement redundancy, and federal and state lawmakers\nnever seriously considered one. Even now, when offense definitions, victim rights, evidentiary rules, and organizational\nchanges in law enforcement agencies offer few plausible options for further improvement, there is effectively no sign of\ninterest in private prosecution and judicial or administrative oversight. Instead, the sole focus of further innovation to address\nendemic underenforcement of sexual assault offenses is the federal government. And most federal policy - and policy proposals\n- stop short of expanding federal law to cover sexual assaults now within the jurisdiction solely of state courts. !°! A notable\n\nD4 Linda R.S. v.

But there's one phrase\nI absolutely love: \"predicament bondage.\" Predicament bondage is usually presented in a\nvery elaborate way: for example, a submissive might be tied up with ropes binding him\nsuch that his arms are in pain -- but if he moves his arms then his legs will be in pain. It's\na predicament! And it's bondage! Whee! Predicament bondage!\n\nHowever, it doesn't have to be elaborate to be predicament bondage. I'm not into rope\nobstacle courses, but I started loving the phrase \"predicament bondage\" after a friend\nwent to a workshop run by Fetish Diva Midori and reported back. He said:\n\nMidori had two pitchers of water, or maybe a pitcher and a glass. She told us, \"This is\nthe simplest form of predicament bondage,\" and she had the demo submissive hold his\nhands straight out at shoulder height. Then she placed the water in his hands. The\nsubmissive had to keep holding the water; if he failed, he knew he would be failing\nMidori. But there was never any threat of \"Midori's wrath\" if he failed her. In fact, she\nspoke as if she was on his side, part of his team. In many ways, her sympathy for his\nplight made it all the more cruel, because she was the one doing it to him.\n\nShe explained this. She knew that his sense of disappointment in \"failing” her was worse\nthan anything she could actually do to him.\n\nSo, the predicament in that case was the submissive's increasing arm agony vs. his fear of\nfailing Midori. For me, that concept is infinitely hotter than a rope obstacle course.\nAlthough for me, in practice, I'd also want the pain to be a bit more... um... personal.\n\nte Ok ok\n\nThe first time someone flogged me, I had no idea what he was going to do beforehand; he\nand I had the strongest dominant/submissive dynamic I've ever felt, and I put myself in\nhis hands with almost-total trust. A night came around when I felt that itch under my\nskin, the dark burn in the back of my mind... I knew I had to go see him. I wasn't hugely\nexperienced, but I knew exactly what that slow burn meant.\n\nIt was late. He was in bed, and I lay down next to him. \"I think...\" I said slowly, \"I want\nyou to hurt me. A lot.\"\n\nI felt him tense beside me.\n\"Why?\" he asked.\nI didn't look at him. \"Why do you ask me questions when you already know the answer?”\n\n\"Sometimes I just want to hear you say it,\" he said, and stood up. \"Take off your clothes\nand get on your knees.”\n\nI caught my breath; did as he said. When I felt the ends of the flogger trail lightly down\nmy back, I wasn't even sure what the soft sensation meant, but I was already trembling\nanyway. I am surprised by my memory of how much it hurt when he hit me. These days,\nI don't think of floggers as especially painful, but then again, I seem to recall that he left\nmore marks than I'm used to. (I loved taking off my shirt and examining the bruises in the\nmirror. I glowed for days, afterwards.) So maybe there was something particular about\nwhat he did, or about his materials. Or maybe it's just that it was my first time.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_018635\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

This report is intended for jake.byrne@baml.com\n\nHess Corp.\nInflection point: adding Hess to BofAML’s\n\nUS 1 ‘best ideas’ list\n\nReiterate Rating: BUY | PO: 80.00 USD | Price: 49.97 USD\n\nShort interest ratio: catalyst for recovery\n\nOver the past six months Hess has been one of the most volatile stocks in the sector, facing\nheadwinds from a significant increase in short interest that has exaggerated volatility. From\ndiscussions with investors, the arguments against Hess seem to begin and end with a\ncombination of declining production and an expanding balance sheet — all part of the\ndeliberate portfolio choices that favored completing major projects at the expense of short\ncycle production. We expect this to end in 2Q17 with a rebound in oil and gas production\nstarting in 2H17 and critically, an inflection in free cash flow that we expect will return Hess\nto free cash flow with the flexibility to re-up investment in the Bakken. We thus would view\nHess as a dangerous ‘short’ for investors seeking to hedge other portfolio risks.\n\nInflection point on multiple levels right around the corner\n\nWe believe Hess’ investment case is approaching an inflection point on multiple levels.\nWe expect oil and gas production to trough in 2Q17, with a rebound of 60,000 boepd or\n22%, by 4Q17 marking the single biggest sequential change in production of any\ncompany in the sector. This is likely to kickstart an extended period of growth in\n2018/19 but with the contribution from Guyana driving a step change in Hess’ growth\ntrajectory through 2025. Near term, we think Hess is also poised for an inflection in free\ncash flow that is reasonably $1bn annualized, with $700mm irrespective of oil prices.\nVersus consensus operating cash flow of ~$1.9bn in 2017, this stands out as the biggest\nswing in free cash of any company in the sector.\n\nAdding Hess to US 1 ‘best ideas’ list\n\nAfter a year of waiting, we believe the inflection point in Hess’ investment case is just around\nthe corner, with the broader sector pullback positioning the shares with amongst the highest\nupside in the sector as implied by our price objectives. At current levels, Hess ‘discounts’ strip\noil prices. Under our base case, which assumes a rebound in oil prices towards $70 from 2020\nfair value is reasonably ~$80 per share. If non-producing asset value from Guyana is included\nwe estimate this would be closer to $90. BofAML’s US1 list is a collection of the firm’s best\ninvestment ideas managed with the goal of providing superior investment performance over\nthe long term. For Hess, we believe the combination of catalysts, short interest and absolute\nvalue can drive a period of strong relative outperformance vs peers. For this reason, Hess\nreplaces DVN as the energy stock on BofAML’s US 1 list.\n\nEstimates (Dec)\n\n(USS) 2015A 2016A 2017E 2018E 2019E\nEPS (3.92) (4.94) (3.75) (1.46) (0.76)\nGAAP EPS (10.77) (19.92) (3.75) (1.46) (0.76)\nEPS Change (YoY) NM -26.0% 24.1% 61.1% 47.9%\nConsensus EPS (Bloomberg) (3.03) (2.09) (0.45)\nDPS 1.00 1.00 1.00 1.00 1.00\n\nValuation (Dec)\n2015A 2016A 2017E 2018E 2019E\n\nPIE NM NM NM NM NM\nGAAP P/E NM NM NM NM NM\nDividend Yield 2.0% 2.0% 2.0% 2.0% 2.0%\nEV / EBITDA* 17.2x NM 9 9x 6.4x 5 Ax\nFree Cash Flow Yield* -13.2% 81% 3.8% -0.3% 3.17%\n\n* For full definitions of ‘Qnethod™ measures, see page 11.\n\nBofA Merrill Lynch does and seeks to do business with issuers covered in its research reports.

The\nprotesters and terrorists understood power that existed simply because of\nconnectivity. They understood how easy it was to connect. And so they had an\ninstinct that eluded the comfortable men in the palaces. The usual reaction of\nauthorities - Round up the usual suspects - didn’t work because, as Castells noted,\n“The usual suspects were networks.” You couldn’t arrest a network.\n\n3\n\nBefore we can go much further in figuring out how network power might be used -\nto close up those six worrisome paradoxes, to create massive new companies (or\ninvest in them), to rebuild our politics —- ] think we need a picture of sorts in our\nheads of this new landscape. What does a network look like? How does it’s design\naffect its operation? Yes, it’s true you can’t arrest a network. But can you say\nsomething about howit’s different? Can you spot the parts that are dangerous?\nWhen someone like Castells says to us, “Power is moving,” what does that mean\nexactly? Where is it going? What I want to do now is begin to assemble an image of a\nnetwork, and to show what that sort of linked design tells us about where we are\nnow and where we're going. Then, with such a picture, firmly in our minds, we can\nask just what these networks are for, after all, and how they might be used.\n\nIt is an old chestnut of historians and anthropologists that power - the ability to\nmake or cause things to happen - is often determined by structure. When | say,\n“Superpower” | am painting a picture of the international system with a single word.\n“Highway,” does the same - and tells you something about logistics, trucks,\neconomic power. Or “City.” This is why “org charts” have such a decisive power.\nThink of the map of power in your family or your office or a nation. Who makes the\ndecisions? Why? The way we bottle up our lives in firms or congresses or\nuniversities flavors just about every other decision we make®®. An imperial CEO,\nprone to visions and control creates a different sort of firm than a boss who moves\namong his employees nearly as an equal. An army that moves from the top down is\ndifferent than one that lives, as Mao said of the Chinese guerilla forces that mastered\nthe country against steep odds in 1949, “as if they were fish and the people were\nwater.” Power is always packed into structures of some sort. Emperors, kings,\npresidents and congresses all reflect certain arrangements. But those arrangements\nchange; power moves. You can see leaders struggle with this constant shifting:\nThink of the “Englightened Despotism” of the 18 Century as Frederick II of Prussia,\nJoseph II of the Hapsburgs and Catherine IJ in St. Petersburg each struggled to marry\nthe then-new ideas of liberty with older instincts of control. History is, in one sense,\nnothing but the tale of the movement of power. Once the idea of an Assyrian king\nemperor was new, as was the notion of a President or a Pope. History is paced by\nthe arrival of new species of all sorts; and by the death of others. This is as true for\ninstitutions as is it for bugs. With this caveat: No one gives up power easily.\n\n88 The way we: See Venkatesh Rao, “The Amazing, Shrinking Org Chart”, on\nRibbonfarm.com, May 28, 2015\n\n65\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_018297\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

Just to tell Dan Shomron that\nyou’ve been taken out of the operation.”\n\nTo say I was surprised would be an understatement. But I allowed myself to\nbelieve the decision to “take me out” could still be reversed. Not only was I\nready to command the critical first part of the operation. I believed I was best\nplaced to ensure it succeeded. I felt that was best for Yoni, too, due to tensions\ninside the sayeret of which both of us were aware.\n\nThere was no officer to whom I was closer than Yoni. He had extraordinary\nstrengths as a soldier: in the Six-Day War, in 1973, and afterwards when, with\nmy encouragement, he’d taken command of a tank battalion in the north left\nalmost in tatters from the Yom Kippur War. But there was more to him as well.\nI used to marvel how at the end of 16 hours of sayeret training, he could spend a\nfurther two or three reading history, or a novel or poetry. He always struggled\nbetween the impulse to devote his life to fighting for the State of Israel, and to\nstudying, reading and living as a more “normal” family man.\n\nHis drive to serve, and to excel, was stronger. Tuti Goodman, the young\nwoman he’d met as a teenager and married, understood what drew him to a life\nin uniform. But that wasn’t what she had signed up for. At one point, Yoni\nasked me to speak to Tuti. She asked me to speak to him. I did my best to\nexplain each to the other. But the gap between what each of them wanted for\ntheir lives was just too wide. Before the 1973 war, they’d separated. After the\nwar, professionally fulfilled but personally shattered, Yoni heard that I'd found\nan apartment in Ramat Hasharon, and he asked me if there were other flats in\nthe building. It turned out that the owner of the flat below ours was willing to\nrent it. Yoni snapped it up.\n\nOver the past year or so, with Yoni leading the sayeret and me in the kirya,\nwe’d seen more of each another. For the first time in years, he seemed to have\nfound a sense of peace, and fulfillment, in his personal life.

After a flurry of calls, Graydon arrives on set, and playing\nhimself, sashays by the table. Gekko jumps up to say hello and Graydon brushes him off with a few dismissive lines.\n\nMonday, November 9, 25 Broadway\n\nOne hundred swells show up at the former Canard Shipping building, a massive Italianate hall, at the crack of dawn for the\nAlzheimer’s Ball, a grand charity event.\n\nSusan Hess and I are chauffeured downtown with our Vera Wang gowns and report to the VIP extra holding area where we join\nPrince Dimitri of Yugoslavia in a bespoke dinner jacket, journalist Christopher Mason, songstress Yanna Avis, photographer Kelly\nKlein, art dealer Larry Gagosian's girl friend Shala Monroque in see-through Rodarte, beauty executive Olivia Chantecaille, producer\nLawrence Robins, author Jackie Weld Drake, Vogue film critic Joan Juliet Buck, fashion consultant Jill Fairchild, CNN’s Felicia\nTaylor and Italian newsman Mario Calvo-Platero.\n\nEllen Mirojnick and her costume department have assembled racks of the most expensive elaborate designer gowns and work at\nbreak neck speed styling while we wildly strip to our undies in a makeshift dressing area. Ellen pours me into a black tulle Marchesa\nwith a enormous wired silver bow. Twenty hairdressers and make-up artists systematically work on 250 extras. A mile of tables are\nalternately filled with steaming coffee, fattening breakfast foods, hair sprays, mirrors, shoes and jewelry. It’s a madhouse of\nexcitement.\n\nWe are led to the part of the set used for the cocktail reception and placed around Michael Douglas and Charlie Sheen stand-ins.\nCharlie has been flown in from LA for half a day's work to reprise his original character. He is now the highest paid television actor\ncommanding two million dollars an episode of “Two and a Half Men.”\n\nOliver arrives on the set greeting, examining, tweaking the shot and always pulling the prettiest girls closest to the\ncamera. Michael and Charlie arrive from their trailers and run their lines as socials drift into their sight lines challenging their\nconcentration on pages of dialogue. Oliver yells, \"Action\" as the extras aggressively jockey for face time. Charlie is not having an\neasy day and they do take after take. My corporate husband Chuck Pfieffer has gotten his real girlfriend Lisa Crosby in the film and\nmy marriage has become a threesome.\n\nSensing our concern of not making it onto the silver screen Oliver tells his first assistant director to seat a dinner table with\nSusan Hess, Jill Fairchild, Prince Dimitri, Chuck Pfieffer, Grace Meigher and Mario Calvo-Platero. He directs us to chat with each\nother turning left and right as the camera closely pans past our faces.\n\nElsewhere on the set are John Buffalo Mailer, as Shia's character's best friend, Austin Pendleton, 94-year-old Eli Wallach and\n\nNatalie Morales. Also in this film are: the magnificent Frank Langella, as Shia’s boss, who throws himself in front of a train early in\nthe film, Susan Sarandon as Shia’s real-estate broker mother, Sylvia Miles, who reprises her hilarious cameo as another real-estate\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_032002\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

But in the course\nof conversations I've had researching a new book on President Trump\nand the forces arrayed against him, it has become clear that Robert\nMueller and his office are already preparing for a life or death\nconfrontation with the President and the mother of all constitutional\ncrises.\n\nOver the last several months the Mueller office has prepared a\npossible indictment of the president on charges related to obstruction of\njustice and devised a legal strategy to navigate the inevitable fallout\nfrom such an indictment.\n\nMy discussions have been with both White House advisors and\npeople close to the investigation—that is, sources on both sides of the\npossible conflict. No source involved in this story would speak on the\nrecord. But in broad-strokes each side's understanding matches the\naccount provided to me by the other side.\n\nThe Special Counsel has in place a set of allegations, proposed\ncharges, and an aggressive legal theory to support the indictment of the\npresident on obstruction charges. In the last few weeks, as the President\nhas indulged his pardon authority, the Mueller team has also developed\na legal basis to oppose what the Special Counsel believes will be a likely\npardon of former National Security Advisor, Michael Flynn—who had\npreviously struck a plea bargain which could include his testimony\nagainst the President—and what it believes to be another step in the\nPresident's obstruction efforts.\n\nAt this point, the case for indictment has, in effect, a judge of one,\nsince the Mueller team must get the approval of Deputy Attorney\nGeneral Rod Rosenstein to proceed. As recently as April, Rosenstein\npublicly declared that the President was not a target, but this may have\nbeen a kind of fig leaf: technically the President does not become a\nformal target until Rosenstein agrees to designate him as one. It may\nalso illustrate a conflict between the Deputy Attorney General and the\ninvestigators he has overseen since the recusal of Attorney General Jeff\nSessions from the Russia-related investigation—though, according to\none source, Mueller believes he does have the support of his boss.\n\nThe proposed indictment would be all the more controversial\nbecause it finds the entire narrative of the case for obstruction in plain\nsight.

I am sure that affected\nthey way they related to Bruria. Even before Yoni met her, he had told me how\nhard his parents were finding his separation from Tutti. Bruria attended the\nfuneral and the sh/oshim. But she didn’t sit with the family. I think that with the\nshock of his death, mixed with the pride they felt at his emergence as a national\nhero, they found it difficult to include her, a woman they hardly knew, in their\nmourning.\n\nA few weeks later, I go a call from the Netanyahu family’s lawyer, Erwin\nShimron. It was an odd, rambling conversation. He seemed to insinuate that, as\nher and Yoni’s neighbor and friend, I was encouraging the unwelcome idea that\nBruria was part of the immediate circle of the bereaved, that this mere girlfriend\nwas somehow his widow. He wanted me to withdraw whatever mantle I might\nbe providing, and help separate her from Yoni and his legacy. He went so far as\nto say that one reason he was calling me was because he didn’t want to have to\ntake “legal steps” to make that happen. I saw no point in getting into an\nargument. I sensed that, while it would take time for the grief felt by those\nclosest to Yoni to begin to heal, the issue would gradually resolve itself. But I\nsaw even less point in leading the lawyer to believe I would do what he was\nsuggesting.\n\n“Mr Shimron,” I told him. “I knew Yoni. I know Bruria. I do not know you.\nBut I have a musical ear. I don’t like the undertone I hear in what you’ve been\nsaying. I’ve seen them close up.

In the early months, my priority was to\nensure we at least had a military option. A full year before joining Bibi’s\ngovernment, as Defense Minister under Olmert, I’d first tried to put an operational\nplan in place, only to find that the lack of heavy munitions and refuelling aircraft\nmade it impossible. That was especially frustrating because at that point, our\nexperts calculated that a successful strike could have set back the Iranian nuclear\neffort by about six years. Given the Iranians’ knowledge we could attack again,\nand their need to restart clandestine efforts to secure key components abroad, that\nmeant a very real prospect of ending the nuclear program altogether. On joining\nBibi’s government, I began working, both with the kirya and the engineers and\ntechnological experts in our military industries, to make sure we had the weaponry\nand equipment, and an operational plan for a surgical strike. It was not until mid-\n2010, a year into Bibi’s government, that I was confident we’d reached that point,\nin part thanks to Israeli-produced heavy bombs and tanker aircraft. Our experts\nestimated we would still be able to set back the Iranian nuclear efforts by up to\nfour years, almost certainly enough to end them indefinitely.\n\nYet making military action possible proved to be the easy part. The question\nnow became whether we should be prepared to launch a strike against Iran’s\nnuclear facilities. Answering it was like a contest of three-dimensional chess,\ninvolving both an internal debate among Israel’s political and military leadership\nand discussions with an Obama administration whose priority remained to\nnegotiate an end to Iran’s nuclear program. On major security decisions in Israel,\ntwo ministers always mattered the most: the Prime Minister and Defense Minister.\nNeither Bibi nor I doubted we had to ready to strike if that proved necessary. Nor\ndid Foreign Minister Lieberman. Even for us, it was an option to be considered\nonly when all other ways to rein in the Iranians were failing. We also agreed on\ntwo other preconditions. We would have to secure international legitimacy, most of\nall from the Americans, for what would be a clear act of self-defense. And we’d\nneed to demonstrate an imperative urgency to act, with the approach of the “zone\nof immunity” that would take any military option off the table for good.\n\nIdeally, we hoped the US-led campaign of economic and diplomatic pressure\nwould get Iran to abandon its nuclear ambitions, as Libya had done in the wake of\n\n417\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_011888\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

So is China. And Russia. And these may not even be the most dangerous or\ndevastating network battles that will take place in our lives. It’s a commonplace to\nsay now that the international system is in the greatest period of upheval in more\nthan half a century. But often this sort of remark is accompanied by a list of moving\npieces that seem to be unconnected: China’s rise, the return of Russia, changes in the\nMiddle East, globalization and then reverse globalization. “Who would have thought\nthe post Cold War era, which was supposed to be characterized by ‘softpower’ and\neconomic interdependence would be so violent?”®* one team of scholars recently\nwrote, reflecting the genuine wonderment of many “experts” who failed to predic\nthe end of the Cold War and then, largely, the nature of what has come after. Who\nwould have thought? Well, as we'll see, anyone who understands networks.\n\nThomas Hobbes - the 16 century British philosopher long considered an early\nmaster of the analysis of cold, brutal power - once put it simply enough: Nations, he\nsaid, need to be mastered. “During the time men live without a common power to\nkeep them all in awe, they are in that condition which is called war,” he wrote. “Such\na war as is of every man against every man.”°’ A precondition of peace, for Hobbes,\nwas that some country or force or tribe decisively grips a region, an empire, even\nthe globe. “A common power to keep them all in awe,” fulfilled a need for order. In\nour connected age, the common, awesome power is already here. It is networks. The\nbattle now is for and on of this genuinely historic, still curious force. They will be\nattacked, throttled, trashed, accelerated, used, upgraded, won and lost and inflicted\non each of us and our security by those with a new sensibility. To feel the world with\na Seventh Sense will reveal a whole new landscape of power; it will permit us to see\nthe fibers of a new age and then weave them into how we see and think and, finally,\nact. That essential, decisive terrain of our new age is, to the “Smart Power” and\n“Don’t Come Home” crowd, still largely invisible and, anyhow, incomprehensible.\n\n7.\n\nJust as rivers or mountains or air currents drove commerce and combat in past eras,\nnetworks will strongly, probably decisively, influence the dynamics ahead. Today\nyou can’t, after all, operate on the rivers or mountains or in the skies or space\nwithout lively, near-instant connection. The space these interlocking networks\noccupy represents a new geography. It is growing every day, as if it were a giant new\ncontinent fusing together under the surface of the sea. We are, as the team at Gee!\nDo! discovered, moving from a world in which nations battled nations to one in\nwhich nations battle networks. And a world where networks battle networks.

A wide variety of functional links involving neuronal\npacemakers has been demonstrated.

On November 1*, I still had not been able\nto make contact with Anatoly Kucherena, and my flight back to New York was in five days. My\nfixer, Zamir, had been trying to arrange an appointment for three weeks but he had only received\none call back from Kucherena’s assistant, Valentina Vladimirovna Kvirvova. She wanted to know\nhow I knew Oliver Stone. He told her of my part in Stone’s movie Wall Street 2: Money Never\nSleeps. That was the last he had heard from her. Meanwhile a Moscow based journalist told me\nthat she had waited 18 months to hear back from him giving up. I also learned from a Russian\nresearcher that Kucherena had not given a single interview to any journalist since his television\ninterview with Sophie Shevardnadze on September 23, 2013. And no Russian journalist, or any\nMoscow-based foreign journalist, had ever obtained an interview with Snowden. At this point,\nZamir was becoming increasingly doubtful about getting my access to either Kucherena or\nSnowden.\n\nBut I had another contact in Moscow. When I had been investigating the 2006 Polonitum\npoisoning of ex-KGB officer Alexander Litvinenko in London, I had interviewed a number of\npeople in Moscow, including Andrei Lugovoy. A former KGB officer assigned to protecting the\nKremlin’s top members in the 1990s, Lugovoy later opened his own security company. In 2005,\nhe became a business associate of Litvinenko’s in gathering information, and made regular trips to\nLondon to meet with him. Since he had tea with Litvinenko at the Millennium hotel in London\non November 1, 2006, the day Litvinenko was poisoned, he became the main suspect in the\nBritish investigation.

Pointing to\nthe $60 million allegedly made on the film, Steinem characterized Deep Throat as “a national and\ninternational profit center and dirty joke.” At the heart of the joke was Linda Lovelace “whose\ninnocent face offered movie-goers the titillating thought that even the girl-next-door might be the\nobject of porn-style sex.” But, according to Steinem, it was a joke with widely felt consequences:\n“Literally millions seem to have been taken to Deep Throat by their boyfriends or husbands (not\nto mention prostitutes by pimps) so that each one might learn what a woman could do to please a\nman if she really wanted to.”\n\nMoreover, Linda Lovelace was now claiming that her innocent face had been a mask covering up\na battered wife who had been imprisoned by her husband-pimp. Several years after the\ncompletion of Deep Throat was completed, Lovelace wrote an autobiography entitled Ordeal, in\nwhich she told a sordid story of how she had been compelled to perform her “sexual sword-\nswallower trick” at gunpoint.\n\nAfter reading Ordeal I called Reems and asked him whether his recollections of the filming of\nDeep Throat corroborated her claim that she had been forced into performing. Harry, who was\nthen working off-Broadway in a stage play, laughed and said, “Are you kidding? Sure her\nhusband, Chuck, was an asshole, but he was hardly around during the filming. Damiano sent him\naway because he would get jealous of how much she was enjoying the sex. She was really into it.\nWe had a good relationship before and during the filming.”\n\nI told Harry that Lovelace had written that when “she saw how upset Chuck was, [she] decided\n[she] would pretend to enjoy it with Harry.” I asked whether it was possible that she was only\nacting.\n\n“Linda Lovelace acting?” Harry exclaimed. “Have you seen her in a film? She couldn’t even\npretend to be acting.”\n\nWhether true or false, Lovelace’s account struck a responsive chord among many feminists.\nGloria Steinem’s article presented a sympathetic portrait of Lovelace as the victim of everything\nthe “sleazy pornocrats” had come to represent. Using Lovelace’s Ordeal as a symbol of sexist\nrepression, many feminists declared all-out war against pornography. The movie Deep Throat\ncame to symbolize the anti-women evils of the sex industry. And I became the symbol of the\n“pornocrat lawyer,” getting rich off the suffering of exploited women (even though I charged\nnothing for these cases).\n\nThe organization through which Gloria Steinem spoke—Women Against\nPornography—advocated boycotts as its primary weapons in the war on porn. The boycotts were\ndirected not only against theaters and bookstores, but against lawyers who represented them on\nFirst Amendment grounds. When I and several friends opened a Kosher deli in Harvard Square, it\nwas picketed with signs of saying “How can a porn pig serve Kosher food?”\n\nAlthough boycotts are themselves protected by the constitutional right of free expression, civil\nlibertarians are appropriately concerned about the effect of overly broad boycotts, such as those\n\n111\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_017198\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

If they wanted to eat the marshmallow, they only had to ring\nthe bell. But, as Mischel informed them, if they waited for his return, he would bring them more\nmarshmallows. Mischel took out his stopwatch and recorded how long each child waited before ringing\nthe bell.\n\nSome children rang the bell almost immediately, leaving Mischel no time to leave the room.\nOthers waited. This isn’t surprising. Some children are impulsive, others are impatient, and this shows up\nearly in life. What is surprising is that these early appearing personality types held steadfast, impacting\nlater life decisions and actions. The more impatient types were more likely to be involved in juvenile\ndelinquency, have poor grades, abuse drugs, get divorced, and lose their jobs. For women who developed\neating disorders, those who were more patient were more likely to be anorexic, whereas those who were\nmore impulsive were more likely to be bulimic. When the American developmental psychologist B.J.\nCasey put these now 40-somethings inside a brain scanner, the patient ones showed stronger activation in\nthe prefrontal areas of the brain when viewing happy and fearful faces, revealing stronger self-control\nover their feelings. In contrast, when the impatient ones viewed the same stimuli, not only was there a\nweaker response in the prefrontal region but a stronger response in the ventral striatum when viewing\nhappy faces. The striatum, as noted earlier, is involved in the experience of reward. For the impatient\ntypes, seeing something positive is like eating candy, something that is hard to ignore. The patient types\nregulate this feeling, transforming the heat of the moment into a cool experience. The impatient types are\noverwhelmed by this feeling, giving into temptation. This work adds to the genetic evidence reviewed\nearlier, showcasing both the importance of individual differences in self-control, and the stability of these\ndifferences as distinctive personality types.\n\nIndividual differences in self-control are also relevant to levels of recidivism in youths who have\ncommitted a crime, and thus tie us back to the beginning of this chapter and the costs of a career criminal.\nCareer criminals are individuals who repeatedly commit crimes. They lack self-control. This is important\nfor judges, juries and society as we want to know in advance who is most likely to commit another crime\nif we release them back out onto the streets. The American sociologist Matt DeLisi presented a self-\ncontrol survey to approximately 800 juvenile youths, ages 12-17 years, each with a criminal record.\nThose who scored one standard deviation from the mean on this survey, and thus were more impulsive\nthan most, were five times more likely to become career criminals. Five times. Self-control on its own\naccounted for about 80% of the variation in recidivism among these delinquents; the remaining 20% was\naccounted for by factors that one might think would be much more important, including mental health,\neducation, gender, and socioeconomic background. As DeLisi concludes, these results suggest that\n\nmeasures of self-control provide a reliable predictor of the likelihood of repeating a crime. They provide a\n\nHauser Chapter 4.

G \n, Fred Simon \nThe problems we face today are there because the people who \nwork for a living are outnumbered by those who vote for a  \nWe Are Not Coming Back \nPlease take a moment to digest this provocative article by a \nJewish Rabbi from Teaneck, N.J. \nIt is far and away the most succinct and thoughtful  \nexplanation of how our nation is changing. The article \nappeared in The Israel National News, and is directed to \nJewish readership. 70% of American Jews vote as Democrats. \nThe Rabbi has some interesting comments in that regard. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 031699 \nRabbi Steven Pruzansky is the spiritual leader of \nCongregation Bnai Yeshurun in Teaneck, New Jersey \n\"The most charitable way of explaining the election results of 2012 is that Americans voted \nfor the status quo - for the incumbent President and for a divided Congress. They must enjoy \ngridlock, partisanship, incompetence, economic stagnation and avoidance of responsibility. \nAnd fewer people voted. \nBut as we awake from the nightmare, it is important to eschew the facile explanations for the \nRomney defeat that will prevail among the chattering classes. Romney did not lose because \nof the effects of Hurricane Sandy that devastated this area, nor did he lose because he ran a \npoor campaign, nor did he lose because the Republicans could have chosen better \ncandidates, nor did he lose because Obama benefited from a slight uptick in the economy \ndue to the business cycle. \nRomney lost because he didn't get enough votes to win. \nThat might seem obvious, but not for the obvious reasons. Romney lost because the \nconservative virtues - the traditional American virtues — of liberty, hard work, free enterprise, \nprivate initiative and aspirations to moral greatness - no longer inspire or animate a majority \nof the electorate. \nThe simplest reason why Romney lost was because it is impossible to compete against free \nstuff. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 031700 \nEvery businessman knows this; that is why the \"loss leader\" or the giveaway is such a \npowerful marketing tool. Obama's America is one in which free stuff is given away: the adults \namong the 47,000,000 on food stamps clearly recognized for whom they should vote, and so \nthey did, by the tens of millions; those who - courtesy of Obama - receive two full years of \nunemployment benefits (which, of course, both disincentivizes looking for work and also \nmotivates people to work off the books while collecting their windfall) surely know for whom \nto vote. The lure of free stuff is irresistible. \nThe defining moment of the whole campaign was the revelation of the secretly-recorded video \nin which Romney acknowledged the difficulty of winning an election in which \"47% of the \npeople\" start off against him because they pay no taxes and just receive money - \"free stuff\" - \nfrom the government. \nAlmost half of the population has no skin in the game - they \ndon't care about high taxes, promoting business, or creating \njobs, nor do they care that the money for their free stuff is \nbeing borrowed from their children and from the Chinese. \nThey just want the free stuff that comes their way at someone \nelse's expense. In the end, that 47% leaves very little margin \nfor error for any Republican, and does not bode well for the \nfuture. \nIt is impossible to imagine a conservative candidate winning against such overwhelming \nodds. People do vote their pocketbooks. In essence, the people vote for a Congress who will \nnot raise their taxes, and for a President who will give them free stuff, never mind who has to \npay for it. \nThat engenders the second reason why Romney lost: the inescapable conclusion that the \nelectorate is ignorant and uninformed. Indeed, it does not pay to be an informed voter, \nbecause most other voters - the clear majority — are unintelligent and easily swayed by \nemotion and raw populism. That is the indelicate way of saying that too many people vote \nwith their hearts and not their heads. That is why Obama did not have to produce a second \nterm agenda, or even defend his first-term record. He needed only to portray Mitt Romney as \na rapacious capitalist who throws elderly women over a cliff, when he is not just snatching \naway their cancer medication, while starving the poor and cutting taxes for the rich. \nDuring his 1956 presidential campaign, a woman called out to Adlai Stevenson: \"Senator, you \nhave the vote of every thinking person!\" Stevenson called back: \"That's not enough, madam, \nwe need a majority!\" \nTruer words were never spoken. \nObama could get away with saying that \"Romney wants the rich to play by a different set of \nrules\" - without ever defining what those different rules were; with saying that the \"rich \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 031701 \nshould pay their fair share\" - without ever defining what a \"fair share\" is; with saying that \nRomney wants the poor, elderly and sick to \"fend for themselves\" - without even \nacknowledging that all these government programs are going bankrupt, their current \ninsolvency only papered over by deficit spending. \nSimilarly, Obama (or his surrogates) could hint to blacks that a Romney victory would lead \nthem back into chains and proclaim to women that their abortions and birth control would be \ntaken away. He could appeal to Hispanics that Romney would have them all arrested and \nshipped to Mexico and unabashedly state that he will not enforce the current immigration \nlaws. He could espouse the furtherance of the incestuous relationship between governments \nand unions - in which politicians ply the unions with public money, in exchange for which the \nunions provide the politicians with votes, in exchange for which the politicians provide more \nmoney and the unions provide more votes, etc., even though the money is gone. \nObama also knows that the electorate has changed - \nAmerica (they're already a minority in California) and that the new immigrants to the US are \nprimarily from the Third World and do not share the traditional American values that attracted \nimmigrants in the 19th and 20th centuries. It is a different world, and a different America. \nObama is part of that different America, knows it, and knows how to tap into it. That is why \nhe won. \nthat whites will soon be a minority in \nObama also proved again that negative advertising works, invective sells, and harsh personal \nattacks succeed. That Romney never engaged in such diatribes points to his essential \ngoodness as a person; his \"negative ads\" were simple facts, never personal abuse - facts \nabout high unemployment, lower take-home pay, a loss of American power and prestige \nabroad, a lack of leadership, etc. As a politician, though, Romney failed because he did not \nembrace the devil's bargain of making unsustainable promises. \nIt turned out that it was not possible for Romney and Ryan - people of substance, depth and \nideas - to compete with the shallow populism and platitudes of their opponents. Obama \nmastered the politics of envy — of class warfare - never reaching out to Americans as such \nbut to individual groups, and cobbling together a winning majority from these minority \ngroups. If an Obama could not be defeated - with his record and his vision of America, in \nwhich free stuff seduces voters - it is hard to envision any change in the future. \nThe road to Hillary Clinton in 2016 and to a European-socialist \neconomy - those very economies that are collapsing today in \nEurope - is paved. \nFor Jews, mostly assimilated anyway and staunch Democrats, the results demonstrate again \nthat liberalism is their Torah. Almost 70% voted for a \npresident widely perceived by Israelis and most committed Jews as hostile to Israel . They \nvoted to secure Obama's future at America 's expense and at Israel 's expense - in effect, \npreferring Obama to Netanyahu by a wide margin. \nA dangerous time is ahead. Under present circumstances, it is \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 031702 \ninconceivable that the US will take any aggressive action \nagainst Iran and will more likely thwart any Israeli initiative. \nThe US will preach the importance of negotiations up until the \nproduction of the first Iranian nuclear weapon - and then state \nthat the world must learn to live with this new reality. \nBut this election should be a wake-up call to Jews. There is no permanent empire, nor is there \nan enduring haven for Jews anywhere in the exile. The American empire began to decline in \n2007, and the deterioration has been exacerbated in the last five years. This election only \nhastens that decline. \nSociety is permeated with sloth, greed, envy and materialistic excess. It has lost its moorings \nand its moral foundations.. The takers outnumber the givers, and that will only increase in \nyears to come. \nThe \"Occupy\" riots across this country in the last two years \nwere mere dress rehearsals for what lies ahead - years of \nunrest sparked by the increasing discontent of the \nunsuccessful who want to seize the fruits and the bounty of \nthe successful, and do not appreciate the slow pace of \nredistribution. \nIf this election proves one thing, it is that the Old America is gone And, sad for the world, it is \nnot coming back.\" \nThe problems we face today are there because the people who \nwork for a living are outnumbered by those who vote for a  \nliving.  \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 031703 \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 031704 \n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

There had been some\nopposition to the war: from parts of Labor, from political groups further to the\nleft and particularly the pressure group Peace Now, formed in 1978 to protest\nthe Begin government’s obvious desire to use the peace with Egypt as a means\nto limit, rather than actively explore, prospects for a wider agreement with the\nPalestinians.\n\nAfter Sabra and Shatila, Peace Now was the driving force behind demands\nfor an inquiry into the Israeli role into what had happened. But the trauma went\ndeeper. Israelis of all political stripes jammed shoulder-to-shoulder into the\nKings of Israeli Square in the heart of Tel Aviv a week after the massacre.\nThere were soldiers, too: 20somethings back from the fighting and reservists a\ndecade or more older. Some estimates put the size of the crowd at as many as\n400,000, almost ten percent of the population of Israel at the time. The protest\nwas nominally aimed at forcing the government to empower a commission of\ninquiry, which it did a couple of days later. But the mood in the square was\nmore like an outpouring of shock and shame. While the catalyst was the\nmassacre in the camps, it tapped into a rumble of growing questions, and\ndoubts, about the war itself, which had been building ever since the prolonged\nsiege of west Beirut: what the invasion was for, how it had been planned and\nprosecuted, and what it said about our country, our government and our armed\nforces.\n\nI was at home with Nava, watching the coverage of the demonstration on\ntelevision. I shared the protesters’ view that an inquiry was needed. In the days\nsince my phone call to Tsila Drori, ’'d remained troubled not just by our failure\nto stop the killings once we knew what was going on, but by the response from\nBegin, Arik and some other ministers to the massacre. Determined to shift the\nblame and responsibility elsewhere, they kept driving home the point that it was\nPhalangists, not Israelis, who had carried out the killings. That was true. But it\ncould not erase the failures of judgment and control on our part. We were the\nones who had allowed them into the camps. Our forces were deployed around\nthe perimeter. And the killers were our “Lebanese Christian allies”.\n\nThe formal picking-apart of Israel’s share of responsibility would be the job\nof the inquiry commission. I did take some heart from the very fact such large\n\n207\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_011678\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

In contrast to common (mis)understanding, the letter did not embody or reflect law. It was not law\nin any sense of the word. It was not reporting on an act of Congress, nor was it setting forth an\nadministrative regulation enjoying the force of law. It was a letter — providing guidance, not the\ndirection that law enjoys. Nor did that guidance call for the appointment of a full-time Title IX\ncoordinator. To the contrary, that administrative step was more than three years away.\n\nThree days after OCR’s “Dear Colleague” letter appeared, a public panel discussion took place on the\nBaylor campus. In addition to myself, Vice President Jackson and Student Body President Wright\ndiscussed a wide range of student-safety issues, and took questions from the floor. This on-campus\nconversation was illustrative of what was underway around the nation. Everyone was aware of myriad\nconcerns about student safety, including freedom from interpersonal violence. No one had his or her\nhead in the sand, nor averted his or her gaze to avoid facing unpleasantness — or worse.\n\nThe work of the Campus Task Force was completed, and in the fall of 2012, a Campus Safety Committee\nwas formed. The Safety Committee pulled together stakeholders from all across campus to discuss any\nand all threats to student safety. Issues relating to sexual assault were an integral part of the broad\nmandate the Committee examined.\n\nFor its first three years, the Campus Safety Committee was chaired by Vice President Jackson. Its work\nenjoyed the unalloyed support of the entire Executive Council. Then, in the following June (2013), |\npersonally issued a memorandum creating a specialized Task Force Review of Sexual Violence to conduct\na comprehensive review of Baylor’s policies and practices relating to sexual violence. This Task Force\n(operating at the same time as the Campus Safety Committee) was formed in response to the\nrecommendations and concerns expressed by John Whelan, then the head of Human Resources.\n\nAction items quickly emerged. The entering freshman class that fall (August 2013) were specifically\nbriefed by a senior Student Life staff member on what was expected in terms of proper, upright\nbehavior. Entering students were provided with a copy of OCR’s “Know Your Rights” summary, along\nwith a highly-specific cover letter from Vice President Jackson. The following month (September 2013)\nthe “Do Something!” campaign was launched — a sexual assault prevention campaign hosted the week\nafter Labor Day 2013. The campaign was sponsored by Baylor’s Sexual Assault Advisory Board, chaired\nby Dr. Cheryl Wooten, an outstanding leader recognized across the nation for her expertise in dealing\nwith the horror and trauma of sexual violence.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_031537\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

Mr. Gerry said he could review the case further to see if it could be brought back for additional fines. Mr. Hoffman asked if these cases were brought to Code Enforcement by the Finance Department and Mr. Gerry said they came from the Fire Prevention Bureau who handles their own billing and explained the procedure for that.  Mr. Hoffman said it seemed like a year was a long time for these cases to be in arrears.  Mr. Gerry said the cases were coming over quicker now from Fire Prevention and he thought it would improve in the future.\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\tMOTION BY MR.

The Zoning Administrator is out of the office this week on jury duty and based on the inability to get the issue resolved, the Town recommends the case be postponed until the August 21, 2008 hearing date.\n\n          \n\n          Mr. Fried questioned what the zoning issue had to do with a business tax receipt and Mr. Gerry said the Town records do not show this particular suite existing at this address but Mr. Clark has documents showing it there.\n\n\t\t\n\n          \n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n          Mr. Gerry said zoning is tied into business tax receipts because zoning requirements do not allow certain businesses in some districts.  There is also the question of whether the space is legitimate because people will subdivide suites and make two spaces where there should only be one.  Mr. Gerry said it looked like a legal space from the documentation Mr. Clark provided but the Zoning Administrator needed to approve it.  \n\n\n\n\t\tMOTION BY MR.

Ibis Isle Road, Mark Remson Trust\n\n\t\tREPEAT Violation of Chapter 42, Section 42-86 of the Town of Palm Beach Code of Ordinances, Environment, properties to be maintained in a good condition.\n\n\n\n\t\tCode Enforcement Officer Weymer presented the facts of the case and said the violation was discovered from routine patrol in the area but shortly after the notice of repeat violation was sent out, a citizen complaint was received as well.  Mr. Weymer said there had been at least seven previous letters to this property owner regarding lack of maintenance on the property. A repeat notice of code violation was mailed out on June 24, 2008 with a mandatory hearing date.  The lot was cut on or around July 2, 2008.  This particular violation is a Class II violation under the fine schedule which calls for a fine of $400.00, however, by law, the Board has the ability to impose a fine of up to $500.00 because it is a repeat violation.  Mr. Weymer said he believes it is important to look at the track record of this property in considering the fine.  The Town recommends a finding of non-compliance, administrative costs in the amount of $150.00 and a fine of $500.00, which is the maximum fine for a repeat violation.\n\n\n\n\t\tMr. Hoffman said it seemed that every time the property owner gets notified he comes into compliance but he has to be notified.  Mr. Weymer says there are times when he comes into compliance but on at least two other occasions, he has been before the Board because he has not complied by the time set.  Mr. Ochstein asked if he has been fined in the past and Mr. Weymer said there are two outstanding fines for which liens have been placed on the property.  \n\n\n\n\t\tMOTION BY MS.

Mr. Weymer has been in contact with a property representative, Louis Pascerelli who said Mr. Horton had not been in Town to receive his mail. Mr. Weymer said Mr. Pascerelli had proposals from Hansen Landscape for the clean up and re-sod of the lot and a weekly maintenance contract to assure this does not happen again.  Tropical Irrigation has also been contacted to put in a new irrigation system.  The Town recommends a finding of non-compliance, administrative costs in the amount of $150.00 and the property owner be given until August 18, 2008 to come into compliance. Mr. Fried said he believed a fine of some sort should be imposed.  Mr. Ballentine asked how long Mr. Horton had been out of compliance.  Mr. Weymer said the original warning was sent on June 5, 2008 and a notice of violation and hearing was sent on June 20, 2008.  Mr. Weymer said the first contact with the property owner was July 7, 2008.  Mr. Ballentine asked if the August compliance date was reasonable and Mr. Weymer said Jim Hansen of Hansen Landscape thought the work would be done before that date but wanted more time in case he ran into any problems. \n\n\n\n\n\n          MOTION BY MR.

AMF had previously been warned on February 19, 2008 for using a leaf blower over 65dBA.  Mr. Weymer performed a decibel test for this violation and the reading was 79.6 dBA at 50 feet. This is a class II violation under the fine schedule which has a $125.00 fine for the first offense.  The violation was issued on site to a superintendant for AMF and has not been paid.  The Town recommends a finding of non-compliance, administrative costs in the amount of $150.00 and payment of the $125.00 fine.\n\n          \n\n          Mr. Hoffman asked whether this company had participated in the leaf blower testing being offered by Code Enforcement.  Mr. Weymer said AMF had participated in the testing program and had several leaf blowers certified.  He said the truck he was out with had 2 other leaf blowers on the truck that he could identify as being over 65dBA but he only tested the one they were using and wrote a violation for that one.  Ms. Van Buren asked about the testing method and Mr. Weymer explained how it was done.  \n\n\n\n          \tMOTION BY MR.

Curtis Krauel said this case was brought to Code Enforcement through a culmination of events spanning back over a period of 4 years.  Sgt. Krauel explained Section 10-6 of the Code and said he was going to be showing some graphic photographs.  Sgt. Krauel presented the facts of each of the documented cases involving attacks by Duke from March 17, 2004 until May 11, 2008.\n\n          \n\n          Mr. Hoffman questioned how the Code Enforcement Board came into this procedure since the Town Council had already said Duke is a dangerous dog. Mr. Randolph explained that Town Council does not have the authority to fine.  Originally, the police department did not issue a code enforcement board citation but ordered the dog be removed from the Town or humanely euthanized which was appealed to Town Council.  Town Council denied the appeal. Since that time, Dr. Lynn has refused to comply with the order of the Town Council so a citation was issued by Code Enforcement to bring the matter before the Board to determine whether there should be a finding of violation and at a later time, whether a fine should be imposed. Mr. Randolph said it was now the jurisdiction of the Code Enforcement Board and not the Town Council.  Mr. Hoffman questioned whether or not the Board had to determine if the dog was going to be euthanized or removed from the Town and Mr. Randolph explained that this was not the Board’s determination.  The Board was only to determine whether or not there had been a violation of the Town Code.  \n\n\n\n\t\tSgt. Krauel continued his presentation remarking that once Duke had been found “potentially dangerous” by Animal Care and Control, there had been another attack but due to an administrative error by Animal Care and Control in failing to document their records appropriately, Duke was classified as “potentially dangerous” again.  This is an error that Animal Care and Control completely acknowledges. \n\n\n\n\t\tAfter the last attack on May 11, 2008, Duke was taken into custody by Animal Care and Control and after a hearing, was classified as “dangerous”.  Sgt. Krauel noted that the hearing before Special Magistrate Earl Mallory did not classify Duke as vicious because Duke had no documented cases of attacks on humans.  After this last case was reviewed by Code Enforcement, sufficient evidence was also found by the Town to classify Duke as dangerous and Dr. Lynn was notified by registered mail.  Dr. Lynn appealed to Town Council and that appeal was denied by Town Council by a 5-0 vote.  The Town recommends a finding of non-compliance with Chapter 10, Section 10-6 as the Town has the two required affidavits of residents of the Town occupying separate households.  The Board was provided with copies of four (4) affidavits.  \n\n\n\n\t\tSgt. Krauel then proceeded with an explanation of Chapter 10, Section 10-45 and said the Town was requesting a separate motion for a finding of non-compliance of Chapter 10, Section 10-45 (i) and that Dr. Lynn be given until July 18, 2008 to come into compliance by either removing the dog from the Town or having it humanely euthanized.  If compliance is not achieved, the Town recommends a daily fine of $250.00 a day commence on July 19, 2008 and continue until compliance is achieved.  \n\n\n\n\t\tMr. Randolph requested the Board treat these two sections of the Code separate and apart.  He said the first evidence heard related to Section 10-6 (3) and involved the affidavits from the residents of the Town.  Because of the dispute Dr. Lynn’s attorney has with regard to the manner that Section 10-45 was applied, Mr. Randolph recommended the two Code sections not be mixed up.  Mr. Randolph said he would like for the Board to first consider whether there had been a violation of 10-6 and to make a motion one way or the other with regard to the Staff’s recommendation.  He then requested that Section 10-45 be entertained separately after Dr. Lynn’s attorney and anyone else who wanted to speak had an opportunity to do so.  \n\n\n\n\t\tVivian Dorris, 155 Brazilian Ave., said her beagle/bassett, Charlie, was viciously attacked by Dr. Lynn’s dog, Duke and she has sustained approximately $8500 in vet’s bills.  She said her dog will never walk properly again because of severe nerve damage.  She does not feel there are enough precautions being taken for the safety of residents on Brazilian Ave.  She asked that the Board take this into consideration and thanked them for their service.\n\n\n\n\t\tWayne Gerl, 149 Brazilian Ave., said he has two dogs and every time he exits his driveway or front yard, he has to stop and peek around and make sure the other dogs are not in the area.  He said he was bitten by Duke a couple of years ago.  He was talking with Dr. Lynn and the dog just reached out and bit him, tearing his pants and breaking the skin.  He said he has been friends with Dr. Lynn and Margrit for many years but it was just unsafe for anybody and any animals in the area. \n\n\n\n\t\tBobby Goodnough said he was jogging in the area and the dog lunged at him, causing him to have to dive through a 12 foot hedge to get away from it.   He said he just thought it was a matter of time before the dog got a person or a child. Sgt. Krauel asked if Mr. Goodnough had reported the incident to the police department or had a time frame of occurrence.  Mr. Goodnough said he had not made a police report but it occurred about 2 years ago. \n\n\n\n\t\tLaura Klein, 130 Seaspray Ave., said she had lived here for 12 years, having moved from Washington, D.C. for a sense of security.  She said she was now in the process of installing surveillance cameras.  She said she could no longer walk her dog without constantly looking around, worrying if Duke had once again escaped from the open gates.  She said it is a privilege to own a dog and dog ownership and responsibility should go hand in hand.  She said Dr. Lynn was issued a citation in August of 2002 for locking his dog in a car with the windows rolled up. She said she mentioned this to prove his irresponsibility.  She said his voluminous file from Animal Care and Control would attest to this.   She said no one was safe while Duke is in Palm Beach.  \n\n\n\n\t\tJames Merola was present on behalf of Dr. Lynn and said he was present on a revised Notice of Code Violation and Hearing dated July 15, 2008.  He said he was not denying there were incidents with Duke.  Palm Beach County had the dog taken into custody and the hearing was held June 5, 2008.  At that hearing, it was agreed upon by the County and Dr. Lynn that the dog would be classified as dangerous.  The dog was classified as dangerous which required certain restrictions on the dog which Dr. Lynn complied with and the dog was returned to him.  In the event Duke has another incident, pursuant to state and county law, but some reason not Town law, the dog would be taken into custody and euthanized.  Mr. Merola said Dr. Lynn feels very badly about the situation and agreed with the County to do what they required.   Mr. Merola said Dr. Lynn then received a letter, dated June 16, 2008 from the police department, mentioning the order of the County and stating for the first time that the Town was declaring the dog dangerous and giving him ten (10) days to appeal, which he did not. On June 20, 2008, 4 days after the dog was declared dangerous by the Town, the police department sent a second letter, citing 10-45 (i), advising that since the dog already had two incidents, they wanted it removed or euthanized.  The dog had not done anything since being declared dangerous.  This letter did not mention an appeal, but he sent a letter anyway, stating they did not agree with that.  He said the dog was declared dangerous on June 16th, requirements were imposed and they complied with those, including the filing of a $1000 bond and they did not agree the dog should now be removed.  There was a Town Council hearing on August 8th and the Council said they needed to have the dog removed or euthanized.  Mr. Merola went into detail about the requirements of 10-45 and said Dr. Lynn had complied with all of those.  Then the letter of June 20th came, requiring Dr. Lynn to remove the dog or euthanize it.  Mr. Merola read subsection (h) into the record and said the Code Enforcement Board did not have any jurisdiction over subsection (i) as subsection (h) just mentioned (d) through (g).  The Town filed a lawsuit and he and Mr. Randolph were before Judge Hoy this morning.  The Town is asking to have the dog removed or euthanized and asking for a permanent injunction, stating an emergency situation.  Judge Hoy gave them a hearing at 1:30 p.m. on Tuesday where it will be determined whether the dog is a nuisance, whether 10-45 (i) even applies to the situation and if the Board has authority over 10-45 (i).  If the Judge says the dog has to go, they are not going to argue with the Court but he believes they have a right to present their case.  He does not believe the Town’s position that the fine should start tomorrow is correct.  He believes the Board can only find violations of subsections (d) through (g) of 10-45.  There have been no allegations that Dr. Lynn has violated subsections (d) through (g).  Mr. Merola believes it is clear that the Code Enforcement Board has no authority under (i). Mr. Merola then addressed 10-6 and said he believed that since all precautions have been taken under 10-45, the dog does not constitute a nuisance.  Mr. Merola said he has an injunction relief request before the Judge to stop the Board from making this decision.  Mr. Merola said Mr. Randolph has asked them to determine these two (2) ordinances separately and he does not believe 10-45 (i) is in the Board’s purview, and as to the nuisance, the dog has to be a nuisance now and it is not.  This is all going to be determined Tuesday and he is asking the Board to either deny the Town’s recommendation because the Town cannot prove the dog is a nuisance now or reset this case until next month’s hearing.  \n\n\n\n\t\tSgt. Krauel advised he wanted to make a rebuttal to some of Mr. Merola’s comments. The service of notice Mr. Merola referred to in declaring the dog dangerous was when the police department spoke with Dr. Lynn on June 12, 2008 and was told Duke was being housed at a kennel in Palm Beach County.  A notice could not be served to Dr. Lynn to have him come into compliance with something he was already in compliance with.  The dog was not in the Town.  The police department did not find out the dog was in Town until June 20th when Laura Klein reported the dog attempted to break free of Dr. Lynn to attack her and this is when the letter was sent out requesting compliance with Section 10-45.  Dr. Lynn was given the entire ordinance on June 10th, not just sections or specific acts that he needed to comply with.  Duke was not on the property at that time and no notification to remove the dog from the property could be served then because the dog was not there.  As far as the police department was concerned, Dr. Lynn was in compliance with the ordinance.  Sgt. Krauel pointed out that the Town does not abide by the state and the county ordinances, that the Town has the ability to enforce more stringent and strict ordinances and that is what we have done here.  \n\n\n\n\t\tSgt. Krauel said he was prepared, based on Counsel’s recommendation, to recommend a motion to find Dr. Lynn in non-compliance with Section 10-6 and move to postpone 10-45 (i) until after further consideration by the Circuit Court on Tuesday.  The Town recommends administrative costs in the amount of $150.00 and a fine of $250.00 a day to start on June 19, 2008 if compliance is not achieved by June 18, 2008.  \n\n\n\n\t\tMr. Ballentine asked for clarification on the motion and was advised by Mr. Randolph that it would be a finding of non-compliance of Chapter 10, Section 10-6, administrative costs of $150.00 and a compliance date of July 18, 2008 with a fine to be considered at the next meeting if compliance was not achieved.\n\n\n\n\t\tMs. Duemler said she believed that the dog, besides being a nuisance, is a threat to society and she hoped that by Tuesday the dog did not break loose from Dr. Lynn and maul some child, that she believed it is a disgrace and she supports the Town.\n\n\n\n\t\t(applause from the audience)\n\n\n\n\t\tMOTION BY MR. FRIED TO FIND DR. LYNN IN VIOLATION OF CHAPTER 10, SECTION 10-6,  ASSESS ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS IN THE AMOUNT OF $150.00 AND REQUIRE HIM TO COME INTO COMPLIANCE BY JULY 18, 2008\n\n\t\tMOTION SECONDED BY MR. BALLENTINE\n\n\t\tMOTION PASSED UNANIMOUSLY\n\n\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\tMr. Randolph asked if a motion could be made to defer the consideration of violation of Chapter 10, Section 10-45 (i) until the August 21, 2008 meeting and Ms. Greenberg advised she would make that motion.  Mr. Fried asked Mr. Randolph if he would explain the reason for this.  Mr. Randolph said the argument had been made that 10-45 should not apply because the dog has already been deemed dangerous by the County and pursuant to the Town’s Code.  Mr. Randolph said he believed the argument was going to be made in court on Tuesday that it is not appropriate for the Town to move forward with regard to 10-45 (i) because that only applies to any incident that occurs after the dog has been declared dangerous.  The argument has been made that Dr. Lynn has done everything he is required to do.  Mr. Randolph said he hesitated to explain further if the matter was going to be deferred.  Mr. Randolph said the position of Staff is that item (i) stands on its own merits, that it is not connected to 10-45 (a) through (h).  It is also the position of Staff that it is appropriate to bring a violation of (i) to the Code Enforcement Board even though it does not specifically state that in 10-45 because Section 2-439, which is the citation fine schedule, sets forth all of the sections of the Code of Ordinances which can be brought before the Code Enforcement Board and 10-45 is listed.  Code Enforcement has the right to bring a violation directly to the Code Enforcement Board instead of issuing the fine set forth in the fine schedule. Mr. Randolph said the Board could move forward in considering 10-45 instead of deferring it to the next meeting. \n\n\n\n\t\tMr. Fried commented that based on the egregious nature of what they had been presented with, he believed the Board should do everything they could to put pressure on Dr. Lynn to comply.  Mr. Randolph questioned whether the Town would be requesting a separate fine of $250.00 a day for non-compliance and Sgt. Krauel said that was his recommendation, that there would be two concurrent fines running.  Mr. Hoffman asked about the administrative costs and Sgt. Krauel said the Town was only asking for one.\n\n\n\n\t\tMOTION BY MR. FRIED TO FIND DR. LYNN IN VIOLATION OF CHAPTER 10, SECTION 10-45 (i) AND REQUIRE HIM TO COME INTO COMPLIANCE BY JULY 18, 2008\n\n\t\tSECONDED BY MS. GREENBERG\n\n\t\tMOTION PASSED UNANIMOUSLY\n\n\n\n\t\tMr. Merola questioned what the order was with regard to 10-6, if it was to have the dog removed or euthanized by Friday or just to abate the nuisance.  He said he needed to know what to tell Dr. Lynn what had to be done by Friday to avoid the potential fine.  Mr. Hoffman said Dr. Lynn needed to either remove the dog or have it euthanized and Mr. Fried said that was his intention in making the motion. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVI.\tOld Business:\n\n\n\n\tA.\tCase # 08-2484, 515 N.

Mr. Trump’s attorney and the attorney for the new purchaser were both present.  \n\n\n\n\t\tRobert Brody said he was the attorney for County Road Property LLC, who had just purchased the property two days ago.  He said it was the intent of his client to comply with the Town and also to work with the Town.  There is an appeal pending and Mr. Brody said it was his client’s intent to work everything out with ARCOM prior to that appeal. He said he had recommended to his client that he withdraw the appeal. Mr. Brody said his client had hired the Lawrence Group and Gene Lawrence planned to work with ARCOM.  \n\n\n\n\t\t\n\n          MOTION BY MS.

A permit was obtained but there were some conditions attached to it.  There have been two inspections with the Florida Wildlife Commission and an agreement was reached to not require the vegetation to be trimmed until after turtle season.  Since they have already been found in non-compliance, the Town recommends the time for compliance be extended to November 7, 2008 and if compliance is not achieved by that date, a fine of $250.00 a day be imposed.  \n\n          \n\n          Jack Maxey, 244 Nightingale Trail, presented some documents to the Board and advised he was president of the Nightingale Trail Beach Club Association.  He said one of the documents was his application under duress for the permit.  Mr. Maxey advised he had not been sworn in and was administered the oath of office by Recording Secretary Houston.  \n\n          \n\n          Mr. Maxey said he has had a long correspondence with the legal department of the Department of Environmental Protection and he believes on an emotional level, they do not believe the trees should come down but they told him they could not find any statutory way to force the Town not to enforce the permit.  They told him it should be the jurisdiction of a court, not the DEP. Mr. Maxey said the Town was cutting down its own sea grapes in violation of the permitting process. Mr. Maxey said there were all kinds of burdens in this permit he needed to comply with, one of which was replacement of the whole plant if anything over 6 feet tall which was larger than 3 inches in diameter was cut down.  He said he was supposed to provide a signature on the document putting himself at risk of a $10,000 a day fine if he did not comply with the requirements of the permit. Mr. Maxey said Jean Higgins, a biologist for the State Fish & Wildlife, recommended sea grapes should not be trimmed because they are the best source of protection against the lighting.  Ms. Higgins made some suggestions such as changing light fixtures and extinguishing lights during turtle season and maintaining a substantial healthy vegetation light blocking buffer.  \n\n          \n\n          Mr. Maxey said an approximate 24 inch piece of aluminum is hanging from the light on Nightingale Trail and it seemed highly unusual that a shield of that nature would only be necessary on that light when the recommendations given by Fish & Wildlife are recommendations with broad reaching impact for the entire island.  He noted that the street lights in Palm Beach do not go off during turtle nesting season.  He said a field permit for trimming of the sea grapes at the Nightingale Beach Club Association was not recommended during the nesting season.  He said the indifference to materials he had brought forth more than a year ago that had now been brought forth officially by the DEP were offensive to him and that is one of the reasons he had continued to “hammer” this.   He said he believed the Board should recommend to the Town Council that they remove this section of the Code, given the current environmental regime, especially when one considers the public relations downside of fighting him on this issue and spending $2,000,000 to fight Lake Worth on the other side.  Mr. Maxey said this was probably not a win-win situation and that NOAA had not even been brought into the fold yet.  \n\n          \n\n          Mr. Ochstein wanted to know if the Board was precluded from enforcing the ordinance now.  Mr. Walton said it should not be enforced now, that in speaking with Mr. Wettstein from DEP and Ms. Higgins from FWC, an agreement had been reached to wait until the end of turtle season to require the trimming.  The Town recommends granting the Nightingale Beach Club until November 7, 2008 to come into compliance.  The permit is good until that date. In response to Mr. Hoffman’s question, Mr. Walton said the permit was issued on June 16, 2008.  Mr. Maxey said he applied on March 19, 2008.  Mr. Balletine inquired as to whether 7 days was sufficient for compliance after the end of turtle season and Mr. Walton said it was not a large area and he believed it was. Mr. Maxey said he did not believe it was sufficient, that it would be an economic hardship if he had to replace every tree that is over 3 inches in diameter in order to get it below 6 feet and he brought up other issues involved with the trimming.  Mr. Balletine told Mr. Maxey he just wanted to know, without going into a lot of detail, whether he could comply in a 7 day period..  Mr. Maxey said that before he could remove any native plant, he had to first remove every single non-native one from the property and he had some questions whether or not he could comply within that time period.  He also said he had some real questions about whether the law, both at the State and the local level, had been equally applied within the Town. Mr. Maxey said he is in consultation with an attorney to find out what measures he can take.  The Town did not apply for a permit to cut its own sea grapes and judging from the guidelines he has in his permit, the Town would be in violation of almost everyone of those guidelines.  The DEP counsel’s office asked him to provide photographs of the Town’s illegal cutting back in February.  \n\n          \n\n          Mr. Vanneck said there should be more research as to what should and should not be cut.  He believes the Town code may have gone too far.  \n\n          \n\n          Mr. Hoffman said the Board did not have the authority to modify the Code and could only enforce the Codes as they had been written.\n\n          \n\n          MOTION BY MR. OCHSTEIN TO GRANT THE VIOLATOR UNTIL NOVEMBER 7, 2008 TO COME INTO COMPLIANCE AND IF COMPLIANCE IS NOT ACHIEVED BY THAT DATE, TO ASSESS A FINE IN THE AMOUNT OF $250.00 A DAY UNTIL COMPLIANCE IS ACHIEVED\n\n          SECONDED BY MR. BALLENTINE\n\n          \n\n          Mr. Vanneck asked for clarification on what the motion was and Mr. Walton advised the motion was that the sea grapes must be cut after turtle season, by November 7, 2008 and if they were not cut by that date, a $250.00 a day fine would commence on November 8, 2008 and continue until compliance was achieved.\n\n          \n\n          Mr. Fried asked who the fine would apply to and Mr. Walton said it would be to the Nightingale Trail Beach Club Association.  Mr. Fried asked if this was a legally constituted body and Mr. Maxey said it was an informal body, that on the deeds, everyone owns this piece of property in common.  There was some additional discussion on the ordinance.  Ms. Van Buren asked if every single property owner on the street was a member of the association and Mr. Maxey said every property owner on Nightingale Trail was and there were one or two houses on North Ocean and North Lake as well.  Mr. Maxey said there were 23 separate memberships.  Ms. Van Buren asked about the finances and Mr. Maxey said there were annual dues of $75.00 a year and a common bank account of $3500 or $3600.  Mr. Maxey said that if a fine was incurred, that is probably where the money would come from but he did not believe, because of his fiduciary responsibility to the group, he could fight the decision with any of those monies.  Mr. Ochstein asked if he was an elected officer and Mr. Maxey said he was president and that he keeps the books and makes sure the place is in good condition.\n\n          \n\n          MOTION BY MR.

Mr. Fried said it was not beyond the Town Council’s power and authority, if persuaded, to look into an ordinance and suggested Mr. Maxey address it with them.  \n\n          \n\n          \n\n\tB.\tCase # 08-2508, 227 Brazilian Ave., 2F, Hillen J. Smith\n\n          Violation of Chapter 18, Section 18-241 of the Town of Palm Beach Code of Ordinances, building permits required to construct, install, repair or alter any building or building system\n\n          \n\n          Lead Code Enforcement Officer said Mr. Smith was found in violation, assessed $150.00 in administrative costs and given until July 16, 2008 to come into compliance.  Compliance has not been achieved so this is the time a fine would be assessed.  Mr. Walton said the contractor was present to speak.  \n\n          \n\n          Steve Pappanelli said he was hired by Mr. Smith after Mr. Smith had been cited and he was 90% complete with the job.  He was just waiting on his final inspection and he should have it by next week but the building is closed to all construction inspections for two (2) weeks. Mr. Pappanelli said he was present on Mr. Smith’s behalf to request a three (3) week extension.   Mr. Walton said the Town did not oppose the extension of time.  Mr. Walton said the three weeks was necessary because the building would not let inspections be done while their maintenance man was on vacation.  Mr. Walton said if compliance was not achieved by August 7, 2008 then he would ask for a $250.00 a day fine to commence on August 8, 2008.  \n\n          \n\n          Ms. Greenberg asked some questions about the type of permits and remarked that it is unfortunate in multi-family dwellings that this type of situation would exist to begin with because electrical and plumbing can have catastrophic effects on other owners.  She said it is unfortunate the people do not do the right thing until they get caught.  Mr. Pappanelli said he was not the contractor working without permits.  \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          MOTION BY MR. OCHSTEIN TO GRANT AN EXTENSION OF TIME UNTIL AUGUST 8, 2008 TO COME INTO COMPLIANCE AND TO ASSESS A FINE OF $250.00, RETROACTIVE TO JULY 17, 2008 IF COMPLIANCE WAS NOT ACHIEVED\n\n\t\tSECONDED BY MS. GREENBERG\n\n\n\n\t\tDuring discussion on the motion, Ms. Duemler stated she believed the retroactive \n\n          fine was a little harsh.  Mr. Ballentine said he agreed and asked the reason for the retroactive fine.  Mr. Ochstein said there are so many people who do work without a permit and they know they need a permit.  That is a very dangerous thing in a multi-family dwelling and it should be egregious.  \n\n\n\n          MOTION BY MR. OCHSTEIN TO GRANT AN EXTENSION OF TIME UNTIL AUGUST 8, 2008 TO COME INTO COMPLIANCE AND TO ASSESS A FINE OF $250.00, RETROACTIVE TO JULY 17, 2008 IF COMPLIANCE WAS NOT ACHIEVED\n\n\t\tSECONDED BY MS.

Inlet Drive, The Landfall Group, \n\n          Violation of Chapter 18, Section 18-242, Subsection 104.5.1.6, medium projects, all new or remodel construction projects 4000 sq. ft, to 8,999 sq. ft. under roof be allowed 22 months\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          Lead Code Enforcement Officer Walton said in October, 2007, Ajax Equity LLC was found in violation of going over the construction time limits.  On November 15, 2008 they still were not in compliance and a daily fine of $250.00 started running. The final inspection was obtained in March, 2008.  The fine ran for 137 days prior to compliance being achieved and the accumulated fine due is $34,250.00 and the $150.00 hearing costs have not been paid.  \n\n          \n\n          Frank Lynch advised he was the attorney for both The Landfall Group and\tAjax.  He said when they appeared before the Board in October, Lazslo Wagner, the principal of The Landfall Group, who has built homes throughout the Town of Palm Beach for 26 years acknowledged he was unaware of this particular code provision.  Had he been, they would have applied for an extension of time to complete the construction.  At the hearing, Mr. Koeppel made a motion to allow them an additional sixty (60) days to complete the construction, find them in non-compliance and assess the $150 costs.  After a significant amount of discussion, that motion went to a vote and failed 4-3.  A second motion was made and Ms. Duemler thought the $250.00 fee was significant and believed the fine should be $125.00 a day.  Mr. Lynch gave Mr. Walton a copy of that transcript to put in the record.  As part of their request, they are asking the Board to consider what Ms. Duemler suggested at the meeting. At the same time, Mr. Lynch said he would like them to consider that The Landfall Group is a good corporate citizen and made a legitimate mistake.  As a result, a fine was incurred and they are willing to accept some level of fine, some level of responsibility for what they did.  The construction was continually on going, there were no delays other than the construction process itself.  This was not someone’s house, it was a speculative venture.  There had been some concerns with the shell contractor and the finish items themselves were significant enough that there were substantial delays.  At that same hearing, Code Enforcement Officer Gerry said it was the position of Code Enforcement to get more assertive at the suggestion of Town Council and that these projects were to be more aggressively pursued.  Under the new ordinance, for a house of approximately 5,000 sq. feet, they would be entitled to 24 months.  This would have brought them to November 2007 and they would have gotten additional time for Hurricane Wilma which would have brought them to December.  If they were under the new Code, they would not be before the Board today and may not have a fine at all.  He realizes a mistake was made, he realizes something has to be paid but he thinks $35,000 is a significant fine.  The Board has gotten their attention and they would ask for a significant reduction in the fine.\n\n          \n\n          Mr. Fried asked how long it took to get the final inspection after the 22 months had run.  Mr. Walton said they had been given 23 months due to the hurricanes and they were 5 months and 9 days beyond that.  Mr. Ballentine asked how far out they would be under the new rules.  Mr. Walton said they would be given 24 months which with the hurricane would be 25 months.  Mr. Lynch said that at the end of that 24 month period, if they had not sought an extension of time within the required time period, no earlier than 6 months and no later than 45 days, before the expiration of that 24 months, their project would have been shut down.  Mr. Wagner’s lack of knowledge of this particular situation would have become irrelevant because they would have been red tagged on the next day after the 24 month period.  Mr. Lynch said Mr. Wagner did not know because he has been a good corporate citizen and had never been before the Board except on one occasion which was beyond his control; it was a maintenance item on the Glazer house.  Mr. Walton said that situation was not due to Mr. Wagner’s fault, that he was just representing the owner.  \n\n          \n\n          Mr. Ballentine asked how Mr. Wagner did not know the Code requirement if he had built so many homes in the area and said he had difficulty with the ignorance of that. \n\n          \n\n          Mr. Fried said he agreed with Mr. Ballentine and found it hard to believe that Mr. Wagner did not know the time limits. He said some reduction should be considered but he was not sure on what basis.  \n\n          \n\n          Mr. Ochstein remarked that the fine was around $35,000 and the house was on the market for $10.6 million dollars so he did not see the hardship.  Mr. Lynch said he did not know the price but he would accept Mr. Ochstein’s statement on that.  Mr. Lynch said the hardship was in the imposition of the fine itself, there were mistakes made and he believed that Council would have given them a significant extension of time if Mr. Wagner had been aware of the situation and filed the proper notice with Town Council.  \n\n          \n\n          Mr. Lynch said if some sort of arrangement could be reached today, his client would be in a position to pay within the next two weeks.  Mr. Hoffman said he was concerned because he believed that when the case was originally heard, they had the option of fining $250.00 a day and they gave them a fine reduction at the time they initiated the fine of $125.00 a day.  Mr. Walton corrected Mr. Hoffman, advising there was a motion for a fine of $125.00 a day which failed and the fine that was in effect was $250.00 a day.  Mr. Lynch said he believed the record reflects something different than that.  Mr. Walton said his records reflect $250.00 a day but he would review it.  Mr. Walton reviewed the transcript and noted that it showed $125.00 a day but the Board order specified $250.00 a day and he would have to do further research.  \n\n          Mr. Fried advised he could make a motion to postpone the matter to the next meeting and have Mr. Walton bring back the correct information.  There was additional discussion about the amount of the fine and Mr. Lynch said he was seeking a reduction of the $17,125.00 which would be the amount of the fine if it was $125.00 a day.  Mr. Hoffman said he would find that hard to accept.  Mr. Hoffman read from the minutes that a motion was made by Mr. Fried that the defendant was found in non-compliance, ordered to pay an administrative fee in the amount of $150.00, obtain a final building inspection by October 25, 2008 and a fine of $125.00 to commence on October 26, 2007.  He said that motion passed 4-3.  Mr. Walton said he could not dispute that but he would have to do some research.  Mr. Hoffman said he would not be in favor of reducing the $17, 125.00 any further.  \n\n          \n\n          Mr. Ochstein said he was hesitant to do anything until they know what the number is.

She wanted to know if there was anything they could do as a Board in making a suggestion to the Council about an ordinance that could address people not pulling permits because of the safety issues in terms of multi-family dwellings.  Capt. Blouin said there was a provision in place.  If work is done without a permit, there is a penalty involved.  There was an ordinance drafted last year that requires them to pay four times the permit fee.  \n\n     \n\n     Mr. Fried asked Mr. Randolph if he had spoken to Mr. Elwell about the foreclosure action being brought to the Board’s area of responsibility as opposed to the Town Council. Mr. Randolph said he had but did not have an answer yet and would try to get one.  Mr. Fried asked Ms. Houston about progress on the fines and she said the Town was now inputting fines into the computer system and if someone had outstanding fines they could not get any permits. People are contacting Code Enforcement because they cannot get permits and are either paying or asking to come back to the Board for a fine reduction.  \n\n     \n\n     Capt. Blouin advised that with regard to any foreclosure action, the police department is scrutinizing each and every one of them as some of these cases we have liens on were pre-existing prior to coming to the police department.  We do not want to bring a case to the board that can be handled in a different manner.  \n\n     \n\n     Mr. Walton remarked that it was a good thing that there are a number of working without permit cases being brought to the Board, that it means Staff is doing their job.\n\n     \n\n\n\nX.\tAdjournment:\n\n     \n\n     The meeting was adjourned without benefit of a motion.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode Enforcement Board Meeting Minutes 07/17/08\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    2\n\n                    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n     \n\n\n\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

We’re speaking from Los Angeles today, right across the street from our\nheadquarters in Los Angeles. Um. I want to talk about wealth creation and what wealth\ncreation really can achieve and maybe take it in a slightly different direction, because I\nbelieve the world, and particularly the Judeo-Christian west, is in a crisis. And it’s really\nthe organizing principle of how we built Breitbart News to really be a platform to bring\nnews and information to people throughout the world. Principally in the west, but we’re\nexpanding internationally to let people understand the depths of this crisis, and it is a\ncrisis both of capitalism but really of the underpinnings of the Judeo-Christian west in\nour beliefs.\n\nIt’s ironic, I think, that we’re talking today at exactly, tomorrow, 100 years ago, at the\nexact moment we're talking, the assassination took place in Sarajevo of Archduke Franz\nFerdinand that led to the end of the Victorian era and the beginning of the bloodiest\ncentury in mankind’s history. Just to put it in perspective, with the assassination that\ntook place 100 years ago tomorrow in Sarajevo, the world was at total peace. There was\ntrade, there was globalization, there was technological transfer, the High Church of\nEngland and the Catholic Church and the Christian faith was predominant throughout\nEurope of practicing Christians. Seven weeks later, I think there were 5 million men in\nuniform and within 30 days there were over a million casualties.\n\nThat war triggered a century of barbaric — unparalleled in mankind’s history — virtually\n180 to 200 million people were killed in the 20th century, and I believe that, you know,\nhundreds of years from now when they look back, we’re children of that: We’re children\nof that barbarity. This will be looked at almost as a new Dark Age.\n\nBut the thing that got us out of it, the organizing principle that met this, was not just the\nheroism of our people — whether it was French resistance fighters, whether it was the\nPolish resistance fighters, or it’s the young men from Kansas City or the Midwest who\nstormed the beaches of Normandy, commandos in England that fought with the Royal Air\nForce, that fought this great war, really the Judeo-Christian West versus atheists, right?\n\nThe underlying principle is an enlightened form of capitalism, that capitalism really gave\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_029043\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

It applies not only to documents but to the secret knowledge that such a source is\nable to recall and includes both controlled and uncontrolled bearers of secrets. It is also a job\ndescription that fitted Edward Snowden in June 2013.\n\nUnless one is willing to believe that the Putin regime acted out of purely altruistic motives in\nexfiltrating this American intelligence worker to Moscow, the only plausible explanation for its\nactions in Hong Kong was that it valued Snowden’s potential as an espionage source.\n\nSnowden’s open disillusionment with the NSA presented the very situation that the Russian\nintelligence services specialized in exploiting. He had also revealed to reporters in Hong Kong\nthat he had deliberately gained access to the NSA’s sources and methods and he that he had taken\nto Hong Kong highly-classified documents. He further disclosed that, before leaving the NSA, he\nhad gained access to the lists of computers that the NSA had penetrated in foreign countries. He\neven went so far as to describe to these journalists the secrets that he had taken as a “single point\nof failure” for the NSA. And aside from the documents he had copied, he claimed, it will be\nrecalled, that he had secret knowledge in his head that, if disclosed would wreak havoc on the\nentire U.S. foreign intelligence system. “If I were providing information that I know, that’s in\nmy head, to some foreign government, the US intelligence community would ... see sources go\ndark that were previously productive, he told the editor of the Guardian in Moscow.\n\nIn short, he advertised possessing precisely the priceless data that the Russian intelligence\nservices had been seeking, with little success, for the past six decades. These electronic files could\nprovide it with the keys to unlock the NSA’s entire kingdom of electronic spying. Could any\nworld-class intelligence service ignore such a prize? To miss the opportunity to gets in hands such\na potential espionage source would be nothing short of gross negligence.\n\nIn fact, as has been already established in these pages, this golden opportunity was not missed in\nHong Kong. Even if the Russian intelligence service had not previously had him in its sights —\nwhich, as discussed in chapter XV, appears to me to be extremely unlikely-- he made contact with\nRussian officials in Hong Kong, and Putin, as he himself said, personally approved allowing\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_020369\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

Teaching future professors in one’s own field helps maintain\nthat status, so graduate students pursuing Ph.D.s are quite often taken\nvery seriously. Teaching graduate seminars is intellectually stimulat-\ning, may help with one’s own research, and is therefore worthwhile\nto do. But undergraduates are a whole different story. Very small per-\ncentages of them actually will become researchers in one’s field. Pro-\nfessors are in the fame game. They worry about the prestige of their\ndepartment and themselves. They care about this because they won’t\nattract high-quality Ph.D. students unless they maintain that prestige.\nUndergraduates do not figure into this equation. Except they do pay\nthe bills.\n\nSo professors have to teach them. And, someone has to teach those\ndamn introductory courses that typically have hundreds of students\nin them. Why do they have hundreds of students in them? Because\nno one wants to teach them so making the sections as large as possible\nmeans fewer professors will have to teach them. And, why does our\naerospace guy want high school to teach the math his students need?\nBecause he certainly doesn’t want to do it.

Solution—make sure math\nis taught in high school.\n\nThis solution makes everyone in the university happy. And, it\nshouldn’t be a big surprise that the original idea of requiring alge-\nbra of high school students came from the president of Harvard and\nthe chairman of the Princeton Math Department (in 1892).

That is, no one inside or\nconnected to the university should be retained to provide a truly independent, honest assessment of the\nsituation.\n\nSo it was that Pepper Hamilton, a respected Philadelphia law firm, was retained. Their work began in\nearly September 2015, and came to conclusion in May 2016. To assure the independence of its work,\nthe Pepper Hamilton lawyers reported directly to a special three-person committee of Baylor’s Board of\nRegents.

The final work\nproduct was two-fold: a set of findings of fact, reported by the Board of Regents, and a lengthy set of\nrecommendations from the law firm. There was no “report” in the traditional sense.

The criticisms were directed atincluded what | call “first responders,” including\ncampus law enforcement, health services and counseling. Pepper Hamilton’s findings were summarized\nas a “fundamental failure” on the part of the University. This quickly became the prevailing narrative.\nThe narrative was reinforced by additional victims coming forward — some of whom had graduated —\nabout their tragic experiences. These were chronicled in dramatic ways by ESPN’s go-for-the-jugular\nprogram, “Outside the Lines.” Baylor — not just the football program — became a pariah.\n\nVictims’ stories moved the thoughtful observer or listener to a powerful combination of empathy and\noutrage. One’s heart goes out to the victim; a second later, waves of outrage wash over the empathetic\nobserver. How could this have happened? Who fell asleep at the switch? Who failed to protect these\nyoung women, and why? Did coaches turn a blind eye to reports of unconscionable acts by superstar\nplayers — or even non-superstars who abused (or worse) young women?.

What causes us to lose our sense of moderation, allow\nour mental brakes to slip, and give in to temptation? What causes our preferences to inconsistently and\nirrationally shift over time, allowing seductive offerings to win? If you are the eminent social\npsychologist Roy Baumeister who has contributed fundamental insights into the nature of evil, the answer\nis simple: sugar. Love it. Want it. Need it.\n\nWhen we work hard, focusing on a difficult problem or trying to figure out the best decision,\nexhaustion strikes. Part of our exhaustion comes from the fact that we have depleted a critical resource:\nsugar, or more precisely, glucose. When the availability of this resource diminishes, we also lose self-\ncontrol. This is why the loss of self-control has a cycle that follows the time of day, with the greatest\nlosses occurring late rather than early: diet breakers are more likely to pig out in the evening than early in\nthe morning; shoppers are more likely to buy impulsively as the day moves on; impulsive crimes and\nrelapses of addiction are evening affairs; judges are more likely to dole out punishment at the end of a day\nin court than when they start a new day. Dozens of experiments show that if you have to exert self-\ncontrol in one context it taxes your capacity to exert self-control in another. For example, if you ask\nsubjects to avoid laughing while watching a comedy routine, avoid thinking about a white bear, or avoid\neating chocolates now to have radishes later, these same subjects will squeeze a hand grip for a shorter\nperiod of time than subjects who never contended with the various self-control tasks. When you deplete\nyour personal resources, you lose your grip, opening yourself up to binge eating, unnecessary violence,\nsexual promiscuity, and drug relapses.\n\nHow do we know that glucose is responsible? If you give people a milkshake with real sugar\nbefore they have to take a hard test involving self-control, they do better than if you give them a\nmilkshake with an artificial sweetener. If you first make people take a test that taxes their attention, and\ncauses their glucose to drop, they do worse on a subsequent test, including the hand grip squeezing test. In\nan extraordinary series of experiments and observations, the American psychologist Nathan DeWall\nfound that subjects who drank lemonade with glucose were less likely to respond aggressively to an insult\nthan subjects who drank lemonade with artificial sweetener; individuals with diabetes — who have\ndifficulty regulating blood glucose, and thus have less of it— reported higher levels of aggression on a\nquestionnaire than non-diabetics; within the United States, those states with higher numbers of diabetics\nshowed higher crime rates; and countries with a higher frequency of a genetic disorder that lowers\n\nglucose levels showed higher killing rates both in and out of war.\n\nHauser Chapter 4.

And I was just wondering what you would recommend to counteract these\nmovements, which are growing.\n\nBannon: One of the reasons that you can understand how they’re being fueled is that\nthey’re not seeing the benefits of capitalism. I mean particularly — and I think it’s\nparticularly more advanced in Europe than it is in the United States, but in the United\nStates it’s getting pretty advanced — is that when you have this kind of crony capitalism,\nyou have a different set of rules for the people that make the rules. It’s this partnership of\nbig government and corporatists. I think it starts to fuel, particularly as you start to see\nnegative job creation. If you go back, in fact, and look at the United States’ GDP, you look\nat a bunch of Europe. If you take out government spending, you know, we’ve had negative\ngrowth on a real basis for over a decade.\n\nAnd that all trickles down to the man in the street. If you look at people’s lives, and\nparticularly millennials, look at people under 30 — people under 30, there’s 50% really\nunder employment of people in the United States, which is probably the most advanced\neconomy in the West, and it gets worse in Europe.\n\nI think in Spain it’s something like 50 or 60% of the youth under 30 are underemployed.\nAnd that means the decade of their twenties, which is where you have to learn a skill,\nwhere you have to learn a craft, where you really start to get comfortable in your\nprofession, you’re taking that away from the entire generation. That’s only going to fuel\ntribalism, that’s only going to fuel [unintelligible]... That’s why to me, it’s incumbent upon\nfreedom-loving people to make sure that we sort out these governments and make sure\nthat we sort out particularly this crony capitalism so that the benefits become more of this\nentrepreneurial spirit and that can flow back to working-class and middle-class people.\nBecause if not, we’re going to pay a huge price for this. You can already start to see it.\nQuestioner: I have a question, because you worked on Wall Street. What is the opinion\nthere on whether they think bank bailouts are justified?

[jeevacation@gmail.com]; Richard Kahn\nSubject: Meet with our Global Head of Commodities - Monday at 10:15am at One Bryant Park\n\nAttachments: image001.png\n\nImportance: — High\n\nPlease let me know if you’re interested in joining a small group meeting with our head of Global Commodities. Apologies\nfor the short notice but they just created this based on client request.\n\n° Monday, January 30 at 10:15am at One Bryant Park (42\" St & 6\" Ave), Room 5F\n\nFrancisco Blanch is a managing director and head of Global Commodities and Derivatives Research. Regular Research\npublications include: The Global Energy Weekly, Commodity Portfolio Monthly and Quantitative Investment Strategies\nMonthly. Research produced by the Commodities, Asset Allocation, and Global Derivatives teams has been recognized\nby Institutional Investor, Extel, Greenwich, Bloomberg, or Energy Risk, among others. Previously he was Head of Global\nAsset Allocation Research. Prior to joining Merrill Lynch, Blanch was an energy economist focusing on global oil & gas in\nthe commodity research group at Goldman Sachs & Co. and consulted for the European Commission and other public\nand private organizations. Blanch has a masters degree in public administration from Harvard University and a\ndoctorate in economics from Complutense University of Madrid.\n\nKey topics of discussion:\n\n1 — OPEC / Saudi Policy - OPEC agreed to cut production by 1.2mb/d, along with 600kb/d from non-OPEC\n\nproducers. Francisco believes Saudi’s key objective will be to push the oil forward curve into backwardation to 1)lower\nglobal refinery margins 2) lower prices for forward sellers and prevent capex spending 3) reduce downside oil price\nrisks. Francisco believes it is in OPEC’s best interest to comply with the stated cuts, and thins Saudi remains under\nsignificant pressure to either achieve higher oil prices, or inevitably de-peg the Riyal.\n\n2 - Oil fundamentals - OPEC’s cut has significant implications for supply/demand balances and throws the global market\ninto a meaningful deficit for 2017. We estimate the global market will be in a 560kb/d deficit throughout 2017. US\nShale output remains a headwind for a rebound in global balances and will vary with price. Given our $59/bbl 2017\noutlook for WTI, Francisco believes shale will reverse its current trend before rebounding sequentially by 660kb/d\nbetween 2Q17 and 4Q17.\n\n3 — US Energy Policy / Trump Administration — Francisco views the likelihood for Trump’s administration to implement a\nborder adjustment tax to be extremely low, but recognizes that if a tax was imposed, it would have profound\nimplications for EM demand and the WTI/Br arb. The appointment of key cabinet members Rex Tillerson, Rick Perry,\nand Scott Pruitt pose significant implications for the US energy sector.\n\n4 — Commodity Macro — Forward inflation expectations around the world have jumped sharply since Trump’s\nvictory. So far, rising inflation and steeper yield curves have neutralized the strong dollar, pushing commodities\nhigher. We believe the recent breakdown in USD/Oil correlation since OPEC/Fed can persist so long as inflation\nexpectations remain supported. However, a toxic mix of much faster-than-anticipated US interest rate hikes, a much\nstronger USD, and a trade war with China pose risks.\n\nAmanda Ens\n\nDirector\n\nBank of America Merrill Lynch\n\nMerrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated\nOne Bryant Park, 5th Floor, New York, NY 10036\n\nPhone: V obilc: i’\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_014695\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

Two other eyewitnesses have\nconfirmed the complainant's account of what happened.\n\n° In April 2017, the complainant described the incident on her blog.

However, Cynthia Jewett, the university’s senior associate general counsel,\nnoted that two individuals, neither affiliated with the university, had complained about you. “The University did\n\nnot find either communication to state a credible allegation,” Jewett wrote.\n\nMiscellaneous facts:\n\n° In 2008, you founded the Origins Project at Arizona State University in Tempe, a multidisciplinary effort\nto understand the origins of the universe, life, and social systems. You have led that effort ever since.\n\ne Thanks to best-selling books like The Physics of Star Trek and A Universe From Nothing, frequent\nessays in publications including the New Yorker and the New York Times, and the documentary you made with\nbiologist Richard Dawkins, called The Unbelievers, you are celebrated as one of America’s leading public\nintellectuals.\n\n° You served on the science policy committee for Barack Obama’s 2008 presidential campaign and are a\nvocal critic of President Donald Trump.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_031253\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

Re asking her for dinner.. I have gone back over\nemails from that period. I have numerous requests from her asking me to go for coffee to talk, which I usually\nhad to turn down because I was busy, and on several occasions sh specifically asked me to have coffee with her\noff campus to talk, and I politely declined. I did let her accompany me off campus one time to watch me do a\nBBC interview because she specifically requested it. I did and do have coffee and meals with students on\ncampus, and I see nothing wrong with this. I try to treat even students as respected colleagues if possible. I was\nshocked when I later learned of the complaint she was apparently asked to lodge to the University, not least\nbecause there was no inappropriate interaction and also because, well after the dates you listed on which she\nwas apparently offended, she continued to email me with joking questions or comments. Also, at a later AAAS\nconference, again in 2008, for which she had asked, and for which I had written her a letter of recommendation\nto attend, my wife and I gave her a lift in our taxi well out out of our way in order to drop her off at her hotel,\nand I note in an email response to her email about the conference, agin in 2008, I expressed that I would pass\nher regards along to my wife and vice versa. When the University later informed me of the complaint I was\nshocked and concerned. When I spoke to the human resources person, including relating my concerns and\nproviding the emails in question, I was told that no formal complaint of sexual harassment was deemed at that\ntime to be called for, and that the young woman in question had agreed to that. By that time I learned of the\ncomplaint I had already announced my intentions to leave Case to accept an offer at ASU—a very difficult\ndecision for me because of my long-standing attachment to the University, and the excellent relations I had with\nmy colleagues there, both among the faculty and among the administration. Because I was already in Arizona\nat the time I was asked not to have any further interaction with the student I agreed to that request, both to\nrespect her sensitivities and also because it was basically moot because I was not on campus. I was also told\nthat because it was being handled informally, that (a) it should remain confidential, which I, at least abided by,\nand (b) if no further complaints were lodged in that case, that the University would remove the complaint from\nmy record after 5 years, which makes me surprised that someone violated that written agreement with you.\n\nRe item 6: You report on ASU’s response to item #6 , without including the fact that the University specifically\nstated there were never any allegations of sexual misconduct or harassment by me at the University, and\nmorever the outside complaints were in fact related specifically to your item #6. Further you neglect to\nmention that this complaint was by an anonymous third party, not the individual who was allegedly harassed,\nwho never lodged a complain, and that no specific evidence was provided of the alleged transgression. I was\nsurprised and dismayed that both ASU and ANU launched investigations on the basis of this but was told by\nboth Universities that because of my high profile even such unsubstantiated third party complaints at private\nevents unrelated to the University would be investigated. The complaint was investigated throughly by both\nASU and ANU and both came to the conclusion that it was not credible and no university policies had been\nviolated. . In addition ANU’s investigation, which took a full month found significant inconsistencies in the\nallegation, suggesting distortion and fabrication, I will quote from the ANU report. The initial complaint, which\nin fact resulted in a temporary suspension of my position at ANU, until it was dismissed, outlined the claim you\nmade in the words you quoted in your note to me, but it also stated\n\n\"It is the University’s understanding that a complaint was lodged directly to the conference organisers at the\ntime of the incident.”\n\nAfter the month-long investigation, during which I was told I was not to interact with anyone on campus (again\nmoot because I was a hemisphere removed) the final report absolved me of any wrongdoing, and indicated\ninformation inconsistent with the original claim and apparent later claims as follows in the report, from which I\nquote:\n\n\"The allegations were made by an observer to the incident.\n\n- The complaint did not identify, nor disclose the identity of the conference attendee who was allegedly touched\nin\n\nan unwelcome manner.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_031247\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

Carson, US Economist and Director—Global Economic Research, joe.carson@abglobal.com\nPresident Trump has promised to increase defense spending—and\nthere’s support from key members of Congress. If a large multiyear\nplan is approved, it would represent a sharp reversal from what has\nbeentheweakesttrendindefensespendinginthepast50years.\nAnd the timing and scale would have important implications for the\noutlook on growth and inflation.\nNational Defense—The Trump Plan\nPresident Trump has promised to deliver\nan ambitious program to rebuild the US\nmilitary. It would include modernizing\nUS nuclear weapons systems, investing\nmore in cybersecurity, enlarging the navy’s\nfleet and increasing the number of fighter\naircraft for the air force. Trump’s plan also\nincludes additional military personnel—well\nover 100,000, according to some\nestimates.\nThe details of Trump’s first Pentagon\nbudget will form part of the overall budget\nhe’ll submit to Congress in late February or\nearly March. The actual funding request for\nthe current fiscal year (which ends\nSeptember 30) must be completed by April\n30—that’s when the current legislation\nfunding the military budget is set to expire.\nMore important, Trump’s blueprint for the\nPentagon budget could set the baseline\nfor defense spending for at least the next\nfour years. It’s also worth noting that\nTrump’s military expenditures could be at\nthe low end of what some in Congress are\nproposing.\nFor example, Senator John McCain, who\nchairs the Senate Armed Services\nCommittee, recently released a white\npaper on defense spending, Restoring\nAmerican Power. McCain argues that the\nUS has underinvested in the military for\nseveral years, and that it is now vital for\nthe US to substantially increase funding for\nthe Pentagon. His plan calls for a $640\nbillion defense budget for fiscal year 2018,\nwhich is $58 billion above the current\nbudget baseline. Moreover, the McCain\ndefense plan urges an additional $430\nbillion in military spending over the next\nfive fiscal years.\nDefense Spending Patterns Are Unlike\nOther Federal Programs\nHistory shows that defense spending\nprograms are unusual in that they’re neither\ncyclical nor countercyclical. Most often they\nare based on military and political strategiesaswellasongoingreadinessto\nrespond to or engage in global encounters.\nBased on historical gross domestic\nproduct (GDP) data, there have been three\nlarge defense-spending programs in the\npast 50 years (Display 1). The first buildup\nDisplay 1\nDefense Spending Comes in Big Waves\nYoY % Change\n80\n70\n60\n50\n40\n30\n20\n10\n0\n(10)\nNominal Defense Spending\nVietnam\nWar\nReagan\nBuildup\nIraq\nWar\n(20)\n64 72 81 90 98 07 16\nTrump?\nThrough September 30, 2016\nFour-year moving average\nSource: Bureau of Economic Analysis and Haver Analytics\noccurred in the mid-1960s, during\nPresident Lyndon Johnson’s term, and ran\nfor five years. That was tied to the military\nengagement in Southeast Asia.\nThe second large defense-spending boom\noccurred during the first four years of the\nReagan presidency. This buildup was part\nof Reagan’s political and military strategy\nto rebuild the military apparatus after what\nhe saw as years of neglect.\nThe third major increase started during the\nfirst term of President George W. Bush.\nThis one was linked to events surrounding\n9/11 and the following events in the\nMiddle East.\n1\nFrom a political and military standpoint, the\nTrump defense plan parallels the goals and\nobjectives of President Reagan’s military\npush. And with McCain’s more aggressive\nplan aligned on the same premise of\nmodernizing and improving the readiness\nof the US military, Trump will likely have the\nbacking of this influential member of the\nRepublican congressional leadership.\nToday’s Economic Backdrop—\nSimilar to the 1960s\nThe economic and financial implications of\na large, multiyear defense-spending plan\nmust be weighed against the economic\nenvironment at the time of implementation.\nAnd from a historical context, today’s\nconditions have more similarities to the\neconomic setting of the mid-1960s than\nduring the defense buildups of the early\n1980s or early 2000s, which were either\nin recession or the very early stages of\nrecovery.\nIncontrast,theUSeconomyinthemid-\n1960swasalreadyinitsfifthyearof\nexpansion, the jobless rate of 4.5% was\nrelatively low and inflation was tame\n(roughly 1.5%). Nonetheless, the extra\ndefense spending boosted domestic\ndemand growth and added significant\npressure to labor costs, materials and\nsupplies, and product prices. So much so\nthat the acceleration in consumer price\ninflation(from1%in1961tonear6%in\n1970)fromthestarttotheendofthat\nbusinesscyclewasoneofthelargestof\nany economic growth cycle during the\npostwar period.\nToday’s economic backdrop looks similar in\nmany ways. The economy has been in\nrecovery for seven years, the jobless rate is\nin the mid-4% range and inflation is stable\n(at around 2%). While many domestic and\nglobal factors are different now, we would\nstill expect a large multiyear defensespending\nprogram to add to growth and\nput upward pressure on labor costs and\ninflation in the coming years. Keep in mind\nthat we’re coming off the weakest five-year\ndefense spending trend in the past 50\nyears, so Trump’s defense spending need\nnot match any of the prior three to have a\nmajor impact.\nStay tuned for the unveiling of Trump’s\nbudget and pay close attention to the\ndefense spending request. A large\nmulti-year program would definitely lift\ninflationary pressures. While we wouldn’t\nexpect an acceleration like that in the\n1960s, a sustained rise of 100 to 200\nbasis points in general inflation would still\nseem reasonable—and far above what the\nFederal Reserve and financial markets are\ncurrently expecting. n\nThe information contained herein reflects the views of AllianceBernstein L.P. or its affiliates and sources it believes are reliable as of the date of this publication.\nAllianceBernstein L.P. makes no representations or warranties concerning the accuracy of any data.

Freshwater economists argue plausibly that they are likely to\nprove ineffective. They foresee “rational expectations” of taxpayers as predicting\neventual restoration of the taxes when full employment resumes. This gives a\nmotive to save the tax cut rather than spend it as intended. | see it a little differently.\nMost consumption is maintenance or investment to keep up human capital. We will\n\nneed that earning power when taxes are restored.\n\nSay’s Law\n\nJean Baptiste Say, in writings I haven’t read, argued two centuries ago that supply\ncreates its own demand. The logic is sound to a point. The claims on output simplify\nto pay plus profit. The asterisks don’t matter here. Thus pay plus profit is always\nenough to clear that market. There could be “partial gluts” when we produced too\nmuch of one thing and not enough of another, but never a “general glut” where\n\nproduction got ahead of our means to pay for it.\n\nAll too true. Consumption plus investment equals pay plus profit. But the sad fact is\nthat profit can be negative. Deadweight loss happens. When it happens, at the\ncollective scale, even pay claims may be left unsatisfied. Say’s law gives no comfort\n\nexcept where outcomes are as expected.\n\nTax Considerations\n\nSchultz in 1962 argued that educational (human) capital is overtaxed. What he\nwrote was: “The established tax treatment takes account of both depreciation and\nobsolescence in the case of physical capital, but this accounting is not extended to\nhuman capital”. He was right. Income tax is charged on net profit of firms and pay of\n\nworkers. Pay measures gross realized work including human depreciation.\n\nTax laws now counter that imbalance by applying lower rates to pay as “earned\n\nincome”. If we could measure human depreciation, or model it with enough\n\nChapter 8 Banks, Money and Macroeconomics 2/8/16 19\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_011108\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

Plaintiffs Are Entitled to Jurisdic-\ntional Discovery as to Privatbank’s\nInvesting Activities in the United\nStates\n\n[37] Plaintiffs point out that Privat-\nbank’s website and its 2001 Annual Report\nstate that Privatbank engages in transac-\ntions involving securities issued in the\nUnited States.

See\nAerogroup Intl, Inc., 956 F.Supp. at 489.\n\nBecause plaintiffs have identified a gen-\nuine issue of jurisdictional fact, the ques-\ntion of general jurisdiction cannot be re-\nsolved on the pleadings and affidavits\nalone.

Peggy\nSiegal takes us behind the scenes where she got herself on camera along with a few of her famous friends. Nice work if you can get\nit.\n\nIn 1987, right after director Oliver Stone won the Academy Award for \"Platoon,” he immediately turned to a domestic arena\nand began working on \"Wall Street\" in New York City where his father had been a stockbroker. Although the film was widely seen\nas a scathing critique of the culture of Wall Street, Stone has said that part of the film is a defense of capitalism, his father's vision of\nfinance (as seen through the Hal Holbrook character) and an homage to his father.\n\nAt the time Oliver was also fascinated with the connection between the psyche of Latino Miami drug dealers from his earlier\n\"Scarface\" script and the American-born 28- to 35-year-old, white collar stockbrokers. Both groups had an animalistic need to obtain\nbig and fast money. They shared an obsession with corruption and greed.\n\nOliver sent his actors to Bear Stearns for research, including then-newcomer Charlie Sheen, who played Bud Fox, a kid from\nnowhere. When he learns to cold call, and lands one big client, Gordon Gekko, Fox is thrust into the fast lane with a rock star\nfinancial mentor who teaches him corruption.\n\nOliver needed an old-fashioned villain to create drama, and he cast Michael Douglas as Gekko against type. Michael was not\nknown as a heavy at the time, but as a charming, handsome, sensitive leading man. Oliver also saw the anger, confidence,\nsalesmanship and style that Michael brought to the role. Michael's Gekko looked a bit like Laker's coach Pat Riley with his slicked\nback hair and well-cut suits, and it became Michael’s most important role, winning him the Academy Award for the villain no one\ncould ever forget.\n\nWhen Gekko delivers his speech, \"Greed, for lack of a better word, is good. Greed is right. Greed works,” cinematic history was\nmade.\n\n“Wall Street” was set in 1985, a time before ten financial news networks broadcasting 24/7 existed. The entire financial services\nindustry was largely unknown and Oliver Stone nailed it.\n\nFour years ago, Wall Street’s producer Ed Pressman decided it was time for a sequel and met with Fox Film Entertainment co-\nchairmen Tom Rothman and Jim Gianopulos. Michael Douglas was immediately on-board pending script approval. Steven Schiff\nwrote the first script before the global economic crash of 2008 rendered it obsolete.\n\nAlan Loeb was brought in for a rewrite. Pressman asked me to meet Loeb at the Carlyle Hotel to explain the social rhythms of\nNew York’s financial high society. Whereas Gekko’s character was modeled after ‘70s junk bond kings (Michael Milken) and ‘80s\nmergers and acquisitions killers (Henry Kravis), Loeb bases the new villain on hedge fund billionaires like John Paulson and Mike\nNovogratz, geniuses who have created stratospheric wealth beyond Gordon Gekko’s wildest dreams. When Oliver Stone agreed to\ndirect, he rewrote a portion of the script to focus on bankers as well as hedge funders, taking no screen credit.\n\nThis past September, Oliver yelled, \"action\" as Gordon Gekko, with long grey hair, comes back to life as he emerges from a\nlengthy prison stint shot outside of Sing Sing in Ossining, New York. Gekko is desperate to redefine himself in a different era. The\nNew York Post runs a full-page photo of Gekko and New Yorkers immediately become obsessed with the filming of Wall Street 2.\n\nA week into shooting, a glorious fall day. Ed Pressman invites me on the set at the Central Park Zoo. Oliver designs an elaborate\ntracking shot around the seal pool where Gekko, fresh from jail, walks and talks to Jake Moore, a young idealistic investment banker\nplayed by Shia LaBoeuf. They discuss Gekko’s daughter Winnie, Moore’s fiancée, played by Carrie Mulligan, who is also having an\noff-screen romance with LaBoeuf. Oliver played Cupid. Moore invites Gekko to the Alzheimer's Ball at the Metropolitan Museum\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_032000\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

Since the secrecy of the mission had to be preserved,\nwe couldn’t make advance preparations for refueling or the additional 707\nwhich we intended to fly in as a field hospital. But he smoothed the way for us\nto do both, without anyone asking too many questions.\n\nThe Mossad men took the lead in arranging to get Rabin’s questions\nanswered. They contacted a pilot they knew. The pilot flew to Entebbe early on\nSaturday morning, circled, and, after he was cleared to land, claimed\nmechanical difficulties and flew out again. I had his telephoto pictures by mid-\nmorning and phoned Rabin’s intelligence officer to let him know we’d\nconfirmed there was a clear path to the old terminal. We still had to make sure\nthe captive passengers were there, however. A nurse from Kampala who had\nbeen allowed to visit them made three further visits: late Saturday afternoon,\nthen shortly after the first Hercules had taken off from Sharm al-Sheikh, and\nfinally around nine at night. I was able to reassure Rabin that the question to his\nsecond question was also “yes”. Although all of the C-130s were already\nairborne, it was only then that he gave the mission the final go-ahead.\n\nAs commander of Sayeret Matkal, Pd always found running an operation\nfrom a command post hugely frustrating. This was even worse. Once we got\nword the Israeli force was on the way to Uganda, we put in place the\narrangements for refueling. If all went well, the first C-130, with Yont’s assault\nteam and at least some of the hostages, was due to reach Entebbe and begin the\nassault at midnight Saturday. Assuming there were no major problems, it would\ntake an hour at most. All / could do now, from 300 miles away, was wait.\n\nShortly after midnight, Kuti radioed me with a terse message: the first of the\nHercules had left Entebbe for Nairobi, and the command plane was returning to\nIsrael. About quarter to one in the morning on July 4, the transport planes began\ntheir staggered arrival. When the first Hercules taxied to a halt, I went out to\nmeet it.

Meanwhile, number of private sector\ncompanies has significantly increased as well. How do you see this impacting the UAE\nnationals’ job opportunities?

I am positive\nthat most of the private sector companies prefer to recruit UAE nationals as part of their Corporate Social\nResponsibilities. Also salaries of UAE nationals — however high they may appear to be - are far less than those\nof expats. Employing a UAE national will open the door for more interaction with government departments and\nlocal customers, who are eventually the highest spenders.

This encouraged many expats to reside in the UAE for long\nperiod of time, evolving the same habits and traditions of the local community as well as\nsignificant loyalty to this country. Some of those expats felt optimistic about recent\nannouncements made by some real estate companies that property buyers in certain\nprojects in Dubai or Ajman will be offered “permanent UAE residency.” Other\ncompanies have completely closed the door of speculation regarding the same issue.

We isolate and\nreview key expense and revenue drivers. On the expense side, we examine the major\nentitlement programs (Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security) as well as defense and other\nmajor discretionary programs. On the revenue side, we focus on GDP growth (driven by labor\nproductivity and employment in the long run) and tax policies.\n\nWe present basic numbers-driven scenarios for addressing USA Inc.'s financial challenges.

We have\nseen a sharp increase in the last couple\nof years in what are deemed to be\nmajor economically significant rules.\nThat is defined as regulations that impose\na cost on the economy of $100 million\nor more.\nAccording to the administration's Office\nof Management and Budget, the\ncurrent administration has been regu-\nIating at a pace of 84 major rules per\nyear. By way of comparison, that is\nabout a 50-percent increase over the\nregulatory output during the Clinton\nadministration, which had about 56\nrules per year, and an increase from\nthe Bush administration as well. So we\nhave seen more regulations and more\nsignificant regulations.\nI was encouraged to hear President\nObama's words when he talked about\nthe Executive order in January, which\nis entitled \"Improving Regulation and\nRegulatory Review.\" But now we need\nto see action. We need to see it from\nthe administration, from individual\nagencies to provide real regulatory relief\nfor job creators to be able to reduce\nthis drag on the economy.\nOne commonsense step we can take is\nto strengthen what is called the Unfunded\nMandates Relief Act. It was\npassed in 1995. It was bipartisan. I was\na cosponsor in the House of Representatives.\nIt is an effort to require Federal\nregulators to evaluate the cost of rules,\nto look at the benefits and the costs,\nand to look at less costly alternatives\non rules.\nThe two amendments I would like to\noffer over the next few days as we consider\nthe legislation before us would\nimprove this Unfunded Mandates Reform\nAct, and it would reform it in\nways that are entirely consistent with\nthe principle President Obama has laid\nout and committed to in his Executive\norder on regulatory review.\nThe first amendment would require\nagencies specifically to assess potential\neffects of new regulations on job\ncreation-so focusing in on jobs-and\nto consider market-based and nongovernmental\nalternatives to regulation.\nThis would broaden the scope of\nthe Unfunded Mandates Relief Act to\nrequire cost-benefit analysis of rules\nthat impose direct or indirect costs of\n$100 miilion a year or more. So, again,\nthis is for major rules of $100 million or\nmore. It would also require agencies to\nadopt the least costly or least burdensome\noption that achieves whatever\npolicy goals have been set out by Congress.\nIt seems to me it is a commonsense\namendment. I hope we will get\nbipartisan support for it.\nThe second amendment would extend\nthe Unfunded Mandates Relief Act to\nso-called independent agencies which\ntoday are actually exempt from the\nCONGRESSIONAL RECORD\n- SENATE\ncost-benefit rules that govern aII other\nagencies. In 1995, we had this debate\nand determined at that time we would\nnot extend the legislation to independent\nagencies. In the interim, independent\nagencies have been providing\nmore and more rules, have put out\nmore and more regulations, and are\nhaving a bigger and bigger impact. An\nexample of an independent agency\nwould be the SEC, the Securities and\nExchange Commission, or the CFTC,\nwhich is the Commodity Futures Trading\nCommission. These are agencies\nthat, although independent in the executive\nbranch, are very much involved\nin putting out major rules and regulations.\nIt is sometimes called the \"headless\nfourth branch\" of government because\ntheir rules are not reviewed for\ncost-benefit analysis, even by the OMB,\nthe Office of Management and Budget,\nin its Office of Information and Regulatory\nAffairs, so-called OIRA.\nWe have looked at some GAO data\nand put together various studies, and it\nappears to us that there are about 200\nregulations that were issued between\n1996 until today that would be deemed\nto have an impact of $100 million or\nmore on the economy but were automatically\nexcluded from the Unfunded\nMandates Relief Act because they were\ndeemed to be from independent agencies.\nSo it is basically closing a loophole\nand closing this independent agency\nloophole, which I believe is a sensible\nreform. It has been endorsed by many\npeople, including, interestingly, the\ncument OIRA Administrator and the\nPresident's regulatory czat, Cass\nSunstein, who, in a2002 Law Review article,\ntalked about the fact that this is\nan area where UMRA ought to be extended\nbecause, again, there were so\nmany independent agencies that were\nputting out regulations impacting job\ncreation in this country.\nNo regulation, whatever its source,\nshould be imposed on American employers\nor on State and local governments\nwithout serious consideration of\nthe costs, the benefits, and the availability\nof a least-burdensome alternative.\nBoth these amendments would\nmove us further toward that sensible\ngoal, and I hope the leadership will\nallow these amendments to be offered.\nI think they fit well with the underlying\nlegislation. If they are offered, I\ncertainly urge my colleagues on both\nsides of the aisle to support them.\nI yield the floor. I suggest the absence\nof a quorum.\nThe PRESIDING OFFICER. The\nclerk will call.\nThe bill clerk proceeded to caII the\nroII.\nMr. DURBIN. Mr. President. I ask\nunanimous consent that the order for\nthe quorum call be rescinded.\nThe PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I\nrise today to recognize a distinguished\nKentuckian who has worked tirelessly\non behalf of our Nation's soldiers, sailors\nand marines for more than 40 years.\nLouis E. Givan, a lifelong resident of\nmy hometown of Louisville, has played\na vital role in protecting the men and\nwomen of our Armed Forces and our\ncountry's defense.\nFormerly a sailor himself in the U.S.\nNavy, he has served for the last 11\nyears as the general manager of\nRaytheon Missile Systems operations\nin Louisville. I was saddened to hear of\nhis retirement from that position this\ncoming July 5. He will certainly be\nmissed.\nMr. Givan-or, to those who know\nhim, Ed-was a 1966 graduate of St. Xavier\nHigh Schooi in Louisville and in\n1970 earned his bachelor of science degree\nin mechanical engineering from\nthe J.B. Speed School of Engineering\nat the University of Louisville. In 1968,\nhe began working at the Naval Ordnance\nStation in Louisville, and he\nstayed at that post until 1996, in various\nengineering and supervisory positions.\nIn 1996 the Naval Ordnance Station\ntransitioned to private ownership, and\nEd's leadership was crucial in making\nthat transition a successful one. The\nfacility eventually became part of\nRaytheon Missile Systems, and Ed was\nappointed general manager in 2000. As\ngeneral manager, Ed has led Raytheon\nMissile Systems in Louisville to great\nsuccess, success for both the company\nand for the local community. They design,\ndevelop, and produce vital weapons\nsystems for our armed forces, enabling\nAmerica to have the most formidable\nmilitary force in the world.\nWeapons produced at the Louisville facility\nare used by our forces in all parts\nof the globe, including in Iraq.\nKentucky is lucky to have benefitted\nfrom Ed's dedication, commitment to\nexcellence, and leadership for so many\nyears. I am sure his wife Velma; his\nsons Eddie, Tony, and Chris; and his\ngrandchildren Benjamin, Nathan,\nIsaac, Macy and Natalie are all very\nproud of what Ed has accomplished. I\nwish him the very best in retirement,\nand I am sure my colleagues join me in\nsaying that this U.S. Senate thanks\nMr. Louis E. \"Ed\" Givan for his faithful\nservice.\nCRIME VICTIMS' RIGHTS ACT\nMr. KYL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous\nconsent that the following letter\nbe printed in the Rncono.\nThere being no objection, the material\nwas ordered to be printed in the\nRncono. as follows:\nCase 9:08-cv-80736-KAM Document 85-1 Entered on FLSD Docket 06/17/2011 Page 3 of 4\ns3608\nU.S. Ssllero,\nWashington, DC, June 6, 2011.\nHon. ERIC H. HOLDER. Jr..\nAttmneA General\\ U.S. Department of Justice,\nWashington, DC.\nDEAR ATTORNEY GENERAL HoLDER: I am\nwriting about the Justice Department's implementation\nof the Crime Victims' Rishts\nAcb-an act that I co-sponsored in 2004.\nThese questions relate to an Office of Legal\nCounsel (\"OLC'1) Opinion made public on\nMay 20, 2011 and more broadly to concerns I\nhave heard from crime victims' advocates\nthat the Department has been thwarting effective\nimplementation of the Act by failing\nto extend the Act to the investigative phases\nof criminal cases and by preventing effective\nappellate enforcement of victims' rights. I\nam writing to ask you to answer these questions\nand explain the Department's actions\nin these areas.\nGOVERNMENT PROTECTION OF VICTIMS' RIGIITS\nDURING INVESTIGATION OF A CRIME\nWhen Congress enacted the CVRA, it intended\nto protect crime victims throughout\nthe criminal justice process-from the investigative\nphases to the final conclusion of a\ncase. Congress could not have been clearer in\nits direction that using \"best efforts\" to enforce\nthe CVRA was an obligation of\n\"[o]fficers and employees of the Department\nof Justice and other departments and agencies\nof the United States engaged in the detection,\ninaestigd,tion, or prosecution of crime\n. . . .\" 18 U.S.C. 93771(c)(1) (emphasis added).\nCongress also permitted crime victims to assert\ntheir rights either in the court in which\nformal charges had already been filed ,,or, if\nno prosecution is underwag, in the district\ncourt in the district in which the crime occurred.\"\n18 U.S.C. gBZTI(dXB) (emphasis\nadded).\nDespite Congress'clear intention to extend.\nrights to crime victims throughout the process,\nthe Justice Department is read.ing the\nCVRA much more narrowly. In the recent\nOLC opinion, for example, the Department\ntakes the position that ,,the CVRA is best\nread as providing that the rights identified\nin section 3771(a) are guaranteed. from the\ntime that criminal proceed.ings are initiated\n(by complaint, information, or indictmenr)\nand cease to be available if all charges are\ndismissed either voluntarily or on the merits\n(or if the Government declines to bring formal\ncharges after the filing of a complaint).',\nThe Availability of Crime Victims, Rights\nUnder the Crime Victims' Rights Act of 2004,\nMemorandum from John E. Bies (Dec. 12,\n2010, publicly released May 20,2011) (hereinafter\n\"OLC Opinion\"). Indeed, in that same\nopinion, I am surprised to see the Depart_\nment citing a snippet from my floor remarks\nduring the passage of the CVRA for the prop_\nosition that crime victims can confer with\nprosecutors only after the formal filing of\ncharges. See id. at 9 (citing 1b0 Cong. Rec.\n54260, 54268 (Apr. 22,2004) (statement of Sen.\nKyl).\nI did want to express my surprise that your\nprosecutors are so clearly quoting my re_\nmarks out of context. Here is the full pas_\nsage of my remarks, which were part of a\ncolloquy with my co-sponsor on the CVRA.\nSenator Feinstein:\nSenator Feinstein: Section . . . (a)(b) pro_\nvides a right to confer with the attorney for\nthe Government in the case. This right is in_\ntended to be erpansiue. For example, the vic_\ntim has the right to confer with the Govern_\nment concerning any critical stage or dis_\nposition of the case. The right, howeuer. is not\nlimited to these eramples. I ask the Senator if\nhe concurs in this intent.\nSenator Kyl: Yes. The intent of this sec_\ntion is just as the Senator says. This risht to\nconfer does not give the crime victim any\nCONGRESSIONAL RECORD SENATE June 8,2011\nright to\n-\ndirect the prosecution. Prosecutors right to fair treatment and their right to\nshould consider it part of their profession to confer with prosecutors when the Justice Debe\navailable to consult with crime victims partment is negotiating pre-indictment plea\nabout concerns the victims may have which agreements and non-prosecution agreements\nare pertinent to the case, case proceedings or with defense attorneys, including negotiadispositions.\nUnder this provision, uictims are tions within the Fifth Circuit?\nable to confer with the Gouernment's attorneA\nabout proceedings after charging.\n150 Cong. Rec. 54260, 54268 (Apr. 22, 2004)\n(statements of Sens. Feinstein & Kyl) (emphases\nadded). Read in context, it is obvious\nthat the main point of my remarks was that\na victim's right to confer was \"intended to\nbe expansive.\" Senator Feinstein and I then\ngave various examples of situations in which\nvictims could confer with prosecutors, with\nthe note that the right to confer was \"not\nlimited to these examples.\" It is therefore\ntroubling to me that in this opinion the Justice\nDepartment is quoting only a limited\nportion of my remarks and wrenching them\nout of context to suggest that I think that\ncrime victims do not have any right to confer\n(or to be treated with fairness) until after\ncharging.\nIn giving an example that the victims\nwould have such rights after charging, I was\nnot suggesting that they had no such right\nearlier in the process. Elsewhere in my remarks\nI made clear that crime victims had\nrights under the CVRA even before an ind.ictment\nis filed. F or example, in the passage\nquoted above, I made clear that crime victims\nhad a right to consult about both ,,the\ncase\" and \"case proceedingg',-i.g., both\nabout how the case was being handled before\nbeing filed in court and. then later how the\ncase was being handled in court ,,proceedings.\"\nAs another example, Senator\nFeinstein and I explained that we had drafted\nthe CVRA to extend a right to victims to\nattend only \"public\" proceedings, because\notherwise the rights would extend. to grand\njury proceedings. See, e.g., lbO Cong. Rec.\n54260, 54268 (Apr. 22, 2004) (statements of\nSens. Feinstein & Kyt). Of course. no such\nlimitation would have been necessary under\nthe CVRA if CVRA rights attach (as the Department\nseems to think) only after the filing\nof a grand jury indictment.\nCourts have already rejected the Justice\nDepartment's position that the CVRA applies\nonly after an indictment is filed.. For\nexample, in In re Dean, b2T F.gd 891 (bth Cir.\n2008), the Department took the position that\ncrime victims had no right to confer with\nprosecutors until after the Department had\nreached and signed a plea agreement with a\ncorporation (BP Products North America)\nwhose illegal actions had resulted in the\ndeaths of fifteen workers in an oil refinery\nexplosion. Of course, this position meant\nthat the victims could. have no role in shaping\nany plea deal that the Department\nreached. In rejecting the Department's position,\nthe Fifth Circuit held that ,,the govern_\nment should have fashioned a reasonable\nway to inform the victims of the likelihood\nof criminal charges and to ascertain the victims'\nviews on the possible details of a plea\nbargain.\" Id. at 394.\nIn spite of this binding d.ecision from the\nFifth Circuit, crime victims' ad.vocates have\nreported to me that the Justice Department\nis still proceeding in the Fifth Ciicuit and\nelsewhere on the assumption that it has no\nobligations to treat victims fairly or to con_\nfer with them until after charges are for_\nmally filed. Given the Fifth Circuit,s Dean\ndecision, this position appears to place the\nDepartment in violation of a binding court\nruling that extend.s rights to thousand.s of\ncrime victims in Louisiana, Mississippi, and\nTexas. And more generally, the bepart_\nment's position simply has no grounding in\nthe clear language of the CVRA.\nMy first question: What is the Justice De_\npartment doing to extend to victims their\nSRIME VI6TIMS, RIGIIT To AppETTLATE\npRorEcrroN\nProtection of crime victims' rights in appellate\ncourts is an important part of the\nCVRA. As you know, when Congress passed\nthe CVRA, the federal courts of appeals had\nrecognized that crime victims could take ordinary\nappeals to protect their rights. See,\ne.g., Doe u. United States, 666 F.2d 43, 46 (4th\nCir. 1981) (rape victim allowed to appeal district\ncourt's adverse \"rape shield statute\"\nruling); United States v. Kones,77 F.3d 66 (3rd\nCir. 1996) (victim allowed to appeal adverse\nrestitution decision). Congress sought to\nleave these protections in place, while expanding\nthem to ensure that crime victims\ncould obtain quick vindication of their\nrights in appellate courts by providing-in\n$3771(d)(3)-that \"[i]f the district court denies\nthe relief sought, the [victim] may petition\nthe court of appeals for a writ of mandamus.\"\n18 U.S.C. S3771(d)(3). Ordinarily,\nwhether mandamus relief should issue is d.iscretionary.\nThe plain language of the CVRA,\nhowever, specifically and clearly overruled.\nsuch discretionary mandamus standard.s by\ndirecting that \"[t]he court of appeals shall\ntake up and decide such application forthwith\n. . . .\" 18 U.S.C. S3771(d)(3) (emphasis added).\nAs I explained when the Senate considered\nthe CVRA:\n[W]hile mandamus is generally discretionary,\nthis provision [18 U.S.C. gB??1(d)(g)]\nmeans that courts must review these cases.\nAppeilate review of denials of victims' rights\nis just as important as the initial assertion\nof a victim's right. This provision ensures review\nand encourages courts to broadlg d.efend.\nthe victims' rights.\n150 CoNG. REc. 54270 (Apr. 22, 2004) (statement\nof Sen. Kyl) (emphases added). Simi-\nIarly, the CVRA's co-sponsor with me, Senator\nFeinstein, stated that the Act would\ncreate \"a new use of a very old procedure,\nthe writ of mandamus. This provision will\nestablish a procedure where a crime victim\ncan, in essence, immediately appeal a d.enial\nof their rights by a trial court to the court\nof appeals.\" 150 CoNG. REc. 54262 (statement\nof Sen. Feinstein) (emphases added); see also\nid. (statement of Sen. Kyl) (crime victims\nmust \"be able to have the appellate\ncourts take the appeal and order relief). In\nshort, the legislative history shows that\n$ 3771(d)(3) was intended to allow crime victims\nto take accelerated appeats from dis_\ntrict court decisions denying their rights and\nhave their appeals reviewed. under ord.inary\nstandards of appellate review.\nIn spite of that unequivocal legislative history,\nthe Justice Department has in past\ncases asserted a contrary position. In In re\nAntrobus, 519 F.3d 1123 (10th Cir. 200g). Ken\nand Sue Antrobus sought to obtain appellate\nreview of a ruling by a trial court that they\ncould not deliver a victim impact statement\nat the sentencing of the man who sold the\nmurder weapon used to kill their daug:hter.\nThe Tenth Circuit ruled against them on the\nbasis that the Antrobuses were not entiiled\nto regular appellate review, but only discre_\ntionary mandamus review. See id. at Il24_25.\nThe Tenth Circuit did not consider the legis_\nlative history in reaching this conclusion,\nleading the Antrobuses to file petitions for\nrehearing and rehearing en banc-petitions\nthat recounted this legislative history. In re_\nsponse, the Justice Department asked the\nTenth Circuit to deny the victims' petitions.\nRemarkably, the Justice Department told\nthe Tenth Circuit that it could ignore the\nCase 9:08-cv-80736-KAM Document 85-1 Entered on FLSD Docket 06/17/2011 Page 4 of 4\nJune 8, 2011\nIegislative history because the CVRA \"is unambiguous.\"\nResponse of the United States,\nIn re Antrobzs, No. 08-4002, at 72 n.7 (10th Cir.\nFeb. 12, 2008).\nAt the time that the Justice Department\nfiled this brief, no Court of Appeals agreed\nwith the Tenth Circuit. At the time, three\nother Circuits had all issued unanimous rulings\nthat crime victims were entitled to regular\nappellate review. See /n re W.R,. Hufl\nAsset Mgmt. Co.,409 F.3d 555, 562 (2d Cir. 2005);\nKenna, u. US. Dist. Ct. for the Cent. Dist. of Ca.,\n435 F.3d 1011, 1017 (9th Cir. 2006): In re Walsh,\n229 Fed.Appx. 58, at 60 (3rd Cir. 2007).\nMy next question for you is, given that the\nJustice Department has an obligation to use\nits \"best efforts,\" 18 U.S.C. $377f(c)(1), to afford\ncrime victims their rights, how coutd\nthe Department argue in Antrobus (and later\ncases) that the CVRA \"unambiguously\" denied\ncrime victims regular appellate protections\nof their rights when three circuits had\nreached the opposite conclusion?\nGOVERNME}TT'S RIGIIT TO ASSERT ERROR\nDENIAL OF VICTIMS' RIGI{TS\nTo further bolster protection of crime victims'\nrights, Congress also included an ad.ditional\nprovision in the CVRA---SBZT1(dX4)-\nallowing the Justice Department to obtain\nreview of crime victims' rights issues in appeals\nfiled by defendants: ,,In any appeal in\na criminal case, the Government may assert\nas error the district court's denial of any\ncrime victim's right in the proceeding to\nwhich the appeal relates.\" 18 U.S.C.\n$3771(d)(4). The intent underlying this provision\nwas to supplement the crime victims'\nappeal provision found in gBTZI(d)(B) by permitting\nthe Department to also help develop\na body of case law expanding crime victims,\nrights in the many defense appeals that are\nfiled. It was not intended to in any way narrow\ncrime victims' rights to seek relief\nunder S3771(dX3). Nor was it intended to bar\ncrime victims from asserting other remedies.\nFor instance, it was not intend.ed. to block\ncrime victims from taking an ordinary appeal\nfrom an adverse decision affecting their\nrights (such as a decision denying restitution)\nunder 28 U.S.C. 51291. Crime victims\nhad been allowed to take such appeals in various\ncircuits even before the passage of the\nCVRA. See, e.9., United States u. Kones. 77\nF.3d 66 (3rd Cir. 1996) (crime victim allowed.\nto appeal restitution ruling); United, States u.\nPerry,360 F.3d 519 (6th Cir. 2004) (crime victims\nallowed to appeal restitution lien\nissue); Doe u. United States,666 F.2d 48.46 (4th\nCir. 1981) (crime victim allowed. to appeal\nrape shield ruling).\nAs I explained at the time the CVRA was\nunder consideration, this provision supplemented\nthose pre-existing d.ecisions by\n\"allow[ing] the Government to assert a victim's\nright on appeal even when it is the de_\nfendant who seeks appeal of his or her con_\nviction. This ensures that victims' rights are\nprotected throughout the criminal justice\nprocess and that they do not fall by the way_\nside during what can often be an extend.ed.\nappeal that the victim is not a party to.\" 1b0\nCoNG. REc. 54270 (Apr.22,2004) (statement of\nSen. Kyl).\nI have heard from crime victims' advocates\nthat the Department has not been actively\nenforcing this provision. Indeed, these ad.vocates\ntell me that they are unaware of even\na single case where the Department has used.\nthis supplemental remedy. My final question:\nIs it true that the Department has\nnever used this provision in even a single\ncase in the more than six years since the\nCVRA was enacted?\nSincerely,\nJoN KyL,\nU.S. Senator.\nCONGRESSIONAL RECORD\n-\nSENATE\nHONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\nSERGEANT VORASACK T. XAYSANA\nMr. BENNET. Mr. President. it is\nwith a heavy heart that I rise today to\nhonor the life and heroic service of\nSGT Vorasack T. Xaysana. Sergeant\nXaysana, assigned to the Headquarters\nand Headquarters Company, 2nd Battalion,\nbased in Fort Hood, TX, died on\nApril 10, 2011. Sergeant Xaysana was\nserving in support of Operation New\nDawn in Kirkuk, Iraq. He was 30 years\nold.\nA native of Westminster, CO, Sergeant\nXaysana enlisted in the Army in\n2005. During over 6 years of service, he\ndistinguished himself through his courage\nand dedication to duty. Sergeant\nXaysana's exemplary service quickly\nwon the recognition of his commanding\nofficers. He earned, among other decorations,\nthe Iraq Campaign Medal, the\nGlobal War on Temorism Service\nMedal, and the Army Good Conduct\nMedal.\nSergeant Xaysana worked on the\nfront lines of battle, serving in the\nmost dangerous areas of Iraq. Mark\nTwain once said, \"The fear of death fol-\nIows from the fear of life. A man who\nlives fully is prepared to die at any\ntime.\" Sergeant Xaysana's service was\nin keeping with this sentiment-by\nselflessly putting country first, he\nlived life to the fullest. He lived with a\nsense of the highest honorable purpose.\nAt substantial personal risk, he\nbraved the chaos of combat zones\nthroughout Iraq. Though his fate on\nthe battlefield was uncertain. he\npushed forward, protecting America's\ncitizens, her safety, and the freedoms\nwe hold dear. For his service and the\nlives he touched, Sergeant Xaysana\nwill forever be remembered as one of\nour country's bravest.\nTo Sergeant Xaysana's parents,\nThong Chanh and Manithip, and to his\nentire family, I cannot imagine the\nsorrow you must be feeling. I hope\nthat, in time, the pain of your loss will\nbe eased by your pride in Vorasack's\nservice and by your knowledge that his\ncountry will never forget him. We are\nhumbled by his service and his sacrifice.\nGRAZING IMPR,OVEMENT ACT\nMr. BARRASSO. Mr. president, I rise\ntoday to submit for the REcoRD an article\nwritten by Karen Budd-Falen and\npublished May 28, 2011, in the Wyoming\nLivestock Journal. The article's tiile is\n\"Leveling the Playing Field: Support\nfor the Grazing Improvement Act of\n2071.\"\nThe title of the article is instructive.\nAnyone living and working in rural\ncommunities knows the playing field is\nnot level. The National Environmental\nPolicy Act has become the preferred\ntool to delay and iitigate grazing permit\nrenewals for American ranchers.\nLivestock grazing on public lands has\na strong tradition in Wyoming and all\nWestern States. Ranchers aie proud\ns3609\nstewards of the land, yet the permitting\nprocess to renew their permits is\nseverely backlogged due to litigation\naimed at eliminating livestock from\npublic land.\nDuring times of high unemployment\nand increasing food prices, we need to\nbe encouraging jobs in rural economies.\nWe need to be fostering an environment\nto raise more high quality, safe,\nAmerican beef and lamb; not litigating\nless.\nThat is why I introduced the Grazing\nImprovement Act of 2011. This legisiation\nwill provide the certainty and stability\npublic grazing permit holders\ndesperately need in order to continue\nsupporting rural jobs, providing\nhealthy food, and maintaining open\nspaces for recreation and wildlife.\nIt is time to help level the playing\nfield for hard working ranching families\nacross the West. Their livelihood\nshould not be held hostage by litigation\nand anti-grazing special interest\ngroups. I thank my colleagues, Senators\nENzr, CRApo, HATOH, HELLER,\nRrscH, and TnuwE, in supporting ranching\nfamilies and this legislation.\nMr. President, I ask unanimous consent\nto have printed in the RpconD the\narticle to which I referred.\nThere being no objection, the material\nwas ordered to be printed in the\nRncoRo. as follows:\n[From the Wyoming Livestock Roundup,\nMay 28, 20111\nLEVELTNG rnp Pr,eyruc Frulo: SuppoRT FoR\nTHE GRAZING IMPRoVEMENT AcT oF 2Ou\n(By Karen Budd-Falen)\nIf jobs and the economy are the number\none concern for America, why are rural communities\nand ranchers under attack by radical\nenvironmental groups and overzealous\nfederal regulators?\nAmerica depends upon the hundreds of\nproducts that livestock provide, yet radical\ngroups and oppressive regulations make it\nalmost impossible for ranchers to stay in\nbusiness. Opposition to these jobs comes in\nthe form of litigation by radical environmental\ngroups to eliminate grazing on public\nlands, radical environmental group pressure\nto force \"voluntary\" gtazing permit buyouts\nfrom \"willing sellers,\" and holding permittees\nhostage to the court deference given\nto regulatory \"experts.\" The playing field is\nnot level and the rancher is on the losing\nside. The Grazing Improvement Act of 2011\nwill level the playing field. I urge your sup_\nport.\nThe Grazing Improvement Act of 2011 does\nthe following:\n1. Term of Grazing Leases and permits.\nBoth BLM and Forest Service term grazing\npermits are for a 10-year term. This bill ex_\ntends that term to 20 years. This extension\ndoes not affect either the BLM's or Forest\nService's ability to make interim management\ndecisions based upon resource or other\nneeds, nor does it impact the preference\nright of renewal for term grazing permits or\nleases.\n2. Renewal, Transfer and. Reissuance of\nGrazing Leases and Permits. This section\ncodifies the various ,,appropriation riders\"\nfor the BLM and Forest Service requiring\nthat permits being reissued, renewed or\ntransferred continue to follow the existing\nterms and conditions until the paperwork is\ncomplete. Thus, the rancher is not held hos_\ntage to the ability of the agency to get its\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

Information technology was breeding massive,\nrapidly moving social waves. These movements went from invisible to irresistible in\ninstants. They pressed for political change or for economic justice or even for - and\nthis was odd for such wired up efforts, but anyhow - a return to a pre-technological\nage. In most of these countries, the older organizations had little appeal to anew\ngeneration of protesters. The political parties smelled of rot. The media was state-\nowned or controlled by billionaires. For a generation used to instant empowerment,\nthe time to work inside these broken structures seemed impossibly long. And,\nanyhow, another option existed. Twitter or Facebook or YouTube had taught them.\nSo riots in those dozens of cities, unplanned and uncontrolled, emerged.** The\n“Collective Action,” of popular movements for hundreds of years from Bastille-\nraiders to labor actions, was replaced - upgraded? - into “Connective Action.”\nPeople who'd never met and who shared very different histories and desires, were\nconnected, fused together by lightspeed bits in hope or fury or vengeful rage.®> This\nwas, perhaps, predictable. It mirrored the linked, fast-spreading dynamism of the\n2008 crisis itself.

I had greatly respected Stone ability as a film\ndirector after watching him work in Wall Street IT: Money Never Sleeps, a film in which I had a\ncameo role. I also had debated Stone about the historic accuracy of his 1990 movie JFK at Town\nHall in New York.\n\nWhen we dined, he had just written, produced, written and directed “Snowden,” an\nindependently-financed film depicting Snowden, as put, as “one of the great heroes of the 21*\ncentury.” In preparing for it, he had not only seen Snowden in 2013 and 2014, but he had had a\nsix-hour meeting with Putin.\n\nThe reason I wanted to talk to him was not to learn about the film but to find about how he\nhad made to gain access to Snowden in Moscow. I already knew from the documents taken\nfrom Sony Pictures Entertainment allegedly by North Korea that Stone had paid the Guardian\n$700,000 for the film rights to “The Snowden File,” a book written by Luke Harding. This was\nnot a surprising sum since it provided a basis for movie which describes Snowden’s coup. But\nthese documents also revealed that Stone had paid Anatoly Kucherena, Snowden’s legal\nrepresentative in Moscow, $1 million dollars, supposedly for the rights to his novel Time of the\nOctopus. Even by Hollywood standards one million dollars was an extraordinary sum to pay for\na yet-to-be published work of Russian fiction, and it was especially striking since Stone was\nmaking a fact-based movie using the actual names of the characters. “Is your script based on\nKucherena’s “Time of the Octopus?” I asked.\n\n“No,” Stone replied, “I haven’t used it.” He said that the payment was for what he termed\n“total access.” He explained that Barbara Broccoli and Michael G.

But\n\neven that uncertainly is a surprise in view of what we all were taught.\n\nDepreciation theory is one of my favorites. It doesn’t upset the applecart as much as\nthe pay rule does, because little economic theory depends on it. I love it because it\nreverses tradition precisely. National accounts model depreciation as declining\nexponentially. | model it as rising exponentially. It’s the same equation with a plus\nsign in place of a minus sign. | love its obviousness once we think about it. It follows\nwhen we remember the present value rule. Once we do, evidence for both factors\nmakes more sense. Depreciation theory rounds out the pay rule in explaining how\npay can rise or hold steady to the very end. And we see the same in businesses.\nGross realized profit, analogous to pay, does not tend to decline as firms approach a\ndate with the wrecking ball. My impression has been that rents go down when\nproperties aren't kept up or locations become unfashionable, but not with age in\nitself. When it’s time to demolish and rebuild, premises are more typically vacated\nwith trade still running at norms. Gross realized profit is inevitably all depreciation\n\non the last day, and would approach zero steadily if tradition were right.\n\nThere may have been minor novelty in my derivation of my three fundamental\ntheorems as at least subjective certitudes following from definitions, and in my idea\nitself of subjective as distinct from empirical certitude.

The U.S. \nJustice Department has sued to block that deal. \nIn a report on Cohen's company, Avenatti's law firm said that Novartis in late 2017 and early \n2018 made four separate payments to Essential Consultants totaling nearly $400,000. \n\"Following these payments, reports surfaced that Mr. Trump took a dinner with the \nincoming CEO of Novartis before Mr. Trump's speech at the World Economic Forum in \nDavos, Switzerland in late January 2018,\" Avenatti's report said. \nThat CEO, Vas Narasimhan, was joined with a group of other companies' executives at that  \ndinner.  \nA Novartis spokesperson said in a statement that \"any agreements with Essential Consultants \nwere entered before our current CEO taking office in February of this year and have \nexpired. \nAvenatti's report says another company, Korea Aerospace Industries LTD, paid Essential \nConsultants $150,000 in November 2017. \nAvenatti's client Daniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford, was paid $130,000 by \nEssential Consultants on the eve of the 2016 presidential election. \nDaniels says the money was in exchange for her signing a deal that required her to remain \nsilent about an affair she claims to have had with Trump in 2006, shortly after the birth of \nhis youngest son. \nThe White House has denied that Trump had sex with the adult film actress. \nNeither the White House nor Cohen had an immediate comment on Avenatti's new \nallegations about payments to Cohen's company. \nII \nWATCH: Feds saw log of Cohen's phone calls \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 016219 \nRichard Kahn \nHBRK Associates Inc. \n575 Lexington Avenue, 4th Floor \nNew York, NY 10022 \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 016220 \n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

But perhaps they are less disturbing then we might imagine. not so bad if the\ntake home message is that we are closet racists with antiquated theories of evolution or God’s design.\nOutside of these artificial studies, we are well educated citizens who keep our isms tucked away, locked\nup in our unconscious. Unfortunately, the unsettling feelings that many will have to these studies are\nexacerbated by an additional set of results collected by Eberhardt, linking unconscious impressions to\nharmful actions. Caucasian male subjects watched a video of a policeman using force to subdue a suspect\nwho was either Black or Caucasian. When primed with an ape drawing, but not that of a tiger, subjects\nwere more likely to say that the policeman was justified in subduing the Black suspect than the Caucasian\nsuspect. We are more than closet racists. We are out of the closet, armed for prejudice and\ndehumanization.\n\nTo unconsciously think that Blacks are more like apes than other racial groups is to strip them of\ncharacteristics that are uniquely human. As Haslam notes, when we dehumanize others in this particular\nway, we no longer see them as human, but as incompetent wild animals or immature children lacking in\nintelligence, etiquette, rationality, and moral wherewithal. This mode of dehumanization is ancient,\nreflected in the writings and paintings of European explorers who encountered indigenous cultures in\nAsia, Australia, and Africa. Dehumanizing others into objects is equally ancient, unflattering and\ndangerous. In one study, American adults were told to focus on either the physical appearance or\npersonality of the actress Angelina Jolie and the ex-governor of Alaska and presidential hopeful Sarah\nPalin — both famous personalities within the United States. When subjects focused on appearance as\nopposed to personality, they judged both Jolie and Palin as relatively lacking in traits of experience or\nhuman nature. Jolie and Palin were seen as objects. In other studies, carried out by Haslam, subjects\njudged objectified men and women as less capable of suffering and less deserving of moral compassion\nand protection, reinforcing the age old attitude we once held toward slaves, and that many hold today\ntoward prostitutes. When people become property, they fall outside of the circle of moral patients. Studies\nof the brain provide further support for these dehumanizing transformations, and highlight, once again,\n\nboth the beneficial and malignant consequences of our mind’s promiscuity.\n\nBrains without borders\n\nDehumanization enables doctors to treat their patients — human or nonhuman animal — as mechanical\n\nHauser Chapter 3.

Oi] prices are shooting over one hundred dollars a barrel. The US government is on the\nverge of a shut down. These are not the top secret opening lines to Aaron Sorkin’s new script, but the\nglobal headlines of a world spinning out of control. I head to Los Angeles like an overdressed lemming to\nattend the 83rd Academy Awards and attempt to make sense of artists thrust into combat.\n\nFor the second year nearly 6,000 Academy members have nominated 10 films and the battle is down to two.\nThe beloved timeless classic, \"The King's Speech\" marches into the arena as the front runner, but\npassionate supporters of the brilliant edgier (and critics darling) \"The Social Network\" have not\nconceded. The ballots are counted, the party invites are out and still the feelings are raw. Filmmakers\nare exhausted from campaigning.\n\nAt Bryan Lourd's famous star studded party Sony Classics’ Co-President Michael Barker announces to me he\nhas taken a random sampling of voters in the room. He says, \"There will be a ‘Social Network’ upset at\nthe Kodak Theater.\" Shear panic radiates from my every pore as he says, \"I am joking.\" It's like color\nwar at summer camp.\n\nwoody Allen and George Lucas tell me they are no longer members of the Academy because pitting artists\nagainst each other to determine the quality of their work is insane. They are right.\n\nMy event and publicity company is considered \"Switzerland\" by the studios, as we help every filmmaker to\npresent and position his work. This year I am somewhat emotionally sucked in.\n\nIn 2005 I meet the unknown 32-year-old English director Tom Hooper on his first film for HBO,\"Elizabeth\nI\". The Emmy award winning movie stars Helen Mirren, who takes credit for discovering him directing\nEnglish television. Helen later wins her Oscar for portraying Queen Elizabeth in “The Queen”. Queen\nElizabeth is the daughter of King George VI portrayed by Oscar winner Colin Firth in “The King's Speech\".\n\nI also become Hooper's champion encouraging many to see his early work including his herculean 10 hour\nHBO mini-series \"John Adams\" produced by Tom Hanks.\n\nSix years later at the Telluride Film Festival Tom Hooper is bathing in the glory of a hysterical\nstanding ovation with Colin Firth and Geoffrey Rush at the very first screening of \"The King's Speech.”\nSurprisingly, this drama's subtle humor gets big laughs leading up to its emotional ending.\n\nwithin two weeks, at The Toronto Film Festival, Harvey Weinstein is now standing with his filmmakers\nwitnessing the same reaction. The film wins The Audience Prize. Their strategy is to say nothing. Do\nnothing. They have a possible Oscar winner. Four out of five past Best Pictures have premiered in\nToronto.\n\ncut to New York City at the end of September. It's the opening night at The Film Society of Lincoln\ncenter. One of America’s most important and prolific producers Scott Rudin, along with Jesse Eisenberg,\nAndrew Garfield and Aaron Sorkin are in a brightly lit box waving down to their equally hysterical\naudience who have just seen \"The Social Network\".\n\nThe film opens the next day to rave reviews and endless publicity. David Fincher is off making “The Girl\nwith the Dragon Tattoo\". Aaron Sorkin becomes the face of the film and an immediate shoo-in for an Oscar.\n\nThe Hamptons International Film Festival in October suddenly becomes a launching pad for \"127 Hours\",\nwhere cool Yale/NYU student James Franco appears and receives a heroic standing ovation. More Oscar buzz.\n\n“Black Swan\" also unspools there in a tiny theater as Madonna, Alec Baldwin and even Harvey Weinstein\n\nslip in the back. Darren Aronofsky, sporting the ever present cool wool scarf around his neck is hailed a\ngenius.

We must be\nwilling to act. It’s easy to be sympathetic to the desire for less action. Nothing we’ve\ndone in recent years seems to be working. But, as we'll see, that’s because we've\nbeen using the wrong tools. Our enemies? They are developing the right ones. They\nare willing, and eager, to act. To travel the world now is to encounter in nearly every\ncapital figures who have a different reading of history or the future of the global\norder. They see the world not as some ready-to-eat American political order but\nrather as a churning, uncertain, urgently worrying vortex. They wonder: What might\nwe build? They look at America’s global leadership with the hungry eyes of an\nInternet startup eyeing an old, unconnected market. “Don’t do stupid things,” is an\ninvitation for these forces to poke at the world, to take risks, and to remind us that\nso much of what later seems brilliant appears stupid or insane when it begins.\n\nIn the years since “smart power” became fashionable, another proposition has\nemerged from a different group of elite thinkers. It is, in a sense, the flipside of that\nstrategy-free posture of passivity. It was distilled by a well-regarded cluster of\nacademic foreign policy specialists in 2012 as America began withdrawing from\nIraq: “Don’t Come Home America!” they called their essay. As they explained, “The\nUnited States’ globe-girding grand strategy is the devil we know. A world with a\ndisengaged United States is the devil we don’t know.”®? According to this logic, the\ncountry’s globe-striding posture, while expensive and exhausting and admittedly\ninefficient, is a crucial element of our rich national power. Yes, we spend 15% of our\nGDP on security activities, but we reap far more in return: Access to the best minds\nin the world, a secure life, a culture of open debate and personal liberty.\n\nThe problem here is that “Don’t Go Home!” feels, for the most part, like a costly\ngroping after something to hold onto. Articles and speeches and policy ideas that\nflow from this hopeful camp have a shimmering and expensive unreality, one that\nAmerican domestic sentiment would be unlikely to support for long and that jostles\nagainst our experience of recent years. Are more aircraft carriers, overseas bases\nand jet fighters really the cure for the dangers we face? The ideas of this group have\nan appealing simplicity, or maybe I should say an appealing familiarity, because they\necho instincts about power that were once true. The energetic engagement with the\nworld they suggest is attractive, but America has work to do at home and - we can\nall see - the ambitious overseas tasks of recent decades have not, in any event, been\nreally finished. Instead of a confident, conclusive, “Job well done!” comfort we still\nsweat with nervousness. What is coming next? After all the blood and treasure, after\n850,000 soldiers in Afghanistan and $3 trillion dollars - we were left with expanded\nswamps. Like “Don't do stupid things”, “Don’t Go Home!” tells us little about the\npicture of world order that might emerge in the future.

Second, students could choose to think\nabout diagnosis in some areas as opposed to others. Art experts might\nteach about art fraud, and lawyers might teach about detecting busi-\nness fraud. In each case there would be similarities, and these should\nbe taught by a group of faculty from different areas, but at the end\nof the course students should be able to start to actually do diagnosis\nunder the tutelage of an expert in an area that interests them.\n\nThey actually may not know much about that area of knowledge,\nof course, and that would be the objection of the faculty to this idea.\nBut it is my contention that faculty have had this wrong all these\nyears. Teaching the basics to students, who have no concept of their\npossible use, is really not helpful. All these introductory courses are\njust an excuse to pack kids into lecture halls and pretend to do educa-\ntion while saving money on hiring more teachers.

One can try one’s hand at\ncrime detection, without knowing everything about the details of\nhow one does it, with the help of an expert looking over one’s shoul-\nder. This kind of just-in-time learning is how humans have always\nlearned what they needed to know. The idea that school should teach\nyou what you need to know before you need to know it, is seriously\nflawed.

All of these\npeople could be teaching a course together on how to make judgments\nfairly and how to determine what is fair.

While he’d never lost the formal bearing — or the\naccent — from his childhood in Poland, his long years in Israel’s political\nwilderness mirrored the wider exclusion felt by the Sephardim. The last election\nhe had lost, in December 1973, proved too soon for the earth to part. But he told\nhis supporters: “Even though Labour has won these elections, after something\nlike the Yom Kippur War happens to a country, and to a government, they must\nlose power. They wi// lose power.” He was right. Only twice in the four decades\nthat followed would a Labor leader defeat Begin’s Likud party: Rabin’s election\nvictory in 1992, and mine over Bibi Netanyahu in 1999.\n\nDuring the first two years of Begin’s rule, however, I was 7,000 miles away.\nTen days before the election, I’d gone to see Motta, and he’d agreed that I could\nreturn to Stanford, to finish what I’d barely begun when the 1973 war broke out.\nI had been in the army, with the one hiatus as a sayeret reservist at Hebrew\nUniversity, since the age of seventeen. I did not regret committing myself to a\nlife in uniform. But Stanford offered an extraordinary opportunity to broaden\nmy horizons. Even in the few weeks I’d spent there before the war, I'd felt\nreinvigorated. It engaged a different kind of intelligence, a different part of who\nI was: the books, the professors. A chance to listen to, and at least try to play,\nbeautiful music. And to spend more than a few stolen evenings or weekends\nwith my family.\n\nThe timing had nothing to do with the election. Like most other Labor\nIsraelis, and many of Begin’s own supporters, I hadn’t expected the Likud to\nwin. It was because I felt I'd reached a natural punctuation mark in my military\ncareer. I’d led Sayeret Matkal. I’d commanded a tank company, a battalion in\n1973, and, more briefly than I’d hoped, the 401° Brigade after the war. I’d spent\nthe last two years in the kirva. The next step up the command chain would be to\nlead a full armored division. But at age 35, I was probably too young, and I\nfigured I’d have a far better chance in two years’ time. I also feared losing the\nchance to go to Stanford altogether. Motta’s term as chief of staff would end the\nfollowing year. Among those in the frame to succeed him was Raful Eitan.\nRecalling Raful’s dismissive, almost sneering, opposition to my making the\nSayeret Matkal into Israel’s SAS, I wasn’t exactly confident I could count on\nhis support.\n\n181\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_011652\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

He had spent\nyears studying Chinese medicine (and\nmedical history), and this made no sense\nto him. “I thought, Ted, step back a\nminute. This wasn’t just something that\nwas a negative. It was something that\nneeded to be understood.”\n\nSlowly, over the past decade, re-\nsearchers have begun to tease out the\nstrands of the placebo response. The\nfindings, while difficult to translate into\nmedicine, have been compelling. In most\ncases, the larger the pill, the stronger the\nplacebo effect. Two pills are better than\none, and brand-name pills trump gener-\nics. Capsules are generally more effective\nthan pills, and injections produce a more\npronounced effect than either. There is\neven evidence to suggest that the color of\nmedicine influences the way one re-\nsponds to it: colored pills are more likely\nto relieve pain than white pills; blue pills\nhelp people sleep better than red pills;\nand green capsules are the best bet when\nit comes to anxiety medication.\n\nConditioning and expectations mat-\nter, and so does learned behavior. In the\neighties, Levine and Gordon divided a\ngroup of postoperative patients into three\nsections: those in the first section re-\nceived morphine secretly, those in the\nsecond were told they would receive\nmorphine (and did), and those in the\nthird were given a placebo that was de-\nscribed as a powerful pain reliever. The\nresults were startling. Patients who were\ntold that they would receive a painkiller,\nwhether they actually received it or not,\nhad the same experience in the trial as\nthose who secretly received between six\nand eight milligrams of morphine—a\nsignificant amount. The covert dose had\nto be increased to twelve milligrams to\nsurpass the effect of the placebo. Over\nthe past two decades, the Italian neuro-\nscientist Fabrizio Benedetti (who studied\nwith Gordon and Levine), and Luana\nColloca, a colleague of Benedetti’s, who\nis now based in the United States, at\nthe National Institutes of Health, have\nexpanded on these studies. They have\n\nfound, for example, that diazepam—\nmore commonly known as Valium—has\nno discernible effect on anxiety unless a\nperson knows he is taking it. And, in-\ncreasingly, studies like those have been\ncarried out with the help of imaging\ntechniques—such as PET scans and func-\ntional M.R.I.s—that can track brain\nchanges as they happen. These advances\nin brain imaging, along with an increased\nunderstanding of neurochemicals, have\ntransformed a vague and mysterious no-\ntion into a tangible effect that scientists\nconsider worthy of investigation.\n\n“What's exciting here is that, ifwe are\nto talk about using placebos in a clinical\nsetting, they would have to have a mea-\nsurable effect and a biology we under-\nstand,” Wayne Jonas told me. Jonas is an\ninteresting hybrid in a world often\nsharply divided between conventional\nand alternative therapies. In the early\nnineties, he served as the director of the\nMedical Research Fellowship Program\nat the Walter Reed Army Institute of\nResearch, in Washington, D.C. He went\non to run the Office of Alternative Med-\nicine at the National Institutes of Health,\nfrom 1995 to 1999. Today, Jonas is the\npresident of the Samueli Institute, a\nWashington research group devoted to\nshifting the focus of health care from\ntreatment to prevention.\n\n“The morphine studies bring us a long\nway,” he said. So did a recent investiga-\ntion by Kaptchuk, in which participants\n\nsuffering from irritable-bowel syndrome\nwere not deceived about their treatment;\nin fact, they were told in great detail about\nthe placebos they received and that they\nwere often as effective as real medicine.\nThe pills brought them relief.\n\nFor many people in the field, results\nlike those achieved in the morphine and\nI.B.S. studies, while preliminary and in\nneed of confirmation, hint at something\nfar more significant than the effect of a\nplacebo or problems with a particular\ndrug. They suggest that the “magic bullet”\napproach to health care—simple, effective\nsolutions to single problems, like a strep\ninfection or polio—can no longer remain\nour principal approach to treating disease.\n\nThere has always been a distinction\nbetween disease and illness. Disease is a\nbiological condition that we have histor-\nically treated with drugs, surgery, and\nother technological solutions. Illness, on\nthe other hand, defines the context of a\nmedical encounter, including the rela-\ntionship between doctor and patient.\nLike Kaptchuk, Jonas believes that pla-\ncebo research demonstrates that it is es-\nsential to consider both the science and\nthe art of medicine—to think about dis-\neases as illnesses, and not to rely solely on\nshort-term, high-tech solutions. Scien-\ntists hope that, even if it proves impossi-\nble to replace drugs with placebos, re-\nsearch into the way they affect us will\naccomplish nothing less than a transfor-\nmation of American medicine. “There are\n\n“Bore me to sleep, Daddy.”\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_029928\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

I had no trouble understanding the reasons\nmany Israeli Arabs were abandoning me. The clashes in the Galilee at the start of\nthe new intifada had left more than a dozen of their community dead. As an official\ninquiry would later conclude, there was blame on all sides. A number of Arab\nmembers of the Knesset had played a part in inciting the violence. Yet the police\nhad been unprepared, and they had used excessive force. As I said publicly before\nthe election, I, as Prime Minister, was ultimately responsible, and I formally\napologized for what had happened. Yet the roots went deeper, to the economic and\nsocial disadvantages still faced by many Arab citizens, and the difficulty in\nresolving those problems calmly and collectively as long as Israel remained in a\nstate of war with its Arab neighbors.\n\nFor Labor and the political left, it was as if, despite Arafat’s repeated rejections\nof ever more forthcoming terms of peace, they still couldn’t bring themselves to\nbelieve he really meant it. By default, they were inclined to blame me for not\ndelivering peace. I was accused of relying too much on a close circle of aides and\nnegotiators I’d known from my time in the army, of not giving a negotiating role to\nLabor veterans of the Oslo negotiations like Yossi Beilin, and of being\ninsufficiently sensitive to Arafat’s needs in the negotiating process. Typical of the\nargument was a broadside by the journalist and historian Tom Segev, in Haaretz,\nwhich accused me of an “incredible arrogance” which had “led to an historic\nmistake. Rather than continue on the Oslo road, Barak put it into his head that he\ncould reach a final settlement and try and impose it on the Palestinian Authority\nPresident.” I did not try to “impose” anything on Arafat. I did, quite consciously,\nabandon the “Oslo road” because it was inexorably leading to a situation where,\nafter the final Wye redeployments, Arafat would have control over the great\nmajority of the West Bank without having to commit to any of the assurances that\neven most on the Israeli left would define as the minimum required for peace.\nNow, of course, we knew that was something the Palestinian leader was not\nprepared to do.\n\nWhen election day came, not that many of my critics on the left actually voted\nagainst me. Nor did the Israeli Arabs. Yet in very large numbers, they simply\ndidn’t vote. In percentage terms, Arik’s victory was even more decisive than mine\nover Bibi. He got more than 62 percent of the vote.

That flight records show Clinton was flown on \nnumerous occasions to the island on Epstein's private jet. Clinton had a close relationship with an employee of \nEpstein's who compiled thousands of photos of nude young girls posed in lewd positions. And these photos \nwere used as a catalog for Epstein to loan out his girls to powerful politicians and British royalty, including Bill \nClinton. \nAccording to the lawsuit:  \nAdvertisement-content continues below \n...Clinton was friends with an unnamed woman who \"kept images of naked underage children on her computer, \nhelped to recruit underage children for Epstein... and photographed underage females in sexually explicit \nposes.\" \nWhile Epstein was indicted and jailed for his pedophilia, Bill Clinton oddly has remained unscathed, more than \nlikely by having friends in high places. \nIf Bill Clinton is in fact a pedophile, will the American people demand that he be put away for a very long time \nso that he can't hurt any more children? Or will having friends in high places exempt him from the rule of law? \nTime will tell. \nTop of Form \nBottom of Form \nShare \nAds by Adblade  \nOffers and Articles \nVPIL-\nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 022624 \nRevolting Facts About Fast Food Burgers.

L. Rev. 844, *864\n\nPublic prosecutors now dominate enforcement decisions in both common law-based and civil law-based justice systems\nworldwide. That is hardly surprising, given the far-reaching regulatory scope of modern criminal law and high expectations that\nthe state will ensure security against social disorder and innumerable harms, and will intervene in risk creation long before\nmanifest criminal conduct or injury. © That agenda requires capacity, resources, and expertise that only public agencies can\nmarshal. Moreover, a criminal enforcement regime that relied heavily on private plaintiffs would be one skewed against redress\nfor poor victims who cannot bear litigation costs to vindicate their own interests. 7° Without safeguards, such a regime [*865]\nalso could be at the mercy of the varied, perhaps idiosyncratic motives and interests of private actors lodging criminal\ncomplaints.\n\nStill, many countries continue to authorize private citizens to initiate criminal prosecutions when public officials do not, and\nothers allow privately funded attorneys to assist or supplement public prosecutors in litigating criminal cases. Canada,\nAustralia, New Zealand, and England and Wales all continue to allow private prosecutions, 7! and fifteen of the twenty-eight\nmember states of the European Union grant victims some comparable [*866] authority. ’* Details vary across jurisdictions,\nbut everywhere private prosecutors’ authority is limited by oversight from public [*867] prosecutors and courts. ™ The\nstandard common law model is that public prosecutors retain the power to take over privately filed charges and then either try\nthe case themselves, negotiate a plea bargain, or - more commonly when intervention occurs - dismiss the charges altogether.\nIn this framework, private actors can press charges when public officials do not, but functionally they serve primarily as a\nmechanism for political accountability. Through private charging in the wake of public prosecutors’ declination, victims force\npublic officials to justify publicly their reasons for not charging and for vetoing privately filed charges - and to do so on\ngrounds other than public resource constraints, given that a private actor has offered to bear the costs. Given the private cost\nbarriers and the capacity of public prosecution agencies, it is unsurprising that, even where permitted, privately initiated\n\ncharges nonetheless contribute to a tiny fraction of prosecutions on criminal dockets. “4\n\n2.

To try to know what others are doing is a fundamental part of being human. So is fitting\nin. The more collectivist the human society, the more important it is to conform and the more\nprominent the role of shame.* Shame serves as a warning to adhere to group standards or be\nprepared for peer punishment. Many individualistic societies, however, have migrated away from\npeer punishment toward a third-party penal system, such as a hired police force, formal\ncontracts, or trial by jury. Shame has become less relevant in societies where taking the law into\none’s own hands is viewed as a breach of civility.\n\nPerhaps this is why it makes us uncomfortable to contemplate shaming people: Shame\ninvites the public in on the punishment. Consider the scaffolds, scab lists during union strikes, or\nNathaniel Hawthorne’s The Scarlet Letter. Or the proposal made by prominent conservative\nWilliam F. Buckley Jr. in 1986 to tattoo people with AIDS. These instances of shaming now\nseem an affront to individual liberty. Getting rid of shaming seems like a pretty good thing,\nespecially in regulating individual behavior that does not harm others. In eschewing public\nshaming, society has begun to rely more heavily on individual feelings of guilt to enhance\ncooperation.\n\nGuilt prevails in many social dilemmas, including one area of my own research:\noverfishing. At the root of the problem of overfishing is the human appetite. Wild fish catches\n\nare declining, and many of us seek to avoid the guilt brought on by eating unsustainable seafood.\n\n3M.

What do you do, sir?” However, if policies\nbased on conviction or consistency over time are signals that a candidate does not look\nat the benefits of cooperation, this is an indication that the candidate can be trusted in\nsituations where making the decision that is right for his or her constituency comes at\na large political cost. Consistent with this, opponents take every opportunity to paint\ncandidates as flip-floppers who cannot be trusted [21]. This argument generalizes outside\nof politics to why we respect people who are “principled” over those who are “strategic”.\n\nPeople intuitively cooperate. That is, when people make decisions rapidly, they are\nmore likely to cooperate than if they have time to deliberate. Additionally, people who\ncooperate make quicker decisions than those who defect [22]. The Social Heuristics Hy-\npothesis offers one explanation for this phenomena: we adopt heuristics to avoid incurring\ncognitive costs associated with deliberation [23, 24, 25]. In a world with repeated inter-\nactions, it is usually worthwhile to cooperate, so individuals may adopt heuristics such\nas “always cooperate” or “cooperate as long a situation is not a business interaction.”\nThese same individuals, when serving as laboratory subjects, may apply these heuristics\nand cooperate even when it is not worthwhile to do so [22, 26].\n\nOur model offers the following alternative explanation for intuitive cooperation. Intu-\nitive cooperation may serve to reduce responsiveness to realized costs. Thus, others should\ntrust intuitive cooperators more than deliberate cooperators. Since intuitive cooperators\nare more trustworthy, this may lead people to evolve or learn to become intuitive cooper-\nators. Note that this explanation suggests that intuitive cooperation may be an optimal\nresponse to others’ ability to detect deliberation, and not, as a heuristic is, an attempt\nto avoid cognitive costs. For this explanation to be sensible, it must be the case that\nwhether or not a decision is made intuitively or deliberatively is detectable. In fact, it is:\n\ndeliberative decision making leads to slower reaction time, as well as increased pupil size\n\n10\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_026530\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

I asked what the jury instruction had\nbeen. A student sheepishly raised his hand and said, “Professor, there was no jury instruction - -\nthe case was tried before a judge.” I said, “Woops - - I made a mistake. You’re right,” and I\nmoved on. I noticed that after that “mistake” the students loosened up and were prepared to take\nmany more risks. I have repeated this ploy many times to loosen up a class.\n\nSometimes my mistakes in class were completely unintentional and darn embarrassing. Once I\nwas teaching about a criminal concept that required the prosecution to build a wall separating\ninformation obtained under grant of immunity from information independently secured through\ninvestigation. The courts described this as a “Chinese Wall” because it had to be impenetrable. I\nwas raising the possibility that one prosecutor may have improperly leaked information to another\nprosecutor, and I described it as follows: “There may have been a chink in the Chinese Wall.” A\nChinese American student in the class immediately took offense, erroneously believing that I was\nreferring to Chinese people with that racial epithet. The thought had never occurred to me, but I\nnever used that particular phraseology again.\n\nI also offended some of my Jewish students once when I was comparing Canada’s approach to\naffirmative action to our own. In Canada, only “visible minorities” are eligible for affirmative\naction. A student asked me whether Jews were a visible minority. I responded, “No, we’re an\naudible minority.” Even though I was joking about my own group, I got flack from a number of\nJewish students who thought I was reaffirming an old stereotype. I quickly learned that humor\nwas important to my teaching but that humor based on racial, gender or religious stereotyping\ncould raise sensitivities.\n\nI was sympathetic, therefore, when I asked a first year student how we would have responded to\na particular plea bargain offer by a prosecutor. His response: “I would have tried to Jew him\ndown a bit.” The class was appalled at his ethnic slur and so was I, but I understood that he was\nprobably just regurgitating what he had heard at his dinner table. I spoke to him privately after\nclass. He was genuinely mortified at his lack of sensitivity. I’m sure he never repeated that\nparticular slur.\n\nBecause I was a rookie, I tended to spend an enormous number of hours preparing for each class.\nI stayed up the night before planning my questions and strategies and got to the law school at\n7:00 am before each class. Naturally I parked in the first available slot in the parking lot. Several\ndays into the semester Professor Clark Byse mentioned at lunch that Dean Griswold was sizzling\nmad because someone was taking his parking spot every day. Nobody had told me that the first\nspot was traditionally reserved for the Dean.\n\nErwin Griswold was quite concerned about my lack of sophistication. I had never been outside\nthe United States when I first started teaching at Harvard. I had barely been out of the Northeast.\nI still spoke with a pretty thick Brooklyn accent and, occasionally, allowed Yiddishisms to creep\ninto my conversation. Griswold decided to take me on as a project. In the spring of my first year,\nhe told me that he wanted me to go to England and France to look into criminology institutes in\nthose two countries. The school would pay for the entire trip and various alumni would meet me\nin Paris and London and show me around. I was thrilled, but a bit surprised, when I got to Paris\nand discovered that there was no criminology institute to speak of. I still had a wonderful time.\n\n72\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_017159\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

Historically, the relational formalisms of\nequilibrium thermodynamics emerged before our knowledge of the internal structure\nof matter. For examples, the pressure in an insulated container of gas is due to\nmolecular bombardment of the container walls, which increases with heat or\ncompression of its volume. Compression of its volume increases its temperature\nand expansion of its volume leads to cooling. Note that these relationships hold\n\nwithout specifying the constituents and the specifics of a particular gas or solid.\n\nIn his lectures, Feynman’s intuitively accessible examples of reversible\nthermodynamic properties are reminiscent of his on camera performance at the\nSenatorial hearings about the Challenger disaster. Recall that he dropped an O-ring\nin a glass of iced water demonstrating cold-induced rigidification of the rubber ring,\nwhich he postulated to be the cause of the fuel leak and resulting explosion. In his\nLectures, he said that if one holds a rubber band between ones lips as a crude\nthermometer, stretching a rubber band heats up the lips and relaxing it cools them.\nWorking the same system in reverse, and equilibrium thermodynamic systems are\nclassically reversible, we find that heating a rubber band makes it contract. These\nchanges involve complicated alterations in the internal arrangements of the\npolymeric strands of rubber, their structural properties, the details of which, for the\npurpose of global thermodynamic characterization, need not be known. The\nrelationships between physical state, energy and temperature in this material were\npredictable from thermodynamic laws even without specific knowledge of the\n\ncomplex internal structure and physical dynamics of rubber.\n\nThermodynamic theory, which makes deep conceptual connections between\nquantitatively measurable primitives such as heat, hotness and work and the\n\ninvisible in the form of derived ideas such as energy and entropy, yielded an\n\n70\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_013570\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

It's equally\nquestionable whether Sex and the City's Carrie Bradshaw, who cheated on her\nkindhearted and generous boyfriend, Aidan, only to end up with the more exciting but\nself-absorbed Mr. Big, will be better off in the framework of marriage and family. (Some\ntime after the breakup, when Carrie ran into Aidan on the street, he was carrying his\ninfant in a Baby Bjorn. Can anyone imagine Mr. Big walking around with a Bjorn?)\n\nI've never watched Friends or Sex and the City, but I know the feeling.\n\nPersonally, I'm more of a novel girl. The other day, I found myself thinking of my long-\nago roommate and her thoughts on arranged marriage while I read Monica Ali's beautiful\nbook Brick Lane. Monica Ali is an immigrant to the United Kingdom, and the characters\nin her novel all come to the UK from Bangladesh. Some of the characters accept\ntraditional arranged marriages, while others make \"love marriages\" instead -- often\ndefying their parents, their whole set of cultural norms, to do so. Towards the end of the\nnovel, one man reflects on the early days of his marriage:\n\nWe thought that the love would never run out. It was like a magic rice sack that you\ncould keep scooping into and never get to the bottom. It was a \"love\" marriage, you See.\nWhat I did not know -- I was a young man -- is that there are two kinds of love. The kind\nthat starts off big and slowly wears away, that seems you can never use it up and then\none day is finished. And the kind that you don't notice at first, but which adds a little bit\nto itself every day, like an oyster makes a pearl, grain by grain, a jewel from the sand.\n\nAs you can tell, this character is currently unhappy in his \"love marriage.” Of course, the\ngrass is always greener on the other side. What's the difference between the big love and\nthe pearl love? Can they even be compared? Is it like apples to oranges?\n\nBut couldn't all this be a false dichotomy? Who says it's about arrangement versus\nrandomness -- chemistry versus choice? Can we have both? Can we find the big love, and\nnurture that so it develops into the pearl love, too?\n\nMy ultimate conclusion about the Art and Science of Flirting, from my \"studies\" of\npickup artists and also my entire life, is that flirting is all about strategic ambiguity.\nDeliberate uncertainty. Manipulating ambiguity and uncertainty can contribute to many\nintense feelings.\n\nSome people learn this, and decide that the only way to have a relationship with\nchemistry is to include a constant generous dollop of uncertainty about love, loyalty, or\nsomething equally important. These people decide chemistry can only derive from little\npieces of confusion: tiny mismatches that lodge underneath the similarities that bring\npeople together, constantly unsettling, like a prickly burr. But I don't think that's what I\nwant.\n\nAnd after all, S&M creates extraordinary feelings too, but plenty of people do S&M in\nvery controlled circumstances: pre-discussed, with safewords and so on. Arguably, S&M\nis another form of mismatch, of contrast, of uncertainty -- but it's a form that can be\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_018623\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

[but] it has been an emotional\nroller coaster since I stepped off the plane.” She diverted herself by\norganizing a pole-dancing studio in the four-hundred-square-foot\ngarage of the house. She also found her own friends in physical fit-\nness and dance groups. She joined a New Age yoga studio called\nPhysical Phatness, as well as a local acrobatic performance group,\nand, on Friday nights, pole danced at the Mercury lounge in down-\ntown Honolulu.

However, we the Judeo-Christian West\nreally have to look at what he’s talking about as far as traditionalism goes — particularly\nthe sense of where it supports the underpinnings of nationalism — and I happen to think\nthat the individual sovereignty of a country is a good thing and a strong thing. I think\nstrong countries and strong nationalist movements in countries make strong neighbors,\nand that is really the building blocks that built Western Europe and the United States,\nand I think it’s what can see us forward.\n\nYou know, Putin’s been quite an interesting character. He’s also very, very, very\nintelligent. I can see this in the United States where he’s playing very strongly to social\nconservatives about his message about more traditional values, so I think it’s something\nthat we have to be very much on guard of.

How, specifically, should we as the West respond to Jihadism without\nlosing our own soul? Because we can win the war and lose ourselves at the same time.\nHow should the West respond to radical Islam and not lose itself in the process?\nBannon: From a perspective — this may be a little more militant than others. I think\ndefinitely you’re going to need an aspect that is [unintelligible]. I believe you should take\na very, very, very aggressive stance against radical Islam. And I realize there are other\naspects that are not as militant and not as aggressive and that’s fine.\n\nIf you look back at the long history of the Judeo-Christian West struggle against Islam, I\nbelieve that our forefathers kept their stance, and I think they did the right thing. I think\nthey kept it out of the world, whether it was at Vienna, or Tours, or other places... It\nbequeathed to use the great institution that is the church of the West.\n\nAnd I would ask everybody in the audience today, because you really are the movers and\ndrivers and shakers and thought leaders in the Catholic Church today, is to think, when\npeople 500 years from now are going to think about today, think about the actions you’ve\n\ntaken — and I believe everyone associated with the church and associated with the Judeo-\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_029082\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

I think of this game as the \"aren't you scared of the neighbors\" game.\nIn the \"aren't you scared of the neighbors\" game, I start making noise loud enough that I\nmight catch outsiders’ attention. Part of me is hoping that my partner is worried about the\nneighbors; that he'll relent, that I can use my tiny advantage to convince him to pull back.\nThat I can play for a moment of relief, a smidgen of mercy.\n\nOf course, if I'm lucky, my partners will then just order me to be quiet while they hurt\nme. Which creates a predicament! Because being quiet is actually not at all easy, and it\ngets more difficult the more it hurts.\n\nAnd then there's the distraction game. I don't always do BDSM with partners I'm sexually\nattracted to; even with partners I'm sexually attracted to, I don't always feel sexual during\nour BDSM encounters. But when I feel very attracted during a BDSM encounter, oh,\nman. That's when I play the distraction game, which involves attempting to distract him\nby turning him on. Again, I'm not really coherent enough to be planning strategy at times\nlike this; I'm more going on instinct; instinctively, it's like I'm trying to bargain. Maybe if\nI can turn him on, he'll have sex with me instead of hurting me....\n\nIf I'm lucky, he'll recognize what I'm doing; he'll be pleased, amused even, but he won't\nstop. One recent partner had me handcuffed to a car seat while he was hurting me. (Doing\nthis in his car was not my idea, but at least we weren't moving. Nor were we paused at a\ntraffic light.) I couldn't move too much, so I started licking his hand when he reached for\nme. Kissing his palm, his fingers -- he groaned, and then he laughed.\n\n\"You are a switch,\" he said, \"trying to control me even now.\" And he didn't stop.\n\nte ok ok\n\n\"No,\" I breathed, a few months ago, during an encounter with someone who's really good\nat this. \"You don't get to say no,” he replied, so I bit back the word. Had to fight against\nmy own desperate instinct to say it, over and over.\n\nLater, he murmured, \"It's so cute how you act like you don't want this,\" as he leaned in to\ninflict dark bruises on my shoulder. His words almost brought me to tears. But J don't\nwant it. Do 1? How can I want something that hurts like this? But I'm not stopping him --\ndid I really ask for this -- I must want it -- Forcing me to face up to my own consent: a\npredicament?\n\nI fought back when he hurt me, instinctively pushing him away. \"Don't push me away,”\nhe instructed. \"Put your arms around me,\" and I did.

These numbers are astounding and\nby themselves speak volumes for Republican prospects in 2016. And it is not just the Trump phenomenon; it’s the Trump\nphenomenon plus much more.\n\nBut, the situation is worse for Democrats. When juxtaposed to the Democratic turnout in 2008 and 2016, the 2016 Republican\nturnout looks even stronger. Remember, the 2012 Democratic primary was a non-event because President Obama, then a\nsitting President, was running for nomination essentially uncontested. We therefore focus exclusively on the change from the\n2008 to the 2016 Democratic Party turnout, which, using the same states, is down in total by 20.1%. And, using equal-weighted\nstate numbers, it’s down by 16.2%. Ona state-by-state comparison, Republican turnout is way up, and Democratic turnout is\nway down. Someone should ring the Democratic alarm bell.\n\nAnd, even head-to-head comparisons of absolute voter turnout between the Democratic and Republican primaries in 2016\nand 2008 give the Republicans a definite edge for the elections of 2016 and an enormous increase over 2008. So far in 2016,\nthere have been 3.5 million more Republicans voting in their party’s primaries than there have been Democrats. In 2008, the\nDemocrats had over 11.3 million additional primary voter advantage over their Republican counterparts. This enormous\nincrease in Republican voter turnout over Democrats in 2016 plus the fact that there are more Republican voters in 2016 than\nDemocratic voters should be perhaps the single most disturbing statistic if you are a Hillary supporter, especially given the\nexceptional enthusiasm for Bernie Sanders in what has turned out to be a down primary turnout for Democrats.\n\nEven on a state-by-state basis, the flip from Democrat to Republican has been pronounced. So far in this 2016 primary season,\nthere are 14 new states that had Republican turnout in excess of Democratic turnout, i.e. those states in 2008 had more\nDemocratic turnout than Republican turnout, while in 2016 Republican turnout exceeds Democratic turnout. These states are\nnot, as Bernie Sanders would say, “chopped liver.” They include Arkansas, Georgia, Indiana, Mississippi, Missouri, New\nHampshire, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia and Wisconsin. When it comes to\nthe electoral college, flipping a state is far more important than is increasing the margin of victory.\n\nWhat should be even more alarming to the Democrats than the party flip against Democrats in the 14 states that have already\nhad primaries is the fact that so far in every state, save Michigan, Democratic voter advantage over Republican’s has declined.\nAnd Michigan, without trying to reach too far for excuses, appears to hinge on the tragedy of the Flint water contamination and\nMitt Romney’s candidacy in 2008 and 2012. And so as not to take everything away from the unique Michigan phenomenon,\nit still must be remembered that in both 2008 and 2016, Republican primary turnout in Michigan was greater than Democratic\nturnout.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_025302\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

L. Rev. 844, *894\n\nbranch is firmly committed to a robust enforcement policy against local government corruption that is also criminalized under\nstate law, and Congress has supported this agenda by enacting federal crimes intended to duplicate, or greatly overlap, state\noffenses. !°4 In fact, federal statutes used in anti-corruption cases - [*895] like other federal criminal statutes - rely on and\nincorporate state law in federal offense definitions. In light of this structure, federal prosecutions can claim to effectuate state\n\nlaw goals - an especially straightforward version of federalism-based enforcement redundancy. !®\n\n2. Sexual Assault\n\nIn sharp contrast to public corruption, enforcement redundancy through coextensive jurisdiction is largely nonexistent for a\nlarge portion of the serious crimes that dominate state felony dockets, including sexual assaults, domestic violence, and\nhomicide. '°° Federal law reaches only a small number of these offenses when they intersect a special basis for federal\njurisdiction, such as interstate conduct - like human trafficking - or wrongs that occur on federal property or involve federal\nemployees. '®’ For most kinds of homicides, the lack of redundancy is only a modest hindrance to adequate enforcement;\nholding aside distinctive exceptions - such as homicides by police or racially motivated lynchings - there 1s little evidence to\nsuggest patterns of homicide underenforcement in state justice systems. '°® Domestic violence and sexual assaults are a\ndifferent story. Like local public corruption, sexual assaults have long been a key example of [*896] serious wrongdoing to\nwhich the responses of state and local criminal justice agencies have been deeply problematic. 1°\n\nUnderenforcement is hard to measure for sexual assaults as it is in other contexts, but central features of the problem are clear\nenough. Rape and other forms of sexual assault are dramatically underreported crimes. !7° The leading government effort to\ncollect data on sexual assaults (and other crimes), the National Crime Victimization Survey, is widely thought to undercount\nincidents of those offenses. '7! And rates of victim reports to police departments are even lower. The FBI Uniform Crime\nReports collects data on sexual assaults reported to local police agencies; the number is consistently well below the annual\nnumber reported in the National Crime Victimization Survey. !7*\n\nOne reason that victims do not to report rapes to law enforcement is the perception that police and prosecutors (as well as\njuries) are unduly skeptical of rape allegations.

Thus, if the temptation is\nlow, player 1 gets a > 0 if she cooperates and q > a if she defects. If the temptation is\nhigh, she gets a if she cooperates and cp, > c if she defects. We assume that cooperation\nbenefits the other player, which we refer to as player 2. We assume, for simplicity, that\nplayer 2 gets 6 > 0 if 1 cooperates and d < 0 if 1 defects, and that these payoffs to player 2\nare the same regardless of 1’s temptation. For now, we also assume that d < p/(1 —p)-;\nthat is, defection is sufficiently harmful to player 2 that player 2 prefers to avoid the\ninteraction if player 1 only cooperates some of the time. Finally, we model player 2’s\ntrust in player 1. We model this by giving player 2 the choice of whether to continue\nthe interaction with player 1. If player 2 continues the interaction, then with probability\nw, all previous steps are repeated, potentially indefinitely. That is, the temptation to\ndefect is randomly chosen again, player 1 chooses whether to look at it, and so on. With\nprobability 1 — w, the game ends. The parameter w can be interpreted as the likelihood\nof a future interaction or the player’s discounting of future payoffs. Crucially, we assume\nthat player 2 observes both of player 1’s choices: not only whether 1 cooperated, but\nalso whether 1 first looked. Our model, therefore, applies to situations where player 1’s\nlooking is somewhat observable, for example, if player 1 can gain additional information\nabout the costs of defection by asking player 2 questions, or if player 1 can take time to\nponder the decision and player 2 can observe player 1’s reaction time. We assume that\nplayers maximize their expected payoffs. Note that since we assumed a > 0 and 6 > 0,\nboth players benefit from a cooperative interaction.\n\nIn the envelope game, a strategy for player 1 dictates whether she will look and whether\nshe will cooperate, as a function of whether she has looked and cooperated in the past,\nand as a function of the temptation if she has just looked. For example, one relatively\n\nsimple strategy for player 1 is to look and cooperate whenever the temptation is low.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_026524\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

But in the immediate\naftermath of the attack, Israel deliberately made no public comment. We refused to\nsay whether we’d had anything to do with an attack. As we he had hoped, this\nallowed the Syrian President, Bashar al-Assad, both the space and a good reason to\ndeny that it had ever happened, deny that he’d been trying to make a nuclear\nweapon, and thus feel no compelling reason to retaliate.\n\nThe reactor operation, however, marked the start of an increasingly tough\nperiod in both my and Tzipi’s relationship with Olmert.

But in the\nspring of 2008, it became known that the Israeli police were investigating Olmert’s\nrelationship with an American businessman named Moshe Talansky.

Each month thereafter the case was postponed\nbecause we were aware that it was being brought to ARCOM. Now that this matter has been resolved\nwith ARCOM we will proceed with a code enforcement case until the property is in compliance (meaning\nthey plant the shrubbery and hedges approved by the Town).\nSgt. Krauel or Rob Walton will be available on July 23rd as I will be attending a conference.\nH. Case # 08-2484, 515 N. County Road, Trump Properties, LLC\nViolation of Chapter 18, Section 18-205 of the Town of Palm Beach Code of\nOrdinances, the Architectural Commission may attach conditions to any approval it grants\n(Declaration of Use Agreement).\nLead Code Enforcement Walton presented the facts of the case and said the previous\nowner of the property, Abe Gosman, had been granted approval by the Architectural\nCommission to do some remodeling. One of the conditions of this approval was that the\nhedge along the front of the property be maintained in the condition it was in at the time the\napproval was granted. This agreement was a binding agreement, which passes on to any\nsubsequent property owner. The agreement was made January 31, 1990. The subsequent\nbuyer of this property was Mr. Trump, Trump Properties, LLC and some remodeling work\nwas done, removing the previous hedge. A new hedge was planted to replace the original\nhedge and that one has now been removed. This is a violation of the agreement. A letter was\nreceived from Mr. Royce, representing Mr. Trump, asking for a postponement of today’s\nhearing. The Town does not feel this matter should be postponed.\nMr. Randolph summarized the letter from Mr. Royce which indicated the ficus\nhedge keeps dying and they want to replace it with something different. They plan on hiring a\nlandscape architect to go before the next Architectural Commission meeting to get approval to\ninstall a hedge in an attempt to meet the conditions of the declaration of use agreement. Mr.\nRandolph said he had discussions with Mr. Royce and Mr. Walton and Mr. Royce was told the\nTown could not recommend a postponement and the recommendation would be that they are\nfound in violation, assessed the $150.00 in administrative costs and be given until June 18th,\nwhich is the day before the June Code Enforcement Board meeting, to comply. This would\ngive them the opportunity to appear before the Architectural Commission to see if they can get\napproval to re-plant a hedge. The hedge has to be installed to the height which existed at the\ntime of the agreement which Mr. Randolph said he believed was twenty-two (22) feet. Mr.\nRandolph said Mr. Royce was not present today because he had a planned vacation.\nMOTION BY MR. FRIED TO FIND THE VIOLATOR IN NON-\nCOMPLIANCE, ASSESS ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS OF $150.00 AND GIVE THEM\nUNTIL JUNE 18, 2008 TO COMPLY.\nSECONDED BY MS.

You likely know that ARCOM is working\nwith Mr. Trump to re-install a hedge on his North County Road property. I believe this case is now\npending in front of Code Enforcement. In May, ARCOM approved a plan to replace the former hedge\nwith silver buttonwood shrubbery, which would additionally be back-planted with silver buttonwood\ntrees....the overall effect would be an eventual 20' high screen. The shrubs have been planted, but\nyesterday attorney Ray Royce asked for postponing the trees until the end of the Hurricane season.\nARCOM said NO and directed the attorney and landscaper to get the trees in ASAP. Also, more\nshrubbery was required at the main entry (north side) to match the newly installed hedge on the south\nside.\nAs the meeting was ending, the Commissioners asked for one of two things. They asked that either 1) a\nquick written report from Code Enforcement be made available to them at their next meeting on July 23\n(9:00 a.m.) about the enforcement status of the case, or 2) that someone from Code Enforcement attend\ntheir meeting to provide a verbal status report. Their patience is wearing thin with the whole hedge issue,\nand it has them naturally curious about what is happening with their counterparts on Code Enforcement.\nWould you or the appropriate representative from Code Enforcement be available on July 23? That\nwould be my preference because follow-up questions almost always pop up. If not, can you provide me\nwith a brief summary of your enforcement history and pending status?

Moreover, eligibility for reimbursement\ndoes not imply that any drug will be paid for in all cases or at a rate that covers a portfolio\ncompany’s costs, including research, development, manufacture, sale and distribution. Interim\nreimbursement levels for new drugs, if applicable, may also not be sufficient to cover a portfolio\ncompany’s costs and may not be made permanent. Reimbursement rates may vary according to\nthe use of the drug and the clinical setting in which it is used, may be based on reimbursement\nlevels already set for lower cost drugs, and may be incorporated into existing payments for\nother services. Net prices for drugs may be reduced by mandatory discounts or rebates required\nby government healthcare programs or private payors and by any future relaxation of laws that\npresently restrict imports of drugs from countries where they may be sold at lower prices than\nin the United States. Third-party payors often rely upon Medicare coverage policy and payment\nlimitations in setting their own reimbursement policies. A portfolio company’s inability to\npromptly obtain coverage and profitable payment rates from both government-funded and\nprivate payors for any approved products that a portfolio company may develop could have a\nmaterial adverse effect on its operating results, its ability to raise capital needed to\ncommercialize products and its overall financial condition. This, in turn, could negatively affect\nthe performance of the Fund.\n\nPolitical Risk; Current and Future Healthcare Reforms\n\nPolitical events can have an impact on pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies. There can\nbe no guarantee that government's role in the healthcare industry will not adversely impact the\nperformance of the Fund.\n\nIn both the U.S. and foreign markets, sales of healthcare products and services and their success\nwill depend in part on the availability of reimbursement from third-party payors such as\ngovernment health administration authorities, private health insurers, and other organizations.\nThe levels of revenues and profitability of providers of healthcare products and services may be\naffected by the continuing efforts of governmental and third-party payors to contain or reduce\nthe costs of health care. Significant uncertainty exists as to the reimbursement status of newly\napproved health care products. There can be no assurance that a company’s proposed products\nor services will be considered cost-effective or that adequate third-party reimbursement will be\navailable to enable a company to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return\non its investment.\n\nMoreover, there continues to be significant interest among policy makers and government and\nprivate payors in the United States and foreign jurisdictions in promoting changes in healthcare\nsystems to contain healthcare costs and improve the overall quality of care and wellness.\n\nFor example, on March 23, 2010, President Obama signed into law the Patient Protection and\nAffordable Care Act, which Congress modified pursuant to the Health Care and Education\nReconciliation Act of 2010 (collectively, the “Act”). The Act expands insurance coverage to\nmore individuals, which could have a negative impact on the pharmaceutical industry. Among\nthe aspects of the Act that may have an adverse impact on the Fund are (i) mandatory annual\nfees on pharmaceutical manufacturers, (ii) discounts of 50% on brand name prescription drugs\nfor certain Medicare Part D beneficiaries (i.e., those who are required to pay 100% of their\n\n60 CONTROL NUMBER 257 - CONFIDENTIAL\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_024071\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

A number of others managed to escape when the bus was stopped. But\nseveral dozen remained inside.\n\nI was in Europe at the time, on one of my periodic trips to discuss Middle\nEast issues with a fellow intelligence chief. Yet an aide called me with the news.\nI was several thousand miles away from what happening. But I knew there was\nevery possibility Sayeret Matkal might be called in, and my instincts told me we\nshould proceed with caution. The situation we were facing felt nothing like\nSabena, much less Entebbe. Here, we had a single bus. Our troops, and in fact\neveryone from ministers and officials to reporters and photographers, were in a\nloose cordon a couple of dozen yards away. That said to me there was no sense\nthat the hijackers posed an immediate danger. Nor did they seem to have come\nequipped for a major confrontation. In place of the AK-47s and grenades we’d\nseen in previous terror attacks, these guys had knives, and, if they were to be\nbelieved, a couple of shells with no obvious way to detonate them.\n\nI phoned a friend in the command post set up near the stranded bus. He told\nme that Misha and Moshe Vechetzi were there. There was a standoff with the\nterrorists and, for now, it was quiet. The defense minister and the chief-of-staff,\nof course, did not need my presence, much less my agreement, to order the\nsayeret into action. But I said: why not wait? Though the last flights back to\nIsrael had already left, I could be at the command post by mid-morning. Beyond\nwanting to be present if the sayeret was ordered in, I believed the crisis might\neven be brought to an end without another shot being fired. “III tell them what\nyou said,” my friend replied. “But I doubt it’Il be allowed to drag on much past\ndaybreak.”\n\nHe was right. With my Chinese Farm comrade Yitzhik Mordechai in overall\ncommand, Sayeret Matkal stormed the bus at about seven in the morning. They\nshot and killed two of the hijackers immediately, through the vehicle’s windows.\nSadly one of the passengers, a young woman soldier, died in the assault, but the\nrest of the hostages were freed, none with serious injuries.\n\nA controversy soon erupted over what came next. The sayeret commandos\nhad captured the other two terrorists alive and uninjured. Yet barely a week later,\nfirst in an American newspaper and then the Israeli media, reports emerged that\nthe two surviving Palestinians had been killed after the hijacking was over. A\nyear later, Yitzhik Mordechai was — wrongly — put on trial for his alleged part in\nwhat had amounted to a summary execution. And, rightly, exonerated. Though\nthe full details never became public, the people responsible turned out to be from\nthe Shin Bet, our equivalent of the FBI.\n\n214\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_011685\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

The\nbrother traded on that information for a profit,\nand also tipped his brother-in-law, Mr. Salman,\nwho also traded for a profit. At trial, the government\nrelied solely on the tippers giving a gift of\ninside information to a close family member to\nsatisfy the “personal benefit” requirement of tipper-tippee\ninsider trading liability. The government\ndid not identify any money or other valuable quid\npro quo paid for the tip. Salman was convicted at\ntrial, and his conviction was upheld by the Court\nof Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.\n(continued on page 3)\nClient Alert: Status of the New DOL Fiduciary Rule (continued from page 1)\na better commission for the adviser. The Obama\nadministration found that conflicted advice cost\nsavers about $17 billion a year based on a 2015\nreport. To be clear, the Rule applies only to retirement\naccounts like 401(k)s and individual retirement\naccounts (“IRAs”), not to regular taxable\naccounts. According to the Investment Company\nInstitute, Americans invest $7.8 trillion in IRAs\nand $7 trillion in 401(k)s.\nOn January 20, 2017, the DOL issued two new\nsets of Frequently Asked Questions (“FAQs”) on\nthe Rule. One of the sets of FAQs focuses on the\nnew definition of fiduciary investment advice\nand the other set is geared toward retirement\ninvestors and consumers, covering consumer\nprotection features of the new Rule. This is the\nsecond of three rounds of guidance to be published\nby the DOL prior to the effective date of\nthe new Rule.\nThe Executive Branch also issued responses to\nthe Rule on January 20, 2017. The White House\nissued a Memorandum from Reince Priebus to the\nheads of the executive departments and agencies\nrequesting a sixty (60)-day delay as the effective\ndate of regulations published in the Office of the\nFederal Register have not taken effect as of yet.\nOn February 3, 2017, President Trump signed a\npresidential memorandum to delay the Rule by\nsix (6)-months, casting doubt on its viability.\nThe memorandum instructs the DOL to conduct\na new “economic and legal analysis” to determine\nwhether the Rule is likely to harm investors,\ndisrupt the industry or cause an increase\nin litigation and the price of advice. If the DOL\nconcludes that the regulation does hurt investors\nor firms, it can propose a rule “rescinding\nor revising” the regulation. On March 1,\n2017, the DOL issued a proposed rule, which\nwill extend the applicability date of its fiduciary\nrule, including the Best Interest Contract\nExemption, from April 10, 2017 to June 9, 2017,\na 60-day delay.\nSome are saying the Rule would hurt investors\nbecause it would supposedly make it harder\nfor people to receive retirement advice. For\nexample, advisers would not be able to afford\nto service low-balance retirement accounts.\nOn the other hand, consumer, labor and civil\nrights groups have pushed for the Rule saying\nthat the current system provides a loophole\nthat lets brokers drain money from retirement\naccounts in fees they receive that can sway\nthe investment advice they give their retirement\naccounts. We see that many retirement\nadvisers already have chosen to act in their\nclients’ best interests, opting to work under\nthe fiduciary standard—it is ultimately a\nbusiness advantage.\nThe FAQs are available on the DOL’s website\nand the Memoranda are available on the White\nHouse Press Office website.\nFAQs\nhttps://www.dol.gov/sites/default/files/ebsa/\nabout-ebsa/our-activities/resource-center/\nfaqs/coi-rules-and-exemptions-part-2.pdf\nhttps://www.dol.gov/sites/default/files/ebsa/\nabout-ebsa/our-activities/resource-center/faqs/\nconsumer-protections-for-retirement-investorsyour-rights-and-financial-advisers.pdf\nMemoranda\nJanuary 20, 2017–Regulatory Freeze Pending\nReview\nhttps://www.whitehouse.gov/the-pressoffice/2017/01/20/memorandum-heads-executive-departments-and-agencies\nFebruary 3, 2017–Fiduciary Duty Rule\nhttps://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/\n2017/02/03/ presidential-memorandum-fiduciaryduty-rule\nDaniel G.

The Court reasoned\nthat such a gift can be inferred to “provide\nthe equivalent of a cash gift.” 3 Specifically, the\nCourt reasoned that if the tipper personally traded\non inside information himself for a profit, but gave\nthe proceeds to his brother, the tipper received a\npersonal benefit (cash) and is liable for insider\ntrading. So, it reasoned, where a tipper achieves\neffectively the same result by gifting the information\nto his brother with the expectation that the\nbrother will trade on the information to obtain a\ncash profit, the result should be the same.\nImportantly, the Supreme Court explicitly stated\nthat it was narrowing the Second Circuit’s landmark\nNewman decision. It stated, “[t]o the extent\nthe Second Circuit held that the tipper must also\nreceive something of a ‘pecuniary or similarly\nvaluable nature’ in exchange for a gift to family\nor friends,… we agree with the Ninth Circuit that\nthis requirement is inconsistent with Dirks,” a prior\nSupreme Court ruling. 4 This significantly lowers the\nstandard of proof for insider trading tipping liability\nin cases involving family or friends. The government\noften cannot find evidence of money or a similarly\nvaluable quid pro quo between the tipper and\ntippee in insider trading cases. So it is much easier\nto prove a case of insider trading by arguing that\nthe exchange of information was a “gift,” which\nessentially only requires some evidence (even circumstantial\nevidence such as phone logs) that the\ntipper gave information to the tippee.\nSo where does this leave the Newman decision?\nThe Newman decision itself was not overturned by\nthe Supreme Court, because Newman also relied\non the lack of proof that the tippees who traded on\ninside information knew that the tippers provided\nSalman significantly lowers\nthe standard of proof for\ninsider trading tipping\nliability in cases involving\nfamily or friends.\ninside information in exchange for a personal benefit—especially\nsince the tippees were several\nsteps removed from the original tippers. In addition,\nNewman‘s “pecuniary or similarly valuable”\nbenefit test should still apply to cases that do not\ninvolve tipping family or friends.\nNevertheless, the Salman decision tips the scales\nback in favor of the government in tipping insider\ntrading cases. The SEC and federal prosecutors\nhave shown in the past that they will bring cases\nbased on alleged gifts of inside information to\nmere social acquaintances, fellow employees, or\nnetworking contacts —using strained arguments\nof “friendship.” And they will bring insider trading\ncases based solely on circumstantial evidence\n(e.g., a pattern of phone calls) where there is no\ndirect proof of trading based on inside information.\nAccordingly, with Salman imposing a lower\nstandard of proof, it is imperative that clients\ncontact counsel immediately at the first hint of a\ngovernment insider trading investigation.\n1\nSalman v.

HIRSCH AND JENNIFER ROSSAN\nEmployers should give careful consideration to\nthe inclusion of non-competition provisions in\nemployment agreements for low-level employees.\nThe New York Attorney General (the “AG”) recently\nannounced that it settled investigations with two\ncompanies over their use of non-compete provisions\nin employment agreements for low-level\nemployees. Policing non-compete provisions is a\nnew regulatory frontier for the AG and it is flexing\nits regulatory muscle pursuant to § 63 (12) of\nNew York’s Executive Law, which provides the AG\nwith authority to enjoin businesses from utilizing\n“unconscionable contractual provisions.” 1\nThe AG investigated and recently settled charges\nwith two companies—Law 360 and Jimmy John’s\nGourmet Sandwiches—based on their use of\n“unconscionable” non-compete provisions in\nemployment contracts. In the Law 360 matter, the\nAttorney General found that Law 360’s policy of\nrequiring the majority of its employees—including\n“rank and file” editorial staff who had little to\nno knowledge of any trade secrets or confidential\ninformation—to sign a one-year non-compete was\ncontrary to New York law. Because these employees\ndid not have access to trade secrets and confidential\ninformation, the AG charged that the noncompete\nwas not narrowly tailored to Law 360’s\nlegitimate business interests and did nothing more\nthan baldly restrain competition. As part of the settlement,\nLaw 360 agreed that, going forward, only\na small number of its highly paid executives would\nbe required to sign non-compete agreements.\nSimilarly, in its investigation of Jimmy John’s, the\nAG found that some franchisees required sandwich\nmakers to sign two-year non-competes that prevented\nthem from working at any establishment\nwithin a two-mile radius of a Jimmy John’s location\nthat made more than 10% of its revenue from\nsandwiches. The AG charged that these employees\n“are highly unlikely to be privy to trade secrets\nor confidential customer lists or to have unique\nskills.” Consequently, the AG concluded that the\nnon-compete provisions were “unconscionable”.\nAs part of its settlement, Jimmy John’s agreed to\ninform its franchisees that the AG found the noncompete\nprovisions to be unlawful and void.\nIn both of these cases, the AG focused on the\neffect of a non-compete provision on a low-level\nemployee. Companies should consider avoiding\nthe use of non-compete provisions for administrative\npersonnel and other non-managerial\nstaff. Such provisions are appropriate and are\nmore likely to withstand scrutiny when included\nin the employment agreements of senior personnel\nand individuals with unique skills—as\nlong as the provisions are drafted to protect a\nlegitimate business interest. Non-competes are\nNon-competes are more\nlikely to be upheld if they\nare designed to ensure that\na departing employee will\nnot provide a competitor\nwith an unfair competitive\nadvantage by supplying it\nwith the former employer’s\ntrade secrets and/or\nconfidential information.\nmore likely to be upheld if they are designed to\nensure that a departing employee will not provide\na competitor with an unfair competitive advantage\nby supplying it with the former employer’s\ntrade secrets and/or confidential information.\nHowever, it is important to note that requiring\nall employees—including lower-level staff—to\nadhere to confidentiality provisions that protect\nproprietary information and trade secrets\ndoes not implicate the same concerns, because\nenforcement of such provisions does not restrain\nthe employee from working elsewhere. Therefore,\nconfidentiality provisions should be used in all\nemployment agreements where the employee’s\nposition involves access to confidential information\nor trade secrets.\nEven when a non-compete is appropriate—\nsuch as in the case of a senior manager whose\ndeparture would create an unfair advantage for\na competitor—its scope and duration must be\nnarrowly tailored to protect a legitimate business\ninterest. To be enforceable in New York,\na non-compete must be reasonable in time\nand scope, necessary to protect the employer’s\nlegitimate interests, not harmful to the public\nand not unreasonably burdensome to the\nemployee.\nIn addition to confidentiality provisions, employers\nshould strongly consider the use of a non-solicitation\nprovision in their employment agreements.\nNon-solicitation provisions are generally enforceable\nif they are reasonably related to the employer’s\ninterest in protecting relationships with clients\nthe employee worked with or became familiar with\nwhile employed. But like non-compete agreements,\nnon-solicitation provisions must also be\nlimited in time and scope.\n1\nSee New York Executive Law § 63 (12).\nDouglas R.

GEFFNER AND YEHUDA BRAUNSTEIN\nReprinted with permission of Hedgeweek\nWith the Trump administration in the White House,\nregulatory uncertainty permeates the financial\nservices industry. While many on Wall Street are\nvery excited by the Trump presidency, others are\napproaching this new era with trepidation. President\nTrump is unpredictable in many ways, and the\nindustry eagerly awaits his actions hoping that the\nfinancial markets do not respond negatively and\ncreate chaos in the global marketplace.\nWhile we should expect that the Trump administration\nwill aim to cut back financial regulation implemented\nduring the last eight years, it is unrealistic to expect\nthat these laws will be eliminated in their entirety.\nThough the financial markets have been extremely\nvolatile of late and react very swiftly upon the\nannouncement of any meaningful global news, various\naspects of recent financial regulation have been\npositive for the industry. For example, the requirement\nfor many investment advisers to register with the U.S.\nSecurities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), one\nof the requirements of The Dodd–Frank Wall Street\nReform and Consumer Protection Act (“Dodd Frank”)\nwhich was signed into federal law by President\nObama to be effective as of July 21, 2010, in retrospect,\nhas been viewed as a positive change within\nthe industry. Understandably, when initially introduced\nin 2010, many asset managers located within\nthe United States and abroad that were required to\nregister as investment advisers with the SEC as a\nresult of Dodd-Frank were opposed to the changes.\nHowever, many advisers, investors and regulators\nnow agree that requiring a larger number of advisers\nto be accountable to higher regulatory standards has\ncreated an environment where investors and counterparties\nhave more confidence in the oversight of\nthose managers and the industry as a whole.\nIt is also important to remember that any time\nthe government or a regulator changes the laws,\nrules or regulations, those businesses affected\nincur capital and opportunity costs in connection\nwith analyzing the changes in law and implementing\noperational changes to comply with the new\nlaws. For example, when Dodd-Frank was originally\nenacted, at the time of registration, those\ninvestment advisers that were required to register\nas advisers with the SEC were required to adopt\nwritten policies and procedures and invested capital\ninto their operations and technology to support\ncompliance. Therefore, we expect that caution will\nbe exercised before significant change is made to\navoid the various costs associated with implementing\nchange. A case in point is the new DOL\nRule (discussed earlier in this newsletter), originally\nset to take effect on April 10, 2017. Investment\nadvisers impacted by the DOL Rule, have\nalready been forced to analyze the DOL Rule and\nits impact on their businesses, and some advisers\nhave already begun to implement changes to their\noperations and procedures. The DOL Rule has been\nthe subject of much debate. While some industry\nexperts believe that the DOL Rule is onerous and\nmaterially increases the costs associated with\nproviding services to clients, supporters of the\nDOL Rule believe that it is necessary to protect\ninvestors against brokers who are unnecessarily\nselling high-fee investments to their clients. On\nFebruary 3, 2017, President Trump signed a memorandum\nto delay the DOL Rule by six (6)-months.\nOn March 1, 2017, the DOL issued a proposed\nrule, which will extend the applicability date of its\nfiduciary rule, including the Best Interest Contract\nExemption, from April 10, 2017 to June 9, 2017, a\n60-day delay. If the DOL Rule is ultimately modified\nor even eliminated, some advisers may have to\nreverse their recently-implemented changes.\nIn conclusion, we do not believe that regulations\nin the financial industry will be eliminated in their\nentirety. For example, if the requirement to register\nas an investment adviser with the SEC is materially\nmodified or no longer required, we expect that many\ninvestment advisers would maintain their registration\nas it is perceived to be a competitive advantage\ncompared to those managers that are not registered.\nWhile we expect the Trump administration to improve\nthe financial services industry by having more balanced\nregulations, we believe that this administration\nwill quickly realize that there are a lot of reasonable\nand sensible regulations currently in place that are\nworking well, and that eliminating rules wholesale\ncan create chaos in the financial markets and may\ncome at a high price to their constituents.\nRon S.

However, it is considered a best practice and it is\nrecommended that an adviser delivers Form ADV Part 2 to each investor in a pooled investment vehicle.\n2\nAlthough Regulation S-P does not specify the exact day by which the annual privacy notice must\nbe sent, May 30 seems to be an appropriate date because the mailing can be coordinated with\ndelivery of Form ADV Part 2 (which can include the Privacy Policy) to clients or fund investors.\n3\nThe Investment Advisers Act of 1940 does not specify that any training session is necessary, and\ntherefore the date on which training should occur is not specified. However, a registered adviser\nmust distribute and receive signed acknowledgements of changes to its code of ethics. Since the\ncode (as well as an adviser’s compliance policies and procedures) may be amended as part of\nan adviser’s annual review, as well as at any other time, quarterly training should help to keep\npersonnel up-to-date regarding policies and procedures and otherwise remind personnel of their\ncompliance obligations.\nSEC & FINRA RELEASE 2017 EXAM PRIORITIES\nBY DANIEL G. VIOLA\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”)\nreleased their Exam Priorities for 2017. The SEC’s\n2017 priorities are organized around the following\nareas: (1) examining matters of importance to retail\ninvestors; (2) focusing on risks specific to elderly\nand retiring investors; and (3) assessing marketwide\nrisks. FINRA also issued its 2017 Regulatory\nand Examinations Priorities Letter, which identifies\ncompliance, supervision and risk management as\nareas of focus. FINRA will be introducing a compliance\ncalendar and a directory of service providers\nas tools to assist firms.

According to the policies set down\nunder Xi Jinping’s leadership, talking in classrooms\nabout Mao's errors is now forbidden.’5\n\nThe drive to inculcate a national amnesia on the\nworst abuses of the Communist era is not limited to\nuniversity courses. Commentary and discussion in the\nmedia and on the internet are also heavily censored,\nespecially on anniversary days when, in normal\nsocieties, problematic events of the past are remem-\nbered and debated.** The most sensitive anniversary,\nof course, falls on June 4, marking the deadly 1989\ncrackdown on prodemocracy protests in Tiananmen\nSquare. Even the most oblique or coded reference to\nthat date on social media is quickly censored.\n\nThere are no museums cevoted the Cultural Rev-\nolution or the Great Leap Forward. The archives of\nthe Cultural Revolution period are mainly closed to\nresearchers. Chinese historians have made some im-\nportant breakthroughs, but can discuss their findings\nonly with small groups of peers.\n\nThe Communist Party's refusal to come to terms with\nthe crimes of the Mao era has enabled a revival of\nthe former leader's personality cult that has captured\nthe support of millions of Chinese. As Jamil Anderlini\nwrote in the Financial Times, Mao has come to be\nseen as a symbol of a “simpler, fairer society—a time\nwhen everyone was poorer but at least they were\nequally poor.””” Xi and his colleagues have actively\npromoted Maoist images, songs, and propaganda\nthemes as ornaments of Chinese nationalism, and\nused Mao-style tactics and terminology in their drive\nfor ideological discipline and political loyalty.\n\nThe melding of nationalism and reverence for Mao is\nno accident. According to the regime's updated histor-\nical narrative, China was subjugated by foreign powers\nfor more than a century until the party took power in\n1949 and restored the country’s national greatness.\nAdmitting Mao's abuses would mean admitting that\nthe first three decades of Communist rule left China\npoor, isolated, and traumatized, and that only the\npartial abandonment of party doctrine and control\nallowed the country to prosper.\n\nA side effect of the party's appropriation of Chinese na-\ntionalism is a renewed hostility toward the foreign pow-\n\ners that kept China weak before Communist rule. Basic\nhistory textbooks—in addition to omitting or distorting\nthe mistakes, failures, and criminal acts of the Commu-\nnist leadership—focus on China's persecution at the\nhands of outsiders, especially Japan. Some Chinese\ncritics worry that the teaching of history is cultivating\nan alarming degree of xenophobia and jingoism.”°\n\nHistory held hostage\n\nIn much of the world today, there are or have been\nmajor efforts to confront uncomfortable truths\n\nabout the past. This is certainly true of Germany and\nSouth Africa. Latin American countries like Chile and\nArgentina have probed the histories of ugly conflicts\nbetween military juntas and Marxist revolutionaries. In\nChina's own backyard, South Korea and Taiwan have\nmoved to address the complex legacies, including\noutright crimes, of dictators.\n\nThe process of accounting for the mistakes and\ncrimes of earlier decades can raise a tangle of ethical\nand emotional challenges in any country. But resis-\ntance to a full examination of the past is especially\nbitter in societies where communism held sway. In\nChina, the heirs of Mao still control the state, and the\nvery legitimacy of the system is built on a veneration\nof the Great Helmsman. In Russia, the Putin leader-\nship praises the achievements of Stalin and aspires to\nthe superpower status of the Soviet Union. A conse-\nquence of this ahistorical nostalgia is that in Russia\ntoday, 26 percent of those polled by Levada believe\nthat Stalinist repression was necessary; a decade\nago, the figure was just 9 percent. Likewise, only 45\npercent told Levada that political persecution was a\ncrime; in 2007, the figure was 72 percent.”\n\nThe communist system was responsible for four of\n\nthe most destructive episodes of the 20th century:\nStalin’s purges, the Great Leap Forward, the Cultural\nRevolution, and the Cambodian genocide. Add to this\nthe persecutions inflicted on the people of the Baltic\nstates, Eastern Europeans, Cubans, North Koreans,\nand many others, and the population affected by mass\nkillings and misery swells even further. While few peo-\nple today admire totalitarian Marxism as a governing\nsystem, there is a reluctance to reject it with the same\nmoral clarity as in assessments of Nazism. Scholars,\nnot to mention political figures, who express even mod-\nest admiration for Hitler are immediately and properly\ncondemned. As long as Stalin and Mao, two of history's\nworst mass murderers, escape similar opprobrium in\ntheir own countries, a reckoning with historical truth\nand an understanding of its lessons will be postponed.\n\nwww.freedomhouse.org\n\n33\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_019267\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

But there was no fight. I was approved, the dean later told me, by a unanimous vote.\n\nSeveral years after I began teaching, I was invited to deliver a distinguished named lectureship at\na major university. Following my talk, there was a dinner in my honor at the local university club.\nWhen I got to the club, there were several women standing outside picketing because it was a\nmen’s only club. I refused to cross the picket line and the dinner had to be moved to a different\nvenue, over the strong objections of the Chief Justice of the State, who was one of the sponsors\nto the dinner. I had a similar experience in Columbus, Ohio, after I argued an important case on\nbehalf of a local law firm. They invited my female associate and me to have dinner with them at\nthe local university club. When we got there, they asked my associate if she wouldn’t mind\nwalking in through the side door since the main entrance was for men only. Since she was a\nyoung associate, she reluctantly agreed, but I refused to let her demean herself. We had lunch at\nthe local McDonald’s. Several years later, I was invited to Australia to give a series of lectures,\nand the Harvard Club of Sydney asked me to give a luncheon talk to Harvard alumni. I agreed.\nWhen I mentioned to a friend that I was going to be speaking at the Australia Club, he advised me\nthat it was closed to Jews, women, and Blacks. I gave the Harvard Club two options: I would\nkeep my commitment and make my speech, but I would speak about why it was wrong for\nHarvard to hold events at segregated clubs; or they could move the speech and I would give a talk\nabout life at Harvard. They chose the second alternative. When I returned to Harvard, I wrote to\nthe dean and a memo was circulated mandating that henceforth no Harvard professors, speaking\non behalf of Harvard, should appear in a segregated venue. When a Jewish country club in\nBoston asked me to talk, I told them about my policy and declined the invitation. They explained\nthat the club had been established in reaction to the unwillingness of other country clubs in the\narea to accept Jewish members. I told them that I did not think this justified further\ndiscrimination. A few days later, the membership chairman called and told me that, in fact, the\nclub had six non-Jewish members and that it was open to accepting more. I made the speech. A\nyoung member approached me following my speech and told me I had been conned, “Sure, we\nhave six non-Jewish members, but they’re all sons-in-law of Jewish members.” I have never\nspoken at that club again.\n\nWhen I joined the faculty, it was quite small—perhaps two dozen full time professors. (Today\nthere are more than 100, with a student body that hasn’t increased in size.) The entire faculty\nwould meet for lunch every day in a small dining room around a large table presided over by the\ndean, and in his absence by a senior faculty member. The discussions would revolve around legal\nissues. The criteria for judging an argument and its maker was its “soundness.” That word still\nrings in my ear, like my grandmother’s “meturnished.” All faculty nominees had to have “sound”\njudgment. Their writing had to be “sound,” rather than creative, speculative, quirky or\nprovocative. I was concerned because my views were anything but “sound”—as least as judged\nby some of the more traditional faculty members.\n\nRecently, I told one of my long-time colleagues that when I was choosing between teaching at\n\nHarvard and Yale Law Schools, my Yale Law School teacher, mentor and friend, Professor Alex\nBickel, who had been turned down for a professorship at Harvard because his views of\n\n78\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_017165\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

Not all of them were naked, a lot\nof the ones that were all around his house were not naked girls posing pornographically,\nsome were pictures of celebrities and politicians he had known_or things like that or had\npants on or whatever, but yeah, there was a lot of mixed photographs in the outside ones.\n\nJS: | Were there any photographs of girls or young women that you knew or that you\nsubsequently came to know that you saw in the house?\n\nV: Yeah, yeah, there was. There was pictures of Nadia Bjournik ,» pictures\nSarah Keller, pictures Emmy, pictures of me, pictures of the regulars, but a lot of the\ngirls, sometimes Jeffrey could have like 7 girls a day, and he would only see those girls\nonce if he got bored. I don’t know. These weren’t my days. I heard he’s gotten a lot\nsloppier since I left. So, I don’t know anyways, but when I knew him, there was just a, it\nseemed, there was such an influx of girls coming in and out, so did I recognize a lot of\nthem? Maybe, maybe not, but then they were all definitely beautiful, they were all\nranging in age, some of them young, some of them older in their 20’s, I mean it was just\nthey were all beautiful.\n\nJS: | You’ve told us about the first visit.

Everything in my upbringing and education led\nme to the defense of freedom of speech. I was always a dissident—though they used the less\npolite term “trouble-maker.” I argued with everyone, all the time. I defended other trouble-\nmakers. I questioned everything and everybody. I may have had a Fifth Amendment right to\n“remain silent,” but I rarely exercised it. I spoke up. For me, the freedom to speak, to write, to\ndissent, to seek a redress of grievances, to assemble, to doubt, to challenge, has always been\ncentral not only to democratic governance but to life itself. The First Amendment has always\nbeen my favorite part of the Constitution, not because it is first among the Amendments—in its\noriginal, proposed form, it was the Third Amendment*>—but because without its protection, all\nother rights are in danger.\n\nNot everyone agrees. Listen to Charlton Heston: “I say that the Second Amendment is, in order\nof importance, the first amendment. It is America's First Freedom, the one right that protects all\nthe others. Among freedom of speech, of the press, of religion, of assembly, of redress of\ngrievances, it is the first among equals. It alone offers the absolute capacity to live without fear.\nThe right to keep and bear arms is the one right that allows 'rights' to exist at all.”\n\nBoth history and geography have proved Heston wrong: Nearly every other freedom loving\ncountry in the world has severe restrictions on gun ownership; while none has severe restrictions\non expression.\n\n4\n\nThe stirring words of the First Amendment—“Congress shall make no law...abridging the\nfreedom of speech or of the press...”—haven’t been amended between my first case defending\nfreedom of expression in the 1960s and my most recent one, but the meaning of these words has\nundergone dramatic transformation over the past half century. The major reason has been the\nrapid change in the manner by which speech is transmitted. Technology has altered the sound and\nlook of freedom of expression.\n\nOver the past 50 years I have defended every means, manner and mode of expression from films\nto plays, books, magazines, newspapers, photographs, leaflets, pamphlets, megaphones, websites,\ninternet postings, speeches, heckling, cartoons, faxes, composites, noises, threats, incitements,\nvideos, ads, prayers, classes, live and filmed nudity (frontal, sideal, backal), defamation,\nblasphemy, and digital communication (by which I mean a raised middle finger).\n\nI have defended right wing Neo Nazi and racist speech, hard left Stalinist rhetoric, soft core\nerotica, hard core pornography, nude photographs of children and disgusting videos of bestiality.\nI have defended the right of major newspapers and book publishers, as well as anonymous and not-\n\n°> Congress originally voted to submit 12 Amendments to be ratified by the States.

I said, ‘I could give you some\nbooks, but you wouldn’t understand them.” Nan laughed. The iron spike. “This can’t\nbe understood by reading!” Nan was trying to educate his students in the original\nprinciples of Ch’an: a set of psychological and physical tools to reveal deeper\npatterns in the world.\n\n4,\n\nAfter wearing his guests down with relentless dinner-time questioning that first\nnight | was at Lake Tai, Master Nan began to offer his views of our age. What he saw,\nhe explained, was a world pressing too hard on a fault line. We faced, he said,\nchoosing his word carefully, an “ephocal” quake. We were at a moment when the\nriver of change he had spent a lifetime feeling out was about to shift its course over\nthe landscape, drowning many of the reliable, old routes. The origins of this change\nwere buried in the very things we hoped might, in fact, save us from shock: money,\ninformation, speed. “People are now constantly connected to computers and\nmachines, and this is changing the way they think. People just cannot make sense of\nwhat is happening,” he said. “There is no respite. The world is going to go faster and\nfaster in this regard.”\n\n“In the 19 century the biggest threat to humanity was pneumonia,” he continued.\n“In the 20 century it was cancer. The illness that will mark our era, and particularly\nthe start of the 215t century, is insanity. Or we can say, spiritual disease.” He paused.\n“This next century is going to be especially turbulent. It has already begun. And\nwhen I say insanity and spiritual disease, I don’t only mean inside the minds of\nindividuals. Politics, military, economics, education, culture and medicine - all these\nwill be affected.”\n\nI could sense the logic behind Master Nan’s argument. The industrialization and\nurbanization of the 19 century had packed much of the world into Dickensian\nurban pits. These became petri dishes for pneumonia. Too much industry and\nurbanization, too fast. The 20‘ century of plastics and artificial, untested, unsafe\nmaterials had torn away at our genetic base and worsened cancers. Too much\nscience, too fast. In our age, in the 215t century he felt a wasting disease would be\ncarried by information, by cell phones, by packets of data, by every bitstream we\njacked into our lives - and it would go right for our brains. Our institutions and our\nideas about power and stability would fall apart. The remapping of force that the\ninformation revolution represented was a profound, destructive shift - what Nan\ncalled a jieshu, the Chinese word for a rupture in the fabric of human history. In such\nan era, the once reliable old habits would become useless, even dangerous. All that\nwould matter were your instincts. Frankly, all you would have would be your\ninstincts because no existing map could guide you through a completely new\nlandscape. In fact, the existing maps, should you stubbornly continue to use them,\nwould lead you along dangerous paths towards catastrophes you could not even\nimagine.\n\n10\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_018242\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

Yet with other ministers convinced that would\nmake things worse, I held off doing anything else until there seemed to me no\nchoice, after Talansky gave evidence in Jerusalem’s District Court. Though he\ngenuinely seemed not to have expected anything specific in return, he said he had\ngiven Olmert something like $150,000 in cash. I called a news conference the next\nday. I didn’t say whether or not I thought Olmert was guilty. I did say that I\nbelieved he couldn’t continue leading the country while resolving his “personal\nmatters”. Things finally came to ahead in September 2008. When Kadima held\nfresh leadership elections, Tzipi Livni won. Olmert confirmed he would step aside\nfor his successor. But under Israeli law, he would remain Prime Minister until she\neither succeeded in forming a new government or called early elections. She opted\nin the end for Option B, and the election was set for February 2009.\n\nThat meant Olmert would still be Prime Minister for another three months.\nWe’d long been discussing the increasingly worrying situation in Gaza.

Arms smuggling through tunnels\nfrom the Sinai had become rife. Rockets from Gaza were now landing on southern\nIsrael. Hundreds of thousands of Israelis were living with the reality of a warning\nsiren and a rapid dash into their shelters. For a while, amid negotiations through\nEgypt to end the rocket fire, we limited ourselves to sending small ground units\ninto Gaza to target the source of specific rocket attacks. But that was always going\nto have only a limited effect. It also ran the risk of our soldiers being abducted, or\nkilled.\n\nPressure was building for a major military operation. With the election drawing\nnearer, Bibi Netanyahu was reminding voters that he’d been against the pullout\nfrom Gaza, and saying that we should now hit Hamas hard. Both Olmert and Tzipi,\nalong with most of the cabinet, were also in favor of doing so. But my long-held\nview, reinforced by the recent war against Hizbollah in Lebanon, was that we had\nto begin by deciding what we wanted to accomplish, and what was possible.

And neither China nor India is a major buyer of American-made goods and\nservices; for the most part, it's the other way around. With much of the developed world trailing the United States, it will take\nAmerican consumers to ratchet up demand for the world's products. Scary thought.\n\nHow to tell when a real recovery begins.?\n4 Ways to Tell When a Real Recovery Has Begun\n\nYou could conclude just about anything from the daily cavalcade of economic statistics. Some suggest an imminent recovery. Others\nseem to foretell years of gloom. The bent of the expert interpreting the latest news—bull, bear, Obama-basher, Wall Street-hater—\nhas as much to do with the outlook as the numbers themselves.\n\nFor the foreseeable future, there will be an aggressive hunt for two economic recoveries. One is the technical improvement in\neconomic indicators that signals the economy is growing again. That's the one economists care about, which is why they scour the\nnumbers on retail sales, business inventories, purchasing manager sentiment, subatomic inflation, the mood in Shanghai, and\nanything else that could help pinpoint the exact inflection point for a turnaround.\n\nThe other recovery, the one that most consumers are waiting for, is the one in which companies stop firing and start hiring, banks\nreturn to normal lending, and families stop worrying about jobs and income. And that turnaround—the consumer recovery—is likely\nto take much longer to materialize than the technical recovery.\n\nThe danger of hyping a technical recovery is that it will arrive, with much fanfare—but fail to make ordinary consumers feel better\noff. Many economists, for example, are predicting that the recession will officially end by this summer or fall. The only problem is\nthat when a technical recovery begins, a lot of companies fail to get the memo. They don't play along; they keep payrolls lean and\nmaybe even continuing to lay off workers. So to guard against false optimism, here's how to tell when a real recovery is finally\nkicking into gear:\n\nUnemployment improves. The single best indicator of the health of the economy is the job market. People who have lost their job, or\nworry that they might, obviously hoard their money and don't spend. That spells doom for an economy driven by consumer spending,\nas ours is. But once it's clear that jobs are coming back, consumers are more likely to relax and open their wallets.\n\nProjections about unemployment should make anybody queasy about the prospects for a recovery this year. The unemployment rate\nis currently 9.4 percent, a steep rise from one year ago, when it was an unremarkable 5.5 percent. And by most accounts, it's going to\nget worse. The International Monetary Fund expects the U.S. unemployment rate to be 10.1 percent in 2010. Economist Gary\nShilling thinks unemployment will hit 11.4 percent and not peak until late next year.\n\nIt's hard to imagine a \"recovery\" in which jobs are even more scarce than they are now. When the unemployment rate finally starts to\ngo in the other direction, we can start to think about putting the umbrellas away. Until then, no number of upticks or volume of\noptimistic talk will persuade Americans worried about their jobs that they should part with precious cash.\n\nHousing prices stabilize. This has become a mantra by now: For the economy to get healthy, housing prices must stop falling.\nProblem is, the houses haven't been listening.\n\nHousing matters for two reasons: It represents a big chunk of the economy, and it's the largest single repository of Americans'\n\nhousehold wealth. With prices falling, buyers are scarce, since nobody wants to buy an expensive good today if it's going to be worth\nless tomorrow. With few buyers, all the other economic activity that swirls around real estate—remodeling, appliance and furniture\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_021232\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

On the\nother hand, the power of this both basic and applied mathematical orientation and\nmethod lies in its approach to the qualitative understanding of variously induced\nglobal and sudden changes in an energy-equivalent observable in biological,\npsychological, spiritual and social systems, fields of study in which little abstract and\nformal lawfulness presently exists. Oxford’s Chris Zeeman’s more accessible\napplications of Thom’s deeper, more generally ramifying, almost mystical (due to\ntheir apparent wide generality) results, include approaches to real world problems\nsuch those above as well as the sudden change in excitable membrane potential\naccompanying the generation of the heart beat and neuronal discharge;\nmechanisms of opinion change, stock market crashes and, as noted above, the\nsocial science of riots. Whereas Thom’s On Structural Stability and Morphogenesis\ncan be said to be scriptural, Zeeman’s Selected Papers, 1972-1977 constitute the\nBook of Common Prayer of this church.\n\nTo review and place catastrophe and bifurcation theories in the context of the\ndifferential equations of mathematical physics and biology, causal determinism\nimplied by differential equations conventionally requires continuity and smoothness\nin behavior to be credible. Our intuitions as well as the formal conditions for the\ngeneric differential equations of mathematics and physics imply that smoothly\nincreasing amounts of cause lead to smoothly increasing results and yield at least\n\nlocal predictability: a little more leads to a little more, a little less leads to a little less.\n\n58\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_013558\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

Kelner \nCovington & Burling LLP \nOne CityCenter \n850 Tenth Street, NW \nWashington, DC 20001-4956 \nMay 22, 2017 \nRe: Subpoena to Lieutenant General Michael T. Flynn (Ret.) \nDear Chairman Burr and Vice Chairman Warner: \nWe write in response to the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence's subpoena dated \nMay 10, 2017, requesting that our client, Lieutenant General Michael T. Flynn (Ret.), produce \nany documents he may have that are responsive to a broad range of requests covering an 18-\nmonth period of time. Specifically, the subpoena requests that he create a list of all meetings and \nall communications between himself and Russian officials, and that he produce records of all \ncommunications between himself and President Trump's campaign that were in any way related \nto Russia, for the period from June 16, 2015, to January 20, 2017. \nIn our May 8, 2017, letter to the Committee, we reiterated General Flynn's eagerness to \ngive a full account of the facts and to answer the Committee's questions, should the \ncircumstances permit, including assurances against unfair prosecution. We stated that, absent \nsuch assurances, General Flynn would respectfully decline your request for an interview and for \nthe production of documents. \nOur client's position remains unchanged. Producing documents that fall within the \nsubpoena's broad scope would be a testimonial act, insofar as it would confirm or deny the \nexistence of such documents. Under the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution and \napplicable court precedents, no person is required to offer testimony when he has \"reasonable \ncause to apprehend danger from a direct answer,\" even when that person is entirely innocent \nand has committed no crime.1 Indeed, the United States Supreme Court has \"emphasized that \none of the Fifth Amendment's basic functions... is to protect innocent men . . . who otherwise \nmight be ensnared by ambiguous circumstances.\"2 The Court held that even \"truthful responses \nof an innocent witness\" may provide the Government with evidence that could be used against \nI See Ohio v. Reiner, 532 U.S. 17, 21 (2001) (internal quotation marks omitted). \n2 Id. (emphasis in original) (internal quotation marks omitted). \nDC: 6427118-1 \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 031670 \nCOVINGTON \nThe Honorable Richard Burr \nThe Honorable Mark R. Warner \nMay 22, 2017 \nPage 2 \nthe witness. 3 And, as courts have repeatedly held, the protection offered by the Fifth \nAmendment privilege extends to producing documents where the act of production itself is \ntestimonial in nature. \nThe context in which the Committee has called for General Flynn's testimonial \nproduction of documents makes clear that he has more than a reasonable apprehension that any \ntestimony he provides could be used against him. Multiple Members of Congress have \ndemanded that he be investigated and even prosecuted. He is the target on nearly a daily basis of \noutrageous allegations, often attributed to anonymous sources in Congress or elsewhere in the \nUnited States Government, which, however fanciful on their face and unsubstantiated by \nevidence, feed the escalating public frenzy against him.4 Additionally, in the intervening time \nsince the Committee issued its subpoena, the Department of Justice has appointed a special \ncounsel to investigate these and related matters. This environment creates a \"reasonable cause \nto apprehend danger,\" giving rise to a constitutional right not to testify. A detailed explanation \nof the legal basis for respectfully declining to comply with the Committee's requests follows \nbelow.5 \nThe Fifth Amendment Privilege Bars Congress From Compelling A Witness to Provide \nTestimony Through The Act of Producing Documents  \nThe Fifth Amendment protects an individual from being \"compelled in any criminal case \nto be a witness against himself.\" U.S. Const. amend. V. This privilege applies in congressional \ninvestigations. In Watkins v. United States, Chief Justice Warren stressed that \"the \nconstitutional rights of witnesses will be respected by the Congress as they are in a court of \njustice.... Witnesses cannot be compelled to give evidence against themselves.\" 354 U.S. 178, \n187-88 (1957). The Supreme Court later held in United States v. Hubbell, 530 U.S. 27,34 \n(200o), that the right not to be compelled to give testimony against oneself applies as well to the \ncompelled production of documents that would be \"testimonial\" in nature. Specifically, the act \nof producing documents in response to a subpoena may have a \"compelled testimonial aspect\" \nwhen \"the act of production itself may implicitly communicate statements of fact\" that the \ndocuments \"existed, were in his possession or control, and were authentic.\" Id. at 36 (internal \nquotation marks omitted) (quoting United States v. Doe, 465 U.S. 605,613 & n.11 (1984)). \n3 Id. \n4 These include leaks that purport to describe classified briefings, documents, and intelligence \ncollection. Any actual leaks of classified information -- including reported leaks of signals \nintelligence -- constitute criminal offenses by government officials violating their duty to protect \nclassified information. \n5 General Flynn reserves the right to assert, in connection with the subpoena, any other privilege \nor protection provided by the Constitution, statute, or common law. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 031671 \nCOVINGTON \nThe Honorable Richard Burr \nThe Honorable Mark R. Warner \nMay 22, 2017 \nPage 3 \nA. If the government fails to demonstrate prior knowledge of requested \nsubpoenaed documents, the act of producing those documents is testimonial. \nTwo Supreme Court precedents, Fisher v. United States, 425 U.S. 391 (1976) and United \nStates v. Hubbell, as well as Hubbell's progeny, United States v. Ponds, 454 F.3d 313 (D.C. Cir. \n2oo6), inform the determination of whether a production of documents in response to a \nsubpoena has a testimonial character. Fisher involved IRS investigations in which the \ngovernment learned that the investigated taxpayers had given their attorneys tax returns \nprepared by their accountants in the years in question. The Court highlighted that the \nsubpoenaed documents belonged to the accountant and not the target of the investigation, were \nprepared by the accountant, and are \"the kind usually prepared by an accountant working on the \ntax returns of his client.\" Fisher, 425 U.S. at 411. The Court concluded that insofar as the \ngovernment was not relying on the taxpayer to prove the existence of the documents, production \nof the documents was not \"testimonial\" because \"the existence and location of the papers are a \nforegone conclusion and the taxpayer adds little or nothing to the sum total of the Government's \ninformation by conceding that he in fact has the papers.\" Id. \nIn contrast to Fisher, a case in which investigators already knew that documents existed \nand exactly where they were located, the investigators in Hubbell lacked \"any prior knowledge of \neither the existence or the whereabouts\" of the subpoenaed materials. Hubbell, 530 U.S. 27, 44-\n45. Hubbell arose out of the Whitewater investigation, in which Independent Counsel Kenneth \nStarr sought broad categories of information from Webster Hubbell, a target of the \ninvestigation. The subpoena included such requests as \"any and all documents reflecting, \nreferring, or relating to\" the broad contours of the investigation, as well as \"Hubbell's schedule \nof activities.\" Id. at 41, 47. In examining the broad requests in the subpoena, the Court \nemphasized that \"it [was] apparent from the text of the subpoena itself that the prosecutor \nneeded respondent's assistance both to identify potential sources of information and to produce \nthose sources.\" Id. at 41. The Court ruled that the acts required to respond to such a broad \nsubpoena were testimonial in nature, comparing them to \"answering a series of interrogatories \nasking a witness to disclose the existence and location of particular documents fitting certain \nbroad descriptions.\" Id. at 41, 43. \nThe U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit applied Hubbell and \nFisher in United States v. Ponds, framing the inquiry as concerning \"an act of production that, \nin its testimonial character, falls somewhere between the response to a fishing expedition \naddressed in United States v. Hubbell, and the production of documents whose existence was a \n'foregone conclusion' in Fisher v. United States.\" United States v. Ponds, 454 F.3d 313, 316 \n(D.C. Cir. 2oo6). The court emphasized that \"[w]hether an act of production is sufficiently \ntestimonial to implicate the Fifth Amendment ... depends on the government's knowledge \nregarding the documents before they are produced.\" Id. at 320. Significantly, the Ponds court \nput the burden on the government to show that the act of production would not be testimonial, \nrequiring the government to show its pre-subpoena knowledge of the \"existence, possession, and \nauthenticity of the subpoenaed documents with reasonable particularity such that the \ncommunication inherent in the act of production can be considered a foregone conclusion.\" Id. \nat 324 (internal citations omitted). \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 031672 \nCOVI NGTON \nThe Honorable Richard Burr \nThe Honorable Mark R. Warner \nMay 22, 2017 \nPage 4 \nThe court contrasted the concept of \"reasonable particularity\" with mere general \nknowledge of an event or topic, finding that mere \"prior knowledge [of a topic] ... cannot suffice \nto establish [the government's] prior knowledge of the existence and location of the documents \nrelating or referring to those topics.\" Id. at 326. Ultimately, the court held that \"[b]ecause the \ngovernment has failed to show with reasonable particularity that it knew of the existence and \nlocation of most of the subpoenaed documents... Ponds' act of production was sufficiently \ntestimonial to implicate his right against self-incrimination under the Fifth Amendment to the \nConstitution.\" Id. at 316. \nB. Because the Committee's subpoena fails to demonstrate with reasonable \nparticularity prior knowledge of the requested documents, General Flynn's act \nof production would be testimonial in nature. \nThe great breadth of the Committee's subpoena to General Flynn suggests that his act of \nproducing the requested documents, if they even exist, would be testimonial in nature, given \nthat the Committee has not demonstrated knowledge of the \"existence, possession, and \nauthenticity of the subpoenaed documents with reasonable particularity such that the \ncommunication inherent in the act of production can be considered a foregone conclusion.\" Id. \nat 324. Schedule A of the subpoena requests production of: \n1. A list of all meetings between you and any Russian official or \nrepresentative of Russian business interests which took place \nbetween June 16, 2015, and 12pm on January 20, 2017. For each \nmeeting listed, please include the date, location, all individuals \npresent, and complete copies of any notes taken by you or on your \nbehalf. \n2. All communications records, including electronic \ncommunications records such as e-mail or text messages, written \ncorrespondence, and phone records, of communications that took \nplace between June 16, 2015, and 12pm on January zo 2017, to \nwhich you and any Russian official or representative of Russian \nbusiness interests was a party. \n3. All communications records, including electronic \ncommunications records such as e-mail or text message, written \ncorrespondence, and phone records, of communications related in \nany way to Russia, conducted between you and members and \nadvisors of the Trump campaign prior to izpm on January 20, \n2017. \nIn sum, the subpoena demands a list of \"all meetings\" with \"any Russian official,\" \"all \ncommunication records\" with \"any Russian official,\" and \"all communication records ... related \nin any way to Russia\" conducted with unnamed \"members and advisors of the Trump \ncampaign,\" that occurred over an 18-month period. The broad sweep and lack of specificity of \nthese demands clearly reflect that the Committee does not have specific knowledge regarding \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 031673 \nCOVI NGTON \nThe Honorable Richard Burr \nThe Honorable Mark R. Warner \nMay 22, 2017 \nPage 5 \nthe existence of any particular responsive documents. See United States v. Doe, 465 U.S. 605, \n613 n.12 (1984) (\"The most plausible inference to be drawn from the broad-sweeping subpoenas \nis that the Government [is] unable to prove that the subpoenaed documents exist . ...\"). \nThe first demand for a list of all meetings with any Russian official (or \"representative of \nRussian business interests\") over 18 months fails for want of specifying particular individuals, \nlocations, or dates. Moreover, this is not merely a demand to produce existing documents. It is \nactually an interrogatory demanding that General Flynn create a new document containing \ninformation that the Committee seeks to discover. This is a demand for direct testimony, not \nmerely a testimonial act of production. As in Hubbell, General Flynn's compilation of such a list \nwould be akin to him \"answering a series of interrogatories asking [him] to disclose the \nexistence and location of [meetings] fitting certain broad descriptions.\" Hubbell, 530 U.S. at 41. \nThe Court in Hubbell held that the witness could not be compelled to prepare such a list without \nviolating his Fifth Amendment privilege. Finally, the nebulous term \"representative of Russian \nbusiness interests\" necessarily would require General Flynn, in responding to the request, to \ntestify as to who is or is not a \"representative of Russian business interests.\" This too constitutes \ndirect testimony that is clearly covered by the Fifth Amendment privilege. \nThe subpoena's second and third demands are even broader in scope than the first, given \ntheir request for all communication records with any Russian official. The complete lack of \nspecificity in the request makes clear that, unlike in Fisher, the existence of any document \nresponsive to the Committee's request is far from a \"foregone conclusion.\" Fisher, 425 U.S. at \n411. The fact that the subpoena also demands all documents in the custody, control or \npossession of General Flynn's \"agents, employees, or representatives\" underscores that the \nCommittee does not know whether responsive documents exist, who may possess them, or \nwhere they are located. Were General Flynn to provide responsive documents, he would be \nproviding compelled testimony about \"the documents' existence, custody, and authenticity.\" \nHubbell, 530 U.S. at 28. This is precisely the sort of testimonial information that the Fifth \nAmendment privilege is designed to protect from compelled disclosure. See In re Grand Jury \nSubpoena, Dated Apr. 18, 200,3,383 F.3d 905, 911 (9th Cir. 2004) (finding an act of production \nto be testimonial in nature where a \"subpoena seeks all documents within a category but fails to \ndescribe those documents with any specificity. .\"). \nThe Committee must demonstrate more than general knowledge that a meeting may \nhave occurred; the Committee must demonstrate \"knowledge of the existence and possession of \nthe actual documents\" in order to prove that the existence and location of the documents is a \n\"foregone conclusion.\" Id. at 910 (emphasis added). The Committee simply has not met its \nburden of showing its \"pre-subpoena knowledge of the existence, possession, and authenticity of \nthe subpoenaed documents with reasonable particularity.\" Ponds, 454 F.3d at 324. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 031674 \nCOVINGTON \nThe Honorable Richard Burr \nThe Honorable Mark R. Warner \nMay 22, 2017 \nPage 6 \nInstead, as in Hubbell, the Committee's broad demands makes it \"apparent from the text \nof the subpoena itself' that the Committee needs General Flynn's \"assistance both to identify \npotential sources of information and to produce those sources.\" Hubbell, 530 U.S. at 41. As a \nconsequence, the subpoena seeks to compel General Flynn to offer testimony through the act of \nproducing documents that may or may not exist. In these circumstances, General Flynn is \nentitled to, and does, invoke his Fifth Amendment privilege against production of documents. \nRespectfully submitted, \nRobert K. Kelner \nStephen P.

But I\nstill had no doubt at all that this amounted to a witch-hunt.\n\nMoshe still said nothing. “I have no idea whether Dan is or is not a\nhomosexual. After knowing him for years, I have no reason at all to believe that\nhe is. But let’s assume, for a moment, that he is,” I said. He’s not some junior\nlieutenant... This is a man who has risked his life for Israel. Repeatedly. Under\nfire.” Then, I got to the real issue. “I hesitate to mention this,” I said, realizing,\nand in a way hoping, that my tone would sound vaguely threatening. “But if you\norder this, the very fact of doing so might be interpreted as being a result of\nsome other motives on your part. I’m doing my best to convince you to think\nagain. But I want you to know that if I can’t, ’'m going from here to Misha’s\noffice. I'll try to convince him of the damage from what you’re contemplating to\nthe whole fabric of trust in the general staff and the army, to the image of the\narmy.” Still, he said nothing. He nodded occasionally. He puffed on his\ncigarette, put it out, lit another one. It was pretty clear he had no intention of\nrescinding his order.\n\nWithin 20 minutes, was in the Minister of Defense’s office. I spoke to him for\nabout 10 minutes. Misha listened. At the end, he said: “I understand what you’ve\ntold me.” I never discovered what exactly he said to Moshe Vechetzi. But the\ninvestigation never happened. I never spoke a word about any of it to Dan until\nyears later, after both of us had left the army.\n\nThe result, however, was that Dan became deputy chief-of-staff under\nMoshe, the latest step in what was beginning to look like a steady rise to the top.\nBut Misha did make a few concessions to Moshe’s preferred candidates, and that\nnow turned out to have major implications for me. It was a long-accepted\npractice that chiefs-of-staff had more than one deputy during their period in\ncharge. In the homestretch of Moshe’s tenure, he was able to bring in Amir Drori\nfor a spell as his number-two. And early in 1986, he also brought Amnon Lipkin\nback to the kirya. Amnon was given my job, as Director of Intelligence. But I got\nthe post which Amnon was leaving: head of the central command area. This\nmeant that, for the first time, I would be in charge of one of Israel’s three regional\nmilitary commands, and we were based on the edge of Jerusalem, with security\nresponsibility for the West Bank.\n\nThis was my first direct exposure to the combustible mix of restive\nPalestinians and the growing number of Jewish settlers. Our main brief was to\nprevent terror attacks, violence or unrest from the roughly 850,000 West Bank\n\n220\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_011691\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

How do\nexpectations change reality?\n\nTo answer this question, my colleague, cognitive neuroscientist Sara\nBengtsson, devised an experiment in which she manipulated positive\nand negative expectations of students while their brains were scanned\nand tested their performance on cognitive tasks. To induce\nexpectations of success, she primed college students with words such\nas smart, intelligent and clever just before asking them to perform a\ntest. To induce expectations of failure, she primed them with words\nlike stupid and ignorant. The students performed better after being\nprimed with an affirmative message.\n\nExamining the brain-imaging data, Bengtsson found that the students\nbrains responded differently to the mistakes they made depending on\nwhether they were primed with the word clever or the word stupid.\nWhen the mistake followed positive words, she observed enhanced\nactivity in the anterior medial part of the prefrontal cortex (a region\nthat is involved in self-reflection and recollection). However, when\nthe participants were primed with the word stupid, there was no\nheightened activity after a wrong answer. It appears that after being\nprimed with the word stupid, the brain expected to do poorly and did\nnot show signs of surprise or conflict when it made an error. A brain\nthat doesn't expect good results lacks a signal telling it, \"Take notice —\nwrong answer!\" These brains will fail to learn from their mistakes and\nare less likely to improve over time.

Not only did I feel that would be wrong, as long as\nthere was a scintilla of hope. I believed that our continued diplomatic engagement\nmight provide a counterweight to any moves by Arafat to revert to violence. It was\nalso critical for Israel to retain the diplomatic, political and moral high ground we\nhad earned in the eyes of the international community from the concessions we had\nbeen willing to consider. When the President suggested drafting a final American\npaper, based on Camp David though presumably with an even more generous\nproposal for the Palestinians, I agreed. I figured even Arafat might realize at some\npoint that if he did want a negotiated peace, the time for dithering was over.\nClinton would no longer be president in five months’ time. Unless I could find an\nalternative way to refortify my coalition over the coming weeks, it was entirely\npossible I’d have to form a “unity” coalition with Ank and the Likud. Still, I told\nPresident Clinton I doubted the ticking clock would make a difference to the\nPalestinian leader. If it didn’t, I believed at some point all our talk about an “end of\nconflict” would give way to conflict. The only question was when.\n\nTragically, I got the answer only weeks after my return from the UN.\n\nAt the urging of the Americans, I invited Arafat and his negotiating team to a\nprivate dinner in Kochav Yair on the 25th of September. The atmosphere was\nsurprisingly warm, for which a lot of the credit, as well as culinary praise, has to go\nto Nava. “Very cordial, even congenial,” Nabil Shaath told reporters after the\ndinner, nearly 45 minutes of which I spent talking alone with Arafat on the stone\nterrace out back. Each of us spoke to Clinton for about 10 minutes near the end,\nand the President was obviously pleased to hear us sounding upbeat about trying to\nnarrow any differences on the forthcoming American negotiating paper. On the\nsubstance of our differences, by mutual agreement, Arafat and I didn’t say much to\neach other. I did try to impress on him that time was getting short. His\nmonosyllabic reply — yes — was at least better than the alternative. I chose to\nbelieve we could both now focus on trying again.\n\n378\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_011849\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

US shale gas production is up 14-fold over the\nlast decade, and the EIA projects that by 2035, the US will no longer be a gas importer. Yes, the Energy Department recently\nslashed estimates of gas in the Marcellus Basin from 410 trillion cubic feet to 84 trillion; this followed the latest survey by the\nUS Geological Survey, which last estimated the basin at 2 trillion cubic feet in 2002. However, the historical imprecision of\npeak oil/gas estimates make it a difficult science. To be clear, shale gas production will be critical; EIA projections to 2035\nassume that rising shale gas production will offset declines in almost every other gas category (see p. 7). Deep sea gas reserves\nare a potential positive, but marginal costs may be an issue. As for shale gas exploration and radium (naturally occurring and\nsurfaced in sometimes dangerous concentrations), and fracking chemicals themselves, the cost of natural gas electricity appears\nlow enough to absorb costs related to wastewater collection and treatment. Eventually, replacements will be needed for fossil\nfuels. What “art of the possible” solutions do is give the world more time to find them. In the meantime, many scientists\nwould prefer to put as much emphasis on efficiency as on new technologies. Examples include 95% efficient natural gas\nfurnaces, LED/fluorescent lighting and more insulation. The largest direct energy saver in a 2010 report by the Pacific\nNorthwest National Laboratory for the Department of Energy: deployment of diagnostic devices in residential and\ncommercial buildings to manage HVAC systems and lighting.\n\nA potential game-changer: electricity storage that works, in commercial scale\n\nWhat would potentially change the energy equation is storage. The world has been generating commercially available\nelectricity for over a hundred years, but as things stand now, the world has almost no electricity storage. The benefits of\nelectricity storage, if it could be implemented, are self-evident:\n\ne increased cost-effectiveness of intermittent solar and wind power, and lower electricity costs, since electricity produced by\nwind at night could be stored and sold during the day; and electricity produced during sunny days could be stored and sold\nduring cloudy spells. There are obvious tie-ins to the feasibility and cost of electric cars\n\ne lower required peak production capacities of large urban power systems, by drawing on stored electricity reserves\n\ne deferral or avoidance of costly upgrades to the transmission grid. As per the North American Electricity Reliability\nCorporation, only 27% of grid upgrades relate to integrating renewable energy. Almost half are designed to improve overall\nreliability, due to fluctuating loads (since the grid has to accommodate peak loads, and not just average ones)\n\ne reduced consumption of fossil fuels which power most stand-by generators\n\nUnfortunately, battery storage has moved along at a snail’s pace. Moore’s Law on doubling semiconductor capacity is\nsomething of a distraction; technology improvements over 15-18 months are hard to find anywhere EXCEPT semiconductors.\nSolar photovoltaic cell efficiency has doubled over 15-18 years; and battery storage has progressed even more slowly as it\nrelates to commercial-scale applications’ (rather than lithium ion applications for cell phone and laptops). As a reminder,\nelectricity is simply defined as the movement of electrons, which can only be “stored” as potential energy, for example via large\nheight or chemical gradients (e.g., batteries).\n\nCompressed Air Energy\nStorage, 440 MW\n\nSodium-Sulfur Battery\n\nThe accompanying chart shows the existing state of\ncommercial-scale electricity storage; it’s all about\n\npumped hydro”, a process that uses cheaper electricity at 316 MW\nnight to pump water uphill into a reservoir basin, and then @ Lead-Acid Battery\nreleases the water during the day to power a hydro-electric ~35 MW\n\ngenerator. The other technologies are an afterthought, at\nleast right now. Note that more energy is expended in\npumping the energy uphill than is generated by releasing it\n\n@ Nickel-Cadmium\nBattery, 27 MW\n\nFlywheels\ndownhill; the economic value derives from much higher <25 MW\nelectricity prices during the day. Around 10%-20% of the Lithium-ion Battery\npotential pumped hydro energy is lost over time through ~20 MW\nevaporation and conversion losses. Reson flow Battery\n\nSource: Fraunhofer Institute, EPRI, Electricity Storage Technology Options, 2010.\n\n° Companies like A123 produce commercial scale batteries, but they are primarily for grid-smoothing. A123’s lithium ion batteries are meant\nto store energy for fractions of an hour, rather than for hours or days.\n\n© Most pumped hydro facilities are designed to run for 10 hours uninterrupted (before being empty). Assuming 127 GW of installed\ncapacity, that means that 1,270 GWh of electricity would be produced before their reservoirs ran dry. That amount of stored electricity is\n0.0064% of annual global generation. That is a very small supply; inventory storage for crude oil is 10%-12% of annual production.\n\n5\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_030818\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

Although OLC’s memorandum characterizes Turner as excluding victims of uncharged conduct, 1°\n\nthe magistrate\njudge adopted an inclusive reading of the statute precisely because of his reservations about the CVRA's legislative history and\nplain language. The judge suggested that \"any person who self-identifies as [a victim]\" could be presumed to qualify for\nprotection under the CVRA as a preliminary matter. !°° In fact, the line quoted by the Department is lifted out of context. The\nfull sentence reads: \"While the offense charged against a defendant can [*79] serve as a basis for identifying a \"crime victim'\nas defined in the CVRA, the class of victims with statutory rights may well be broader.\" !°7\n\nPaletz and Skinner similarly provide scant support for the Department's position. In Skinner, a prison inmate attempted to bring\na pro se civil suit against another inmate for allegedly attacking him during incarceration. !°° In dismissing the suit in an\nunpublished decision, the district court recognized that the Government had expressly declined to bring charges against the\nother inmate and concluded that the CVRA did not create a \"mechanism to bring an action against Defendant directly.\" 1°? In\nPaletz, that same inmate brought a similar pro se claim against another inmate, the Federal Bureau of Prisons, the FBI, and the\nU.S. Attorney General. !!° In a parallel, unpublished decision, the district court dismissed the suit, noting that the CVRA is\ndesigned to give victims certain rights \"within the prosecutorial process against a criminal defendant.\" 11!\n\nBecause Skinner and Paletz involve (apparently frivolous) civil suits, they say nothing about the CVRA's reach in criminal\ncases, and any language to that effect would be pure dicta. Moreover, the courts' terse analysis in both cases does not contain\nany substantive discussion of whether CVRA rights apply in criminal cases before the filing of charges. Instead, the courts\nsimply cited to language from a Second Circuit decision that stated that the CVRA does not give victims any rights against\ndefendants until those defendants have been convicted !!* - a holding clearly limited to restitution, as many other CVRA rights\nclearly apply before conviction. !!3 Reviewing these two cases in an extended, published opinion, the U.S. District Court for\nthe Southern District of Texas noted that reading these two decisions as standing for the proposition that charges must be filed\nfor CVRA rights to attach \"appears inconsistent with the CVRA recognition of certain subsection (a) rights that apply during\ninvestigation, before any charging instrument is filed.\" '!4 As a result, OLC [*80] vastly overstates its position when it asserts\n\n3 No. 6:07-1389-GRA-WMC, 2007 WL 1875802 (D.S.C.

The fact that\nmany churches, as well as conservative and reform Judaism, support equality has muted the\nimpact of the religious right somewhat on this issue. Before long, I predict, it will not be an issue\nfor most Americans.\n\nIn 2003, during the beginning of the presidential election season, the Supreme Judicial Court of\nMassachusetts rendered the first-in-the-nation decision declaring it unconstitutional to limit\nmarriage to heterosexual couples. This decision was truly a knife that cut both ways: it was a\nMagna Carta for gay and lesbian couples, but it was also a boon to social conservative candidates\nwho could use it as an important part of their appeal to the majority of Americans who then\nbelieved that marriage should be reserved for heterosexual couples.\n\nI decided to write an op ed that would seek to eliminate gay marriage as “a wedge issue” in the\nupcoming political campaign. In it, I argued that if marriage is indeed sacreda divine, a blessed\nsacrament between man and woman as ordained in the Bible, it would follow that the entire\nconcept of marriage has no place in our civil society, which recognizes the separation between the\nsacred and the secular, between church and state. Just as the state has no role in baptisms,\ncircumcisions or other religious rituals, it should play no role in sacred marriages.\n\nThe state is, of course, concerned with the secular rights and responsibilities that are currently\nassociated with the sacrament of marriage (as it is with the safety of baptisms and circumcisions):\nthe financial consequences of divorce, the custody of children, Social Security and hospital\nbenefits, etc.\n\nThe solution I proposed is to unlink the religious institution of marriage -- as distinguished from\nthe secular institution of civil union -- from the state. Under this proposal, any couple, regardless\nof gender, could register for civil union, recognized by the state, with all its rights and\nresponsibilities.\n\nReligious couples could then go to the church, synagogue, mosque or other sacred institution of\ntheir choice in order to be married. These religious institutions would have total decision-making\nauthority over which marriages to recognize. Catholic churches would not have to perform or\nrecognize gay marriages. Orthodox Jewish synagogues would not perform or recognize a\nmarriage between a Jew and a non-Jew who did not wish to convert to Judaism. And those\nreligious institutions that chose to perform or recognize gay marriages could do so. It would be\nentirely a religious decision beyond the scope of the state.\n\nUnder this new arrangement, marriage would remain a sacrament, as ordained by the Bible and as\ninterpreted by each individual church. No secular consequences would flow from marriage, only\nfrom civil union.\n\nIn this way, gay couples would win exactly the same civil rights as heterosexual couples in\nrelationship to the state. They would still have to persuade individual churches of their point of\nview, but that is not the concern of the secular state.\n\nNot only would this solution be good for gays and for those who oppose gay marriage on\nreligious grounds, it would also strengthen the wall of separation between church and state by\n\n311\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_017398\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

The brain cells — a specialized form of nerve cell — connect to\nthe rest of the body via the nerve cells that largely run down our spine.\nThoughts trigger action and, in reverse, the nerves in our extremities\nsense things in the environment and relay information back to the\nbrain. If I think, ‘move my finger’ my finger will move, and if it touches\nsomething I will feel the sensation. Interestingly if my finger touches\nsomething hot a reflex will kick in. Reflexes work without involving the\nbrain. We don’t have to think, “that hurts” Instead, our finger reflexively\npulls away. We may say ouch, but by the time we do, our fingers already\nmoved away from the heat.\n\nNerve cells are much slower than the electronic systems we build\nwith copper and silicon. This speed is quite noticeable and limits the\nrate we can do certain things. It takes around 0.08 seconds for a nerve\nimpulse to run down to the tips of our fingers, initiate an action and\nreturn to give us the sensation of the action. This may sound fast but if\nyou're a tennis player in a rally or a pianist faced with a fast passage, the\nnerves don't have time to make a full round trip signal before the next\naction must be initiated. In these instances we need to run on autopilot\nand there are parts of the body where the nervous system takes action\nwithout the brain getting involved. This is particularly the case with\nthings like walking and balance, which must respond fast to changes in\nground conditions. The signals just don’t have time — and don’t need — to\ngo all the way up to the top of the body for instructions. Rather like the\nheat reflex above, the peripheral nervous system can process information\nlocally. After all, brain cells and nerve cells are really all one type of cell.\n\nIf you have a group of people, you can conduct a fun experiment\nto show the speed of nerves. Hold hands in a big circle and squeeze the\nhand of the person next to you. When they feel you squeeze, they should\nsqueeze the next person’s hand and so on. The rate at which people\nsqueeze hands around the circle is limited by the speed at which nerves\nconduct the signals across our bodies.\n\nImaging the Brain\n\nThere are several ways to look inside the brain without recourse to a bone\nsaw. The methods are fascinating in their own right, even before we start\nlooking at the results. Each image is generated using a different physical\nprinciple.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_015789\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

Moreover, the complex pattern of these connections is very\nmeaningful. (See our next point.) Computer units typically make only a handful\nof connections, in regular, fixed patterns.\n\ne Development (self-assembly with interactive sculpting): The human brain grows\nits units by cell divisions and orchestrates them into coherent structures by\nmovement and folding. It also proliferates an abundance of connections among\nthe cells. An important part of its sculpting occurs through active processes\nduring infancy and childhood, as the individual interacts with his or her\nenvironment. In this process, many connections are winnowed away, while others\nare strengthened, depending on their effectiveness in use. Thus, the fine structure\nof the brain is tuned through interaction with the external world—a rich source of\ninformation and feedback!\n\ne /ntegration (sensors and actuators): The human brain comes equipped with a\nvariety of sensory organs, notably including its outgrowth eyes, and with versatile\nactuators, including hands that build, legs that walk, and mouths that speak.\nThose sensors and actuators are seamlessy integrated into the brain’s information-\nprocessing centers, having been honed over millions of years of natural selection.\nWe interpret their raw signals and control their large-scale actions with minimal\nconscious attention. The flip side is that we don’t know how we do it, and the\nimplementation is opaque. It’s proving surprisingly difficult to reach human\nstandards on these “routine” input-output functions.\n\nThese advantages of human brains over currently engineered artifacts are\nprofound. Human brains supply an inspiring existence proof, showing us several ways\nwe can get more out of matter. When, if ever, will our engineering catch up?\n\nI don’t know for sure, but let me offer some informed opinions. The challenges\nof three-dimensionality and, to a lesser extent, self-repair don’t look overwhelming.\n\nThey present some tough engineering problems, but many incremental improvements are\neasy to imagine, and there are clear paths forward. And while the powers of human eyes,\nhands, and other sensory organs and actuators are wonderfully effective, their abilities are\nfar from exhausting any physical limits. Optical systems can take pictures with higher\nresolution in space, time, and color, and in more regions of the electromagnetic spectrum;\nrobots can move faster and be stronger; and so forth. In these domains, the components\nnecessary for superhuman performance, along many axes, are already available. The\nbottleneck is getting information into and out of them, rapidly, in the language of the\ninformation-processing units.\n\nAnd this brings us to the remaining, and I think most profound, advantages of\nbrains over artificial devices, which stem from their connectivity and interactive\ndevelopment. Those two advantages are synergistic, since it is interactive development\nthat sculpts the massively wired but sprawling structure of the infant brain, enabled by\nexponential growth of neurons and synapses, to get tuned into the extraordinary\ninstrument it becomes. Computer scientists are beginning to discover the power of the\nbrain’s architecture: Neural nets, whose basic design, as their name suggests, was directly\ninspired by the brain’s, have scored some spectacular successes in game playing and\npattern recognition, as noted. But present-day engineering has nothing comparable—in\n\n60\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_016280\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

(One of the few people who seem actually to\nhave taken him up on this reading assignment was Jared Kushner.) “A very moving\nexperience reading this book. It makes the world clear, amazing characters and all true,”\nBannon enthused.\n\nThis was a personal bit of branding—Bannon made sure to exhibit the book to many of\nthe liberal reporters he was courting. But he was also trying to make a point, an important\none considering the slapdash nature of the transition team’s staffing protocols: be careful\nwho you hire.\n\nHalberstam’s book, published in 1972, is a Tolstoyan effort to understand how great\nfigures of the academic, intellectual, and military world who had served during the\nKennedy and Johnson years had so grievously misapprehended the nature of the Vietnam\nWar and mishandled its prosecution. The Best and the Brightest was a cautionary tale\nabout the 1960s establishment—the precursor of the establishment that Trump and\nBannon were now so aggressively challenging.\n\nBut the book also served as a reverential guide to the establishment. For the 1970s\ngeneration of future policy experts, would-be world leaders, and Ivy League journalists\naiming for big-time careers—though it was Bannon’s generation, he was far outside this\nself-selected elite circle—The Best and the Brightest was a handbook about the\ncharacteristics of American power and the routes to it. Not just the right schools and right\nbackgrounds, although that, too, but the attitudes, conceits, affect, and language that would\nbe most conducive to finding your way into the American power structure. Many saw the\nbook as a set of prescriptions about how to get ahead, rather than, as intended, what not to\ndo when you are ahead. The Best and the Brightest described the people who should be in\npower. A college-age Barack Obama was smitten with the book, as was Rhodes Scholar\nBill Clinton.\n\nHalberstam’s book defined the look and feel of White House power. His language,\nresonant and imposing and, often, boffo pompous, had set the tone for the next half\ncentury of official presidential journalism. Even scandalous or unsuccessful tenants of the\nWhite House were treated as unique figures who had risen to the greatest heights after\nmastering a Darwinian political process. Bob Woodward, who helped bring Nixon down\n—and who himself became a figure of unchallengeable presidential mythmaking—wrote a\nlong shelf of books in which even the most misguided presidential actions seemed part of\nan epochal march of ultimate responsibility and life-and-death decision making. Only the\nmost hardhearted reader would not entertain a daydream in which he or she was not part\nof this awesome pageant.\n\nSteve Bannon was such a daydreamer.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_019924\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

In my first meeting, as a\nnewly promoted Major General, with our then Defence Minister Ariel Sharon,\nSharon turned to me and the army’s Chief of Staff, Rafael Eitan, and said: “Tell\nme. Why the hell is Arafat still alive?” He looked first at Raful, then at me, and\nadded: “When I was 20 years younger than you are, I never waited for someone\nlike Ben-Gurion or Dayan to ask me to plan an operation. I would plan it! Then\nI’d take it to them and say, you’re the politicians, you decide, but if you say yes,\nwe'll do it.” I smiled, telling him that I’d done exactly that, a decade earlier,\nonly to have one of his mates in the top brass say no. Sharon now said yes. But\nthe plan was overtaken: by his ill-fated plan to launch a full-scale invasion of\nLebanon in 1982, targeting not just Arafat, but with the aim of crushing the\nPLO militarily once and for all.\n\nI finally met Arafat face-to-face at the end of 1995. Although the Oslo peace\nprocess had dramatically changed things, it was clear that the real prize — real\npeace — was still far away. We were in Barcelona, for a Euro-Mediterranean\nmeeting under the auspices of King Juan Carlos, aimed at trying to re-invigorate\nnegotiations. The ceremonial centrepiece of the event was a dinner at one of the\nroyal palaces, and it was arranged for me and Arafat to meet for a few minutes\nbeforehand. | arrived first. I found myself in a breathtakingly opulent, but\notherwise empty, room. Empty, that is, except for a dark-brown Steinway piano.\nFrom childhood, I have loved music. And while I am never likely to threaten the\ncareer of anyone in the New York Philharmonic, I have, over the years,\ndeveloped some ability, and drawn huge enjoyment, as a classical pianist. I\npulled back the red-velvet bench and began to play. With my back to the\ndoorway, I was unaware that Arafat had arrived, and that he was soon standing\nonly a few feet away, watching as I played one of my favourite pieces, a Chopin\nwaltz. My old commando antennae must have been blunted. I may not have\nbecome “fat”. But, undeniably, I was now a politician.\n\nWhen I finally realised Arafat was behind me, I turned, embarrassed, stood\nup, and grasped his hand. “It’s a real pleasure to meet you,” I said. “I must say I\nhave spent many years watching you — by other means.” He smiled. We stood\ntalking for about 10 minutes. My hope was to establish simple, human contact;\nto signal respect; to begin to create the conditions not to try to kill Arafat, but to\nmake peace with him. “We carry a great responsibility,” I said. “Both of our\npeoples have paid a heavy price, and the time has come to find a way to solve\nthis.”\n\n7\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_011478\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

In part, this is because it’s easy to tell\nthe stories about AI and robots, and in part because of early successes (e.g., theorem\nprovers that reproduced most of Whitehead and Russell’s Principia Mathematica) and\nmassive military funding. The earlier and broader vision of cybernetics, which\nconsidered the artificial as part of larger systems of feedback and mutual influence, faded\nfrom public awareness.\n\nHowever, in the intervening years the cybernetics vision has slowly grown and\nquietly taken over—to the point where it is “in the air.” State-of-the-art research in most\nengineering disciplines is now framed as feedback systems that are dynamic and driven\nby energy flows. Even AI is being recast as human/machine “advisor” systems, and the\nmilitary is beginning large-scale funding in this area—something that should perhaps\nworry us more than drones and independent humanoid robots.\n\nBut as science and engineering have adopted a more cybernetics-like stance, it has\nbecome clear that even the vision of cybernetics is far too small. It was originally\ncentered on the embeddedness of the individual actor but not on the emergent properties\nof a network of actors. This is unsurprising, because the mathematics of networks did not\nexist until recently, so a quantitative science of how networks behave was impossible.\nWe now know that study of the individual does not produce understanding of the system\nexcept in certain simple cases. Recent progress in this area was foreshadowed by\nunderstanding that “chaos,” and later “complexity,” were the typical behavior of systems,\nbut we can now go far beyond these statistical understandings.\n\nWe’re beginning to be able to analyze, predict, and even design the emergent\nbehavior of complex heterogeneous networks. The cybernetics view of the connected\nindividual actor can now be expanded to cover complex systems of connected individuals\nand machines, and the insights we obtain from this broader view are fundamentally\ndifferent from those obtained from the cybernetics view. Thinking about the network is\nanalogous to thinking about entire ecosystems. How would you guide ecosystems to\ngrow in a good direction? What do you even mean by “a good direction”? Questions\nlike this are beyond the boundary of traditional cybernetic thinking.\n\nPerhaps the most stunning realization is that humans are already beginning to use\nAI and machine learning to guide entire ecosystems, including ecosystems of people, thus\ncreating human-AI ecologies. Now that everything is becoming “datafied,” we can\nmeasure most aspects of human life and, increasingly, aspects of all life. This, together\nwith new, powerful machine-learning techniques, means that we can build models of\nthese ecologies in ways we couldn’t before. Well-known examples are weather- and\ntraffic-prediction models, which are being extended to predict the global climate and plan\ncity growth and renewal. AlI-aided engineering of the ecologies is already here.\n\n135\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_016938\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

These materials include short form videos such as this one on Robert Pinsky’s\n“Shirt” (as featured in The New Yorker), and, this spring, the sixth module of the free seven-part\nPoetry in America MOOC, which has registrants in over 150 countries.\n\nGrowing rapidly, and outpacing our current staff and infrastructure, Poetry in America has a\nfundraising goal this year of 2.5 million dollars to fund its expanding group of projects. We've taken\na big step, hiring the design agency Threespot to help us develop our web presence. Our\nwebsite— to launch early 2016— will eventually serve as an online hub for our TV show and\neducational projects. We hope you'll join us then for a virtual launch!\n\nFinally, Jeffrey, you have been such a wonderful supporter of my Poetry in America project. The\nLeon Black gift changed everything for me last year. It paid salaries for staff | desperately needed to\ncomplete projects (detail below), but first and foremost, it gave me leverage, enabling me to set\ndown a Solid Harvard base for my activities by giving the school something to point to: this public\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_029243\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

The message,\nin other words, does not adequately convey the stakes of the game.\n\nWiener primarily warned of the social risks—trisks stemming from careless\nintegration of machine-generated decisions with governance processes and misuse (by\nhumans) of such automated decision making. Likewise, the current “serious” debate\nabout AI risks focuses mostly on things like technological unemployment or biases in\nmachine learning. While such discussions can be valuable and address pressing short-\nterm problems, they are also stunningly parochial. I’m reminded of Yudkowsky’s quip in\na blog post: “[A]sking about the effect of machine superintelligence on the conventional\nhuman labor market is like asking how US—Chinese trade patterns would be affected by\nthe Moon crashing into the Earth. There would indeed be effects, but you’d be missing\nthe point.”\n\nIn my view, the central point of the AI risk is that superintelligent AI is an\nenvironmental risk. Allow me to explain.\n\nIn his “Parable of the Sentient Puddle,” Douglas Adams describes a puddle that\nwakes up in the morning and finds himself in a hole that fits him “staggeringly well.”\nFrom that observation, the puddle concludes that the world must have been made for him.\nTherefore, writes Adams, “the moment he disappears catches him rather by surprise.” To\nassume that AI risks are limited to adverse social developments is to make a similar\nmistake. The harsh reality is that the universe was not made for us; instead, we are fine-\ntuned by evolution to a very narrow range of environmental parameters. For instance, we\nneed the atmosphere at ground level to be roughly at room temperature, at about 100 kPa\npressure, and have a sufficient concentration of oxygen. Any disturbance, even\ntemporary, of this precarious equilibrium and we die in a matter of minutes.\n\nSilicon-based intelligence does not share such concerns about the environment.\nThat’s why it’s much cheaper to explore space using machine probes rather than “cans of\nmeat.” Moreover, Earth’s current environment is almost certainly suboptimal for what a\nsuperintelligent AI will greatly care about: efficient computation. Hence we might find\nour planet suddenly going from anthropogenic global warming to machinogenic global\ncooling. One big challenge that AI safety research needs to deal with is how to constrain\na potentially superintelligent AI—an AI with a much larger footprint than our own—from\nrendering our environment uninhabitable for biological life-forms.\n\nInterestingly, given that the most potent sources both of AI research and AlI-risk\ndismissals are under big corporate umbrellas, if you squint hard enough the “AI as an\nenvironmental risk” message looks like the chronic concern about corporations skirting\ntheir environmental responsibilities.\n\nConversely, the worry about AI’s social effects also misses most of the upside.\nIt’s hard to overemphasize how tiny and parochial the future of our planet is, compared\nwith the full potential of humanity. On astronomical timescales, our planet will be gone\nsoon (unless we tame the sun, also a distinct possibility) and almost all the resources—\natoms and free energy—to sustain civilization in the long run are in deep space.\n\nEric Drexler, the inventor of nanotechnology, has recently been popularizing the\n\n74\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_016294\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

Dominate rather than\nnegotiate. Having daydreamed his way into ultimate bureaucratic power, he did not want\nto see himself as a bureaucrat. He was of a higher purpose and moral order. He was an\navenger. He was also, he believed, a straight shooter. There was a moral order in aligning\nlanguage and action—if you said you were going to do something, you do it.\n\nIn his head, Bannon carried a set of decisive actions that would not just mark the new\nadministration’s opening days, but make it clear that nothing ever again would be the\nsame. At the age of sixty-three, he was in a hurry.\n\n7 OK Ok\n\nBannon had delved deeply into the nature of executive orders—EOs. You can’t rule by\ndecree in the United States, except you really can. The irony here was that it was the\nObama administration, with a recalcitrant Republican Congress, that had pushed the EO\nenvelope. Now, in something of a zero-sum game, Trump’s EOs would undo Obama’s\nEOs.\n\nDuring the transition, Bannon and Stephen Miller, a former Sessions aide who had\nearlier joined the Trump campaign and then become Bannon’s effective assistant and\nresearcher, assembled a list of more than two hundred EOs to issue in the first hundred\ndays.\n\nBut the first step in the new Trump administration had to be immigration, in Bannon’s\ncertain view. Foreigners were the ne plus ultra mania of Trumpism. An issue often\ndismissed as living on the one-track-mind fringe—Jeff Sessions was one of its cranky\nexponents—it was Trump’s firm belief that a lot of people had had it up to here with\nforeigners. Before Trump, Bannon had bonded with Sessions on the issue. The Trump\ncampaign became a sudden opportunity to see if nativism really had legs. And then when\nthey won, Bannon understood there could be no hesitation about declaring their\nethnocentric heart and soul.\n\nTo boot, it was an issue that made liberals bat-shit mad.\n\nLaxly enforced immigration laws reached to the center of the new liberal philosophy\nand, for Bannon, exposed its hypocrisy. In the liberal worldview, diversity was an absolute\ngood, whereas Bannon believed any reasonable person who was not wholly blinded by the\nliberal light could see that waves of immigrants came with a load of problems—just look\nat Europe. And these were problems borne not by cosseted liberals but by the more\nexposed citizens at the other end of the economic scale.\n\nIt was out of some instinctive or idiot-savant-like political understanding that Trump\nhad made this issue his own, frequently observing, Wasnt anybody an American\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_019930\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

Trump’s hyperbole,\nexaggerations, flights of fancy, improvisations, and general freedom toward and mangling\nof the facts, were products of the basic lack of guile, pretense, and impulse control that\nhelped create the immediacy and spontaneity that was so successful with so many on the\nstump—while so horrifying to so many others.\n\nFor Bannon, Obama was the north star of aloofness. “Politics,” said Bannon with an\nauthority that belayed the fact that until the previous August he had never worked in\npolitics, “is a more immediate game than he ever played it.” Trump was, for Bannon, a\nmodern-day William Jennings Bryan. (Bannon had long talked about the need for a new\nWilliams Jennings Bryan in right-wing politics, with friends assuming Bannon meant\nhimself.) At the turn of the twentieth century, Bryan had enthralled rural audiences with\nhis ability to speak passionately and extemporaneously for apparently unlimited periods of\ntime. Trump compensated—in the theory of some intimates, including Bannon—for his\ndifficulties with reading, writing, and close focus with an improvisational style that\nproduced, if not exactly a William Jennings Bryan effect, certainly close to the exact\nopposite of the Obama effect.\n\nIt was part hortatory, part personal testimony, part barstool blow-hard, a rambling,\ndisjointed, digressive, what-me-worry approach that combined aspects of cable television\nrage, big-tent religious revivalism, Borscht Belt tummler, motivational speaking, and\nYouTube vlogging. Charisma in American politics had come to define an order of charm,\nwit, and style—a coolness. But another sort of American charisma was more in the\nChristian evangelical vein, an emotional, experiential spectacle.\n\nThe Trump campaign had built its central strategy around great rallies regularly\nattracting tens of thousands, a political phenomenon that the Democrats both failed to\nheed and saw as a sign of Trump’s limited appeal. For the Trump team, this style, this\nunmediated connection—his speeches, his tweets, his spontaneous phone calls to radio\nand television shows, and, often, to anyone who would listen—was revelatory, a new,\npersonal, and inspirational politics. For the other side, it was clownishness that, at best,\naspired to the kind of raw, authoritarian demagoguery that had long been discredited by\nand assigned to history and that, when it appeared in American politics, reliably failed.\n\nWhile the advantages of this style for the Trump team were now very clear, the\nproblem was that it often—in fact regularly—produced assertions that were not remotely\ntrue.\n\nThis had led increasingly to the two-different-realities theory of Trump politics.

The American complimented the Mexican on the quality of his fish.\n\n“How long did it take you to catch them?” the American asked.\n“Only a little while,” the Mexican replied in surprisingly good English.\n“Why don’t you stay out longer and catch more fish?” the American then asked.\n\n“T have enough to support my family and give a few to friends,” the Mexican said as he unloaded them\ninto a basket.\n\n“But ... What do you do with the rest of your time?”\n\nThe Mexican looked up and smiled. “I sleep late, fish a little, play with my children, take a siesta with\nmy wife, Julia, and stroll into the village each evening, where I sip wine and play guitar with my amigos.\nI have a full and busy life, sefior.”\n\nThe American laughed and stood tall. “Sir, ’m a Harvard M.B.A. and can help you. You should spend\nmore time fishing, and with the proceeds, buy a bigger boat. In no time, you could buy several boats with\nthe increased haul.

At that point, Colin, who was clearly worried, suggested the\ntwo of us withdraw to speak “soldier to soldier.” We retreated to his office.\nSpreading out a map of western Iraq, I went into greater detail, explaining how\nwe would remain in the Iraqi desert on a search-and-destroy mission against the\nmobile launchers. Colin stressed the efforts the Americans were making from\nthe air, and the commitment they’d shown to Israel. Not only had they delivered\nthe Patriots. They had allocated their best fighter jets, F-15E’s, to the task of\ntaking out the Scuds. It helped that he and I had got to know and respect each\nother, so it wasn’t an all-out argument.

The British troops blocked the main roads and patrolled\nthem. But they did not find or destroy a single mobile launcher. They ended up\nin gun battles with Iraqi troops.

And I have no doubt that the outcome, like the plan,\nwould have been almost identical if we had done it ourselves.\n\nAnd it did have an effect.

With the exception of a significant spike in oil prices due to the impact of\nsanctions on Iran or any escalation in US-Saudi tensions, we believe that the net impact of these\nshifts is not material enough to derail the US economic expansion or bull market.\n\nRisks that have abated\n\nMexico: the election of the left-of-center populist president (Andrés Manuel Lopes Obrador referred\nto as AMLO) has reduced fear of a reversal of recent reforms.

The more that people know about the robot, the easier it\nis to coordinate with it.\n\nAchieving action compatibility will require robots to anticipate human actions,\naccount for how those actions will influence their own, and enable people to anticipate\nrobot actions. Research has ,ade a degree of progress in meeting these challenges, but we\nstill have a long way to go.\n\nThe Value Alignment Problem: People hold the key to the robot’s reward function.\nProgress on enabling robots to optimize reward puts more burden on us, the designers, to\ngive them the right reward to optimize in the first place. The original thought was that\nfor any task we wanted the robot to do, we could write down a reward function that\nincentivizes the right behavior. Unfortunately, what often happens is that we specify\nsome reward function and the behavior that emerges out of optimizing it isn’t what we\nwant. Intuitive reward functions, when combined with unusual instances of a task, can\nlead to unintuitive behavior. You reward an agent in a racing game with a score in the\ngame, and in some cases it finds a loophole that it exploits to gain infinitely many points\nwithout actually winning the race. Stuart Russell and Peter Norvig give a beautiful\nexample in their book Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach: rewarding a\nvacuuming robot for how much dust it sucks in results in the robot deciding to dump out\ndust so that it can suck it in again and get more reward.\n\nIn general, humans have had a notoriously difficult time specifying exactly what\nthey want, as exemplified by all those genie legends. An AI paradigm in which robots\nget some externally specified reward fails when that reward is not perfectly well thought\nout. It may incentivize the robot to behave in the wrong way and even resist our attempts\nto correct its behavior, as that would lead to a lower specified reward.\n\nA seemingly better paradigm might be for robots to optimize for what we\ninternally want, even if we have trouble explicating it. They would use what we say and\ndo as evidence about what we want, rather than interpreting it literally and taking it as a\ngiven. When we write down a reward function, the robot should understand that we\nmight be wrong: that we might not have considered all facets of the task; that there’s no\nguarantee that said reward function will a/ways lead to the behavior we want. The robot\nshould integrate what we wrote down into its understanding of what we want, but it\nshould also have a back-and-forth with us to elicit clarifying information. It should seek\nour guidance, because that’s the only way to optimize the true desired reward function.\n\nEven if we give robots the ability to learn what we want, an important question\nremains that AI alone won’t be able to answer. We can make robots try to align with a\nperson’s internal values, but there’s more than one person involved here. The robot has\nan end-user (or perhaps a few, like a personal robot caring for a family, a car driving a\nfew passengers to different destinations, or an office assistant for an entire team); it has a\ndesigner (or perhaps a few); and it interacts with society—the autonomous car shares the\nroad with pedestrians, human-driven vehicles, and other autonomous cars. How to\ncombine these people’s values when they might be in conflict is an important problem we\nneed to solve. AI research can give us the tools to combine values in any way we decide\nbut can’t make the necessary decision for us.\n\n101\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_016904\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

Often labor management\ndisputes arise because one or both sides are mis-\ninformed about their rights. Often the employer\ntakes an action it truly believes is within its rights\nwhen it is not.\n\nComment of Civil Service Employees Association.\n\n89 Thus, the many comments that assert that\nemployees can just use Internet search engines to\nfind out about unions (see, e.g., comments of\nWinseda Corp. Homestead Village, Inc.},\nmisapprehend the breadth of the rights of which the\nBoard seeks to apprise all employees. As stated\nabove, Section 7 is not merely about the right to join\nor refrain from joining a labor organization, but\nmore broadly protects the right of employees to\nengage in ‘concerted activities” for the purpose of\n“mutual aid or protection.” It is this right that is\nthe most misunderstood and simply not subject to\nan easy Internet search by employees who may have\nno idea of what terms to use, or even that sucha\nright might be protected at all.\n\nwill not be effective in informing\nemployees of their rights, because\nemployees will simply ignore the\nnotices, as the comments contend they\nignore other workplace postings.\n“Posters are an ineffective means of\neducating workers and are rarely read\nby employees.” 9° Other comments\nargue that adding one more notice to the\nmany that are already mandated under\nother statutes will simply create more\n“visual clutter” that contributes to\nemployees’ disinclination to pay\nattention to posted notices. As one\nemployer stated, ‘““My bulletin boards\nare filled with required notifications\nthat nobody reads. In the past 15 years,\nnot one of our 200 employees has ever\nasked about any of these required\npostings. I have never seen anyone ever\nread one of them.” %! Another wrote,\n“Employers are already required to post\nso many notices that these notices have\nlost any semblance of effectiveness as a\ngovernmental communication channel.”\n\nTo these comments, the Board\nresponds that the experiences of the\ncommenters is apparently not universal;\nother comments cited above contend\nthat employees are more knowledgeable\nabout their rights under statutes\nrequiring the posting of notices\nsummarizing those rights than about\ntheir NLRA rights. Moreover, not every\nemployee has to read workplace notices\nfor those notices to be effective. If only\none employee of a particular employer\nreads the Board’s notice and conveys\nwhat he or she has read to the other\nemployees, that may be enough to pique\ntheir interest in learning more about\ntheir NLRA rights. In addition, the\nBoard is mandating electronic notice to\nemployees on an internet or intranet\nsite, when the employer customarily\ncommunicates with its employees about\npersonnel rules or policies in that way,\nin order to reach those who read paper\nnotices and those who read electronic\npostings. As for the comment that\nargues that the Board can use public\nservice announcements or advertising to\nreach employees, the Board believes\nthat it makes much more sense to seek\nto reach directly the persons to whom\nthe Act applies, in the location where\nthey are most likely to hear about their\nother employment rights, the\nworkplace.9\n\n28° Comment of Riverbend Community Mental\nHealth.\n\n®1Comment of Farmers Cooperative Compress.\n\n®2 Printing Industries of America uses election\ndata to argue that the Labor Department’s notice\nposting rule for Federal contractors has not been\neffective because the rate of elections has not\nincreased.

It also would help carry a message of intolerance to perverts who prey on\ngirls.\n\nProsecutors did not pursue charges against Mr. Epstein reflecting the age of the victims\nbecause they assumed a jury would view the girls not as victims but as promiscuous,\nuntrustworthy, willing participants. The presumption is offensive.\n\nMr. Epstein, a 53-year-old Manhattan money manager who has hired Harvard law\nprofessor Alan Dershowitz and defense attorney Jack Goldberger, has denied knowing\nhow old the girls were. But police interviews with five alleged victims and 17 witnesses\nunder oath, as well as phone messages, a high school transcript and other items that\npolice found from searching Mr. Epstein's trash and 7,234-square-foot waterfront home,\nprovide evidence that he knew the girls were teenagers.\n\nOne girl couldn't show up when Mr. Epstein wanted because she had soccer. Another\ntime, Mr. Epstein had to wait for his \"massage\" session because the girl he wanted was\nstill in class.\n\nWhy didn't State Attorney Barry Krischer let a jury decide whether to believe the\nteenagers - including a 16-year-old who went to Mr. Epstein's house to \"work\" in\nDecember 2004 after being asked whether she needed to make money for Christmas\ngifts?\n\nProsecutors gave greater weight to the details Mr. Dershowitz provided about the girls in\nan apparent effort to assail their character. Mr. Dershowitz pointed out to prosecutors that\nsome of the teenagers had talked on myspace.com about marijuana and alcohol use.\n\nThe 20-year-old Royal Palm Beach woman who told police she recruited girls for Mr.\nEpstein has a Web page on myspace.com that features one girl using the name \"Pimpin'\nMade EZ.\"\n\nAlthough no charges of witness tampering have been filed, the parents of at least one of\nthe teenage victims complained to police of being followed and intimidated by two men.\nPolice determined that their vehicles were registered to two private investigators. Mr.\nGoldberger denied knowing anything about it.\n\nPolice also note in their reports that the state attorney's office offered Mr. Epstein a plea\ndeal that would have placed him on probation for five years, allowing him ultimately to\nwalk away with no criminal record at all.\n\nI asked Mr. Krischer's spokesman, Mike Edmondson, why the case was referred to a\ngrand jury instead of Mr. Epstein being charged and facing a trial before a jury. And\nshouldn't the victims' credibility be a factor to determine whether a crime's been\ncommitted, not whether a jury will convict?

Humans—indeed, probably all life-forms—are often stuck\nin local minima.\n\nTake our understanding of the game of Go, which was taught and learned and\noptimized by humans for thousands of years. It took Als less than three years to find out\nthat we’d been playing it wrong all along and that there were better, almost alien,\nsolutions to the game which we’d never considered—mostly because our brains don’t\nhave the processing power to consider so many moves ahead.\n\nEven in chess, which is ten times easier and was thought to be understood, brute-\nforce machines could beat us at our own strategies.

It’s as if we had been playing 2D versions of games that actually existed in\nhigher dimensions.\n\nIf any of this sounds familiar, it’s because physics has been wrestling with these\nsorts of topological problems for decades. The notion of space being many-dimensional,\nand math reducing to understanding the geometries and interactions of “membranes”\nbeyond the reach of our senses, is where Grand Unified Theorists go to die. But unlike\nmultidimensional theoretical physics, AI is something we can actually experiment with\nand measure.\n\nSo that’s what we’re going to do. The next few decades will be an explosive\nexploration of ways to think that 7 million years of evolution never found. We’re going\nto rock ourselves out of local minima and find deeper minima, maybe even global\nminima.

On the morning of May 24,\n1992, a 15-year-old Israeli schoolgirl named Helena Rapp was on her way to\ncatch the bus to school south of Tel Aviv, when another Gazan stabbed her to\ndeath. To the extent Israelis were looking for someone to blame, there were\nobvious candidates. The army, the primary defense against the intifada, was\none. The police even more so, since many of the attacks were now taking place\ninside Israel. And in ugly rioting after Helena Rapp’s murder, bands of Israelis\ntook to the streets, some of them yelling: “Death to the Arabs’. Still, most\npeople understood that criticizing the army or the police, or going on a rampage\nagainst “the Arabs” — hundreds of thousands of whom were Israeli citizens and\nhad lived among us since the birth of the state — would not help. Most, in fact,\nplaced the blame, and lodged their hopes, with the government.\n\nBy the time of the next election, in June 1992, the combination of Palestinian\nviolence and the still-traumatic memories of Saddam’s Scuds, left Israelis\ndoubtful that Shamir could fulfil the most basic responsibility of government:\nensuring their day-to-day security. Labor had once again placed its electoral\nfortunes in the hands of Yitzhak Rabin, following Peres’s several failed\nattempts to lead the party back into power. Knowing that Rabin had a record of\nmilitary command unmatched in Israeli politics, Labor strategists did not so\nmuch need to convince voters as to reinforce their fears and frustrations. One of\nthe campaign slogans, a direct appeal to the anger over the stabbing of Helena\nRapp, was “Get Gaza out of Tel Aviv!” Labor ended up gaining five Knesset\nseats, and now had 44. The Likud lost eight and was left with only 32.\n\nThat meant that my last three years as chief of staff would be with Rabin\nback as Prime Minister — and, like Ben-Gurion before him, as Defense Minister\nas well. He and I had been in touch only occasionally since his departure from\nthe unity-coalition government two years earlier. But I had, of course, spoken\nwith him after my appointment as ramatkal, in which he’d played an important\npart. Though he was 20 years older than me, our relationship had become\nsteadily closer over the years, especially when I’d worked with him as Defense\nMinister. In some ways, we were alike. We’d both been forged by Labor\nZionism. We were career military officers, uncomfortable with flights of\npolitical rhetoric and convinced that Israel’s security and its future depended\nless on words than on action. In large groups especially, both of us tended to be\nmen of a few words. Over the next few years, we would become even closer,\nspeaking not only in the kirya or at Yitzhak’s office in Jerusalem, but also, with\nNava and Leah, around the dinner table at Rabin’s apartment in Tel Aviv.\n\n244\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_028092\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

It may even have infinite bandwidth. Physicists argue whether\nspace-time is quantized but, for now, we will look at what would be\nneeded to reproduce the experience faithfully on modern digital\nrecording equipment.\n\nDigitization\nWhen something is converted to digital form, it goes through a number\nof steps. First, some way must be found to chop the thing into small parts\nin space and time. Then each of these parts is sampled with a sensor to\ngive an electrical signal and, finally, this signal is measured and turned\ninto a number.\n\nOld microphones used carbon granules. As the sound waves passed\nthrough them, the granules were shaken and made better contact with\neach other. Connecting a battery across the granules gave a varying\nvoltage. Modern microphones use a variety of technologies. The\npreference of most recording artists today is the electret microphone.\nA coil moves inside a magnet generating a varying voltage which is\ntranslated into a voltage as before.\n\nNext we use a fast running clock and measure the voltage on each\ntick giving us a sequence of numbers. We have created a near perfect\nrecord of the sound, and we can prove this by recreating the sound\nthrough a loudspeaker. This is what happens every time you listen to\nyour iPod.\n\nTo digitize film, each frame must be split in space as well as time.\nOn each tick of the clock, a process scans left to right and top to bottom\nto form a one-dimensional stream of numbers that records the image.\nThe system cuts the picture up into little elements called pixels, standing\nfor picture elements. Each small square has its average color measured\nfor red, green, and blue content coded as a number.\n\nDigitization techniques have become the dominant way electronics\nwork in the home, and digitization circuits are now ubiquitous.\n\nReality\n\nHow big is reality? Setting aside for a moment the problem that it might\n\nbe infinite, we need to reproduce all the elements that go to make it up.\nA normal DVD has an image of 720 by 576 pixels with 16 bits of\n\ncolor depth and a frame rate of 25 frames per second.

This quantum leap in performance has been noticed by his\nsupervisors and his value to the company has increased, making it more expensive to lose him. More\nvalue means more leverage for negotiations. Sherwood has been sure to hold back some of his\nproductivity and efficiency so that he can highlight a sudden jump in both during a remote work trial\nperiod.\n\nSince eliminating most of his meetings and in-person discussions, he has naturally moved about 80%\nof all communication with his boss and colleagues to e-mail and the remaining 20% to phone. Not only\nthis, but he has used tips from chapter 7, “Interrupting Interruption and the Art of Refusal,” to cut\nunimportant and repetitive e-mail volume in half. This will make the move to remote less noticeable, if at\nall noticeable, from a managerial standpoint. Sherwood is running at full speed with less and less\nsupervision.\n\nSherwood implements his escape in five steps, beginning on July 12 during the slow business season\nand lasting two months, ending with a trip to Oktoberfest in Munich, Germany, for two weeks as a final\ntest before bigger and bolder vagabonding plans.\n\nStep 1: Increase Investment\n\nFirst, he speaks with his boss on July 12 about additional training that might be available to employees.\nHe proposes having the company pay for a four-week industrial design class to help him better interface\nwith clients, being sure to mention the benefit to the boss and business (i.e., he’ll decrease\nintradepartmental back-and-forth and increase both client results and billable time). Sherwood wants the\ncompany to invest as much as possible in him so that the loss is greater if he quits.\n\nStep 2: Prove Increased Output Offsite\nSecond, he calls in sick the next Tuesday and Wednesday, July 18 and 19, to showcase his remote\n\nworking productivity.2 He decides to call in sick between Tuesday and Thursday for two reasons: It\nlooks less like a lie for a three-day weekend and it also enables him to see how well he functions in\nsocial isolation without the imminent reprieve of the weekend. He ensures that he doubles his work\noutput on both days, leaves an e-mail trail of some sort for his boss to notice, and keeps quantifiable\nrecords of what he accomplished for reference during later negotiations. Since he uses expensive CAD\nsoftware that is only licensed on his office desktop, Sherwood installs a free trial of GoToMyPC remote\naccess software so that he can pilot his office computer from home.\n\nStep 3: Prepare the Quantifiable Business Benefit\n\nThird, Sherwood creates a bullet-point list of how much more he achieved outside the office with\nexplanations. He realizes that he needs to present remote working as a good business decision and not a\npersonal perk. The quantifiable end result was three more designs per day than his usual average and\nthree total hours of additional billable client time. For explanations, he identifies removal of commute\nand fewer distractions from office noise.\n\nStep 4: Propose a Revocable Trial Period\n\nFourth, fresh off completing the comfort challenges from previous chapters, Sherwood confidently\nproposes an innocent one-day-per-week remote work trial period for two weeks. He plans a script in\nadvance but does not make it a PowerPoint presentation or otherwise give it the appearance of something\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_013941\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

He regarded atomic weapons and the development of missiles\nwith nuclear warheads as a recipe for the suicide of the human species. He compared the\nheadlong exploitation of the planet’s resources with the Mad Tea Party of Alice in\nWonderland: Having laid waste to one local environment, we make progress simply by\nmoving on to lay waste to the next. Wiener’s optimism about the development of\ncomputers and neuro-mechanical systems was tempered by his pessimism about their\nexploitation by authoritarian governments, such as the Soviet Union, and the tendency for\ndemocracies, such as the United States, to become more authoritarian themselves in\nconfronting the threat of authoritarianism.\n\nWhat would Wiener think of the current human use of human beings? He would\nbe amazed by the power of computers and the Internet. He would be happy that the early\nneural nets in which he played a role have spawned powerful deep-learning systems that\nexhibit the perceptual ability he demanded of them—although he might not be impressed\nthat one of the most prominent examples of such computerized Gestalt is the ability to\nrecognize photos of kittens on the World Wide Web. Rather than regarding machine\nintelligence as a threat, I suspect he would regard it as a phenomenon in its own right,\ndifferent from and co-evolving with our own human intelligence.\n\nUnsurprised by global warming—the Mad Tea Party of our era—Wiener would\napplaud the exponential improvement in alternative-energy technologies and would apply\nhis cybernetic expertise to developing the intricate set of feedback loops needed to\nincorporate such technologies into the coming smart electrical grid. Nonetheless,\nrecognizing that the solution to the problem of climate change is at least as much political\nas it is technological, he would undoubtedly be pessimistic about our chances of solving\nthis civilization-threatening problem in time. Wiener hated hucksters—political\nhucksters most of all—but he acknowledged that hucksters would always be with us.\n\nIt’s easy to forget just how scary Wiener’s world was. The United States and the\nSoviet Union were in a full-out arms race, building hydrogen bombs mounted on nuclear\nwarheads carried by intercontinental ballistic missiles guided by navigation systems to\nwhich Wiener himself—to his dismay—had contributed. I was four years old when\nWiener died. In 1964, my nursery school class was practicing duck-and-cover under our\ndesks to prepare for a nuclear attack. Given the human use of human beings in his own\nday, if he could see our current state, Wiener’s first response would be to be relieved that\nwe are still alive.\n\n20\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_016243\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

It would also\ntotally isolate Saddam internationally and end any chance of peeling off Arab\nsupport for the Americans.\n\nIt was my nearly 100-per-cent caveat that prompted a tense debate within the\ncabinet. Even if the probability of a chemical attack was microscopic, any risk\nof civilians being subjected to terror, panic and very possibly agonizing death\nmeant that the government had to take precautions. The obvious first step would\nbe to distribute gas masks. But in a series of meetings with Misha and Dan, I\nemphasized this was not a decision that could be taken in isolation. By handing\nout gas masks, we might actually raise the probability of a chemical attack. We\nalso had to make sure as a matter of urgency that we had a workable military\noption to attack Iraq’s Scud launchers.\n\nBy early November, I was dealing both with plans for distributing the gas\nmasks and preparations for a possible military operation. So when I got a call\nasking me to report to Shamir’s office in Jerusalem, I assumed he wanted to talk\nabout Iraq. “How are things?” he asked. But when I began by filling him in on\nthe plans to distribute the gas-masks, he interrupted me. “I called you here,” he\nsaid, “because I wanted you to know that we’ve decided that when Dan leaves\nnext April, we want you to replace him as chief-of-staff.” Briefly and unusually\ntongue-tied, I said: “Thank you, Prime Minister’. The news was made public\nthe next morning. A few days later, it was ratified by the government. There\nwas only one vote against, from a former chief of staff who was now Shamir’s\nAgriculture Minister: Raful Eitan.\n\nI was one of rare instances in all my years in the army when I took a step\nback, appreciating a moment which felt special. It was not only, or even mainly,\na matter of a personal ambition fulfilled. More a sense that I was being given\nthe opportunity to apply everything I’d experienced and learned in the army,\nfrom the day I first joined Sayeret Matkal as an 18-year-old, to improve the\nsecurity and safeguard the future of Israel. I know that sounds corny. But, while\nthe momentum toward war in Iraq almost immediately crowded out everything\nelse again, that was truly how I felt.\n\n231\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_028079\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

This\nfinal rule sets forth the Board’s review\nof and responses to comments on the\nproposal and incorporates any changes\nmade to the rule in response to those\ncomments.\n\nThe Board believes that many\nemployees protected by the NLRA are\nunaware of their rights under the statute\nand that the rule will increase\nknowledge of the NLRA among\nemployees, in order to better enable the\nexercise of rights under the statute. A\nbeneficial side effect may well be the\npromotion of statutory compliance by\nemployers and unions.\n\nThe final rule establishes the size,\nform, and content of the notice, and sets\nforth provisions regarding the\nenforcement of the rule.\n\nDATES: This rule will be effective on\nNovember 14, 2011.\n\nFOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:\nLester A. Heltzer, Executive Secretary,\nNational Labor Relations Board, 1099\n14th Street, NW., Washington, DC\n20570, (202) 273-1067 (this is not a toll-\nfree number), 1-866-315-6572 (TTY/\nTDD).\n\nSUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:\n\nI. Background on the Rulemaking\n\nThe NLRA, enacted in 1935, is the\nFederal statute that regulates most\nprivate sector labor-management\nrelations in the United States.1 Section\n7 of the NLRA, 29 U.S.C. 157,\nguarantees that\n\nEmployees shall have the right to self-\norganization, to form, join, or assist labor\norganizations, to bargain collectively through\nrepresentatives of their own choosing, and to\nengage in other concerted activities for the\npurpose of collective bargaining or other\n\n1 Labor-management relations in the railroad and\nairline industries are governed by the Railway\nLabor Act, 45 U.S.C. 151 et seq.\n\nmutual aid or protection, and shall also have\nthe right to refrain from any or all such\nactivities[.]\n\nIn Section 1, 29 U.S.C. 151, Congress\nexplained why it was necessary for\nthose rights to be protected:\n\nThe denial by some employers of the right\nof employees to organize and the refusal by\nsome employers to accept the procedure of\ncollective bargaining lead to strikes and other\nforms of industrial strife or unrest, which\nhave the intent or the necessary effect of\nburdening or obstructing commerce[.] * * *\n* * * * *\n\nExperience has proved that protection by\nlaw of the right of employees to organize and\nbargain collectively safeguards commerce\nfrom injury, impairment, or interruption, and\npromotes the flow of commerce by removing\ncertain recognized sources of industrial strife\nand unrest, by encouraging practices\nfundamental to the friendly adjustment of\nindustrial disputes arising out of differences\nas to wages, hours, or other working\nconditions, and by restoring equality of\nbargaining power between employers and\nemployees.\n\n* * * * *\n\nIt is declared to be the policy of the United\nStates to eliminate the causes of certain\nsubstantial obstructions to the free flow of\ncommerce and to mitigate and eliminate\nthese obstructions when they have occurred\nby encouraging the practice and procedure of\ncollective bargaining and by protecting the\nexercise by workers of full freedom of\nassociation, self-organization, and\ndesignation of representatives of their own\nchoosing, for the purpose of negotiating the\nterms and conditions of their employment or\nother mutual aid or protection.\n\nThus, Congress plainly stated that, in its\njudgment, protecting the rights of\nemployees to form and join unions and\nto engage in collective bargaining would\nbenefit not only the employees\nthemselves, but the nation as a whole.\nThe Board was established to ensure\nthat employers and, later, unions\nrespect the exercise of employees’ rights\nunder the NLRA.?\n\nFor employees to fully exercise their\nNLRA rights, however, they must know\nthat those rights exist and that the Board\nprotects those rights. As the Board\nexplained in its Notice of Proposed\nRulemaking (NPRM), 75 FR 80410, it\nhas reason to think that most do not.3\n\n2 The original NLRA did not include restrictions\non the actions of unions; those were added in the\nLabor-Management Relations (Taft-Hartley) Act of\n1947, 29 U.S.C. 141 et seq., Title I.\n\n3 The Board cited three law review articles in\nwhich the authors contended that American\nworkers are largely unaware of their NLRA rights,\nthat the Board can take action to vindicate those\nrights, and that this lack of knowledge stands in the\nway of employees’ effectively exercising their\nrights. Peter D. DeChiara, ‘‘The Right to Know: An\nArgument for Informing Employees of Their Rights\nunder the National Labor Relations Act,’’ 32 Harv.\nJ. on Legis. 431, 433-434 (1995); Charles J. Morris,\n\nThe Board suggested a number of\nreasons why such a knowledge gap\ncould exist—the low percentage of\nemployees who are represented by\nunions, and thus lack an important\nsource of information about NLRA\nrights; the increasing proportion of\nimmigrants in the work force, who are\nunlikely to be familiar with their\nworkplace rights; and lack of\ninformation about labor law and labor\nrelations on the part of high school\nstudents who are about to enter the\nlabor force.*\n\nOf greatest concern to the Board,\nhowever, is the fact that, except in very\nlimited circumstances, no one is\nrequired to inform employees of their\nNLRA rights.5 The Board is almost\nunique among agencies and\ndepartments administering major\n\n“Renaissance at the NLRB—Opportunity and\nProspect for Non-Legislative Procedural Reform at\nthe Labor Board,” 23 Stetson L. Rev. 101, 107\n(1993); Morris, “NLRB Protection in the Nonunion\nWorkplace: A Glimpse at a General Theory of\nSection 7 Conduct,” 137 U. Pa. L. Rev. 1673, 1675-\n1676 (1989). 75 FR at 80411.\n\n4 Id.\n\n5 The Board requires that employees be notified\nof their NLRA rights in only the following narrow\ncircumstances: (1) For the three working days\nbefore a Board-conducted representation election,\nthe employer is required to post a notice of election\nincluding a brief description of employee rights; see\n29 CFR 103.20. (2) When an employer or a union\nhas been found to have violated employee rights\nunder the NLRA, it is required to post a notice\ncontaining a brief summary of those rights. (3)\nBefore a union may seek to obligate newly hired\nnonmember employees to pay dues and fees under\na union-security clause, it must inform them of\ntheir right under NLRB v. General Motors, 373 U.S.\n734 (1963), and Communications Workers v. Beck,\n487 U.S. 735 (1988), to be or remain nonmembers\nand that nonmembers have the right to object to\npaying for union activities unrelated to the union’s\nduties as the bargaining representative and to obtain\na reduction in dues and fees of such activities.\nCalifornia Saw & Knife Works, 320 NLRB 224, 233\n(1995), enfd. sub nom.

(4) When an employer voluntarily\nrecognizes a union, the Board has required that the\nemployer must post a notice informing employees:\n(i) That the employer recognized the union on the\nbasis of evidence that it was designated by a\nmajority of the unit employees; (ii) the date of\nrecognition; (iii) that all employees, including those\nwho previously signed cards for the recognized\nunion, have the right to be represented by a labor\norganization of their choice, or no union at all; (iv)\nthat within 45 days of the date of the notice a\ndecertification or rival petition, supported by 30\npercent or more of the unit employees, may be filed\nwith the Board and will be processed to an election;\nand, (v) that ifno petition is filed within 45 days,\nthe recognition will not be subject to challenge for\na reasonable period to allow the employer and\nunion to negotiate a collective-bargaining\nagreement.

However, the tradition in cognitive psychology is to separate out Working Memory and\nLong Term Memory from the cognitive processes acting thereupon, so we have adhered to that\nconvention. The other changes from Sloman’s diagram are the explicit inclusion of language,\nrepresenting the hypothesis that language processing is handled in a somewhat special way in\nthe human brain; and the inclusion of a reinforcement component parallel to the perception and\naction hierarchies, as inspired by intelligent control systems theory (e.g. Albus as mentioned\nabove) and deep learning theory.

The\nboxes in the upper left corner of the LIDA diagram pertain to sensory and motor processing,\nwhich LIDA does not handle in detail, and which are modeled more carefully by deep learning\ntheory.

Although many of the nodes have specific semantic refer-\nents, as in a classical semantic net, the spread of activation through the network is designed to\nlead to the emergence of “assemblies” (which could also be thought of as dynamical attractors)\nin a manner more similar to an attractor neural network.\n\nA major difference from typical semantic or neural network models is the central role that\naffect plays in the system’s dynamics. The weights of the links in the knowledge base are adjusted\ndynamically based on the emotional context — a very direct way of ensuring that cognitive\nprocesses and mental representations are continuously influenced by affect. Qualitatively, this\nmimics the way that particular emotions in the human brain correlate with the dissemination\nthroughout the brain of particular neurotransmitters, which then affect synaptic activity.\n\nA result of this architecture is that in Joshua Blue, emotion directs attention in a very direct\nway: affective weighting is important in determining which associated objects will become part of\nthe focus of attention, or will be retained from memory. A notable similarity between CogPrime\nand Joshua Blue is that in both systems, nodes are assigned two quantitative attention values,\none governing allocation of current system resources (mainly processor time; this is CogPrime’s\nShortTermImportance) and one governing the long-term allocation of memory (CogPrime’s\nLongTermImportance).\n\nThe concrete work done with Joshua Blue involved using it to control a simple agent in a sim-\nulated world, with the goal that via human interaction, the agent would develop a complex and\nhumanlike emotional and motivational structure from its simple in-built emotions and drives,\nand would then develop complex cognitive capabilities as part of this development process.\n\n4.5.7 LIDA\n\nThe LIDA architecture developed by Stan Franklin and his colleagues [BF 09] is based on the\nconcept of the “cognitive cycle” - a notion that is important to nearly every BICA (Biologically\nInspired Cognitive Architectures) and also to the brain, but that plays a particularly central\nrole in LIDA. As Franklin says, \"as a matter of principle, every autonomous agent, be it human,\nanimal, or artificial, must frequently sample (sense) its environment, process (make sense of)\nthis input, and select an appropriate response (action). The agent’s “life” can be viewed as\nconsisting of a continual sequence of iterations of these cognitive cycles. Such cycles constitute\nthe indivisible elements of attention, the least sensing and acting to which we can attend. A\ncognitive cycle can be thought of as a moment of cognition, a cognitive \"moment\".\"\n\n4.5.8 The Global Workspace\n\nLIDA is heavily based on the “global workspace” concept developed by Bernard Baars. As this\nconcept is also directly relevant to CogPrime it is worth briefly describing here.\n\nIn essence Baars’ Global Workspace Theory (GWT) is a particular hypothesis about how\nworking memory works and the role it plays in the mind. Baars conceives working memory as the\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_013000\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

I find myself focusing more and more on\nthat cash flow component of rate of return, or pure consumption rate at the\n\ncollective scale, as the part we can predict and model.\n\nThe generation length is a biological norm which probably has not varied by more\nthan a factor of two since Ancestral Eve some 200,000 year ago. This suggests that\nnext generation theory can be tested against data from any period. Meanwhile it\npredicts only at the collective scale. Collective return is average risk return. Subtract\ncollective growth rate to leave cash flow rate. Return and growth are two of the\nmost closely measured rates in economics. That says that tests of next generation\n\ntheory should be practical. I will show tables broadly in support.\n\nNext generation theory is a blockbuster. An explanation of interest and return has\nbeen the Holy Grail of capital theory. Boehm Bawerk contributed a big advance by\nrevealing return as an artifact of time preference rather than the other way around.\n\nSome including Irving Fisher have seen that beautiful insight as enough.\n\nNot me.

Since the time the world promised “never again” at the end\nof World War II and built a structure and jurisprudence designed to fulfill that important promise,\nanother six million innocent victims of preventable genocides have been slaughtered while the\nworld once again stood silent.\n\nSince the Holocaust, the international community has turned a blind eye as genocides across the\nglobe claimed millions of innocent lives. Cambodia, Rwanda, and Darfur are just the beginning of\nthe story. The UN has also failed to help desperate civilians in Burundi, the former Yugoslavia,\nSyria, and other countries. While ignoring the gruesome killings by the member states in its\nmidst, the United Nations has focused its time and attention on a single country—Israel. The\nnumbers are staggering. In the last eight years, Israel has garnered more than six times as many\nUN condemnatory resolutions than any other country in the world.’ The General Assembly has\ncalled only ten special emergency sessions in its history, but six of them have been devoted to the\nMiddle East’s only liberal democracy.'°’ Of course Israel has its shortcomings, but it deserves to\nbe subjected to the same scrutiny as every other state, no more and no less.\n\nThe UN’s obsession with Israel is not necessarily the only cause of its inaction on genocide, but it\nis certainly a contributing factor. Like all institutions, the United Nations has limited resources.\nWhen it dedicates so many of those resources to criticizing Israel it decreases its ability to\nrespond effectively to genocide. It is important to realize that the sheer amount of time the UN\nspends chastising Israel in one-sided and repetitive resolutions is also time vor spent on genocide.\nAs the NGO UN Watch notes, “Diplomats at foreign ministries or UN missions have a limited\namount of time to devote to any particular UN session. Because every proposed UN resolution is\nsubjected to intensive review by various levels and branches of government, a direct result of the\nanti-Israel texts is a crippling of the UN’s ability to tackle the world’s ills.”!°* What could have\nbeen if, during the Cambodian genocide, the General Assembly passed a single resolution on the\natrocities instead wasting time debating whether Zionism was racism? How would the situation in\nDarfur have changed if, during its 2006-2007 sessions, the General Assembly once condemned\nthe genocide in Sudan instead of passing 22 resolutions condemning Israel?\n\nOne might easily dismiss the UN’s obsession with Israel, if the body’s failure to stop suffering was\nnot so serious and not so real. The UN could have intervened more quickly and vigorously and\nsaved millions of lives in Cambodia, Darfur, Rwanda, the former Yugoslavia, Syria and numerous\nother places. It is a broken institution. Until it ends its obsession with Israel, the UN cannot be\nfixed.\n\nIt will remain the key perpetrator—through its actions and inactions—of the tragic inversion of\nhuman rights over the past 40 years.\n\n16 Bye on the UN, http://www.eyeontheun.org/browse-un.asp?ya=1 &sa=1 &ua=1 &s=0&tp=1 &tpn=Resolution.\n107 American Jewish Committee, A Diminished Body: An Overview of the UN and Israel 5,\nhttp://www.ajc.org/atf/cf/%7B42D75369-D582-4380-8395-\nD25925B85EAF%7D/DIMINISHEWORLDBODYOVERVIEWUNISRAEL 2006.PDF.\n\n108 UN Watch, UN, Israel & Anti-Semitism,\n\nhttp://www.unwatch.org/site/c.bdKKISNqEmG/b. 1359197/k.6748/UN_Israel__AntiSemitism.htm.\n\n342\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_017429\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

The Old Testament prophets, who delivered the underlying logic,\nincluded Thomas Hobbes and Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz. The New Testament prophets\nincluded Alan Turing, John von Neumann, Claude Shannon, and Norbert Wiener. They\ndelivered the machines.\n\nAlan Turing wondered what it would take for machines to become intelligent.\nJohn von Neumann wondered what it would take for machines to self-reproduce. Claude\nShannon wondered what it would take for machines to communicate reliably, no matter\nhow much noise intervened. Norbert Wiener wondered how long it would take for\nmachines to assume control.\n\nWiener’s warnings about control systems beyond human control appeared in\n1949, just as the first generation of stored-program electronic digital computers were\nintroduced. These systems required direct supervision by human programmers,\nundermining his concerns. What’s the problem, as long as programmers are in control of\nthe machines? Ever since, debate over the risks of autonomous control has remained\nassociated with the debate over the powers and limitations of digitally coded machines.\nDespite their astonishing powers, little real autonomy has been observed. This is a\ndangerous assumption. What if digital computing is being superseded by something\nelse?\n\nElectronics underwent two fundamental transitions over the past hundred years:\nfrom analog to digital and from vacuum tubes to solid state. That these transitions\noccurred together does not mean they are inextricably linked. Just as digital computation\nwas implemented using vacuum tube components, analog computation can be\nimplemented in solid state. Analog computation is alive and well, even though vacuum\ntubes are commercially extinct.\n\nThere 1s no precise distinction between analog and digital computing. In general,\ndigital computing deals with integers, binary sequences, deterministic logic, and time that\nis idealized into discrete increments, whereas analog computing deals with real numbers,\nnondeterministic logic, and continuous functions, including time as it exists as a\ncontinuum in the real world.\n\nImagine you need to find the middle of a road. You can measure its width using\nany available increment and then digitally compute the middle to the nearest increment.\nOr you can use a piece of string as an analog computer, mapping the width of the road to\nthe length of the string and finding the middle, without being limited to increments, by\ndoubling the string back upon itself.\n\nMany systems operate across both analog and digital regimes. A tree integrates a\nwide range of inputs as continuous functions, but if you cut down that tree, you find that\nit has been counting the years digitally all along.\n\n37\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_016257\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

I will spell out today's argument a bit better and cohesive\nwhen I get to it. Also, I should have recognized that the main point I tried to make would trigger Noam\n(who was as always very generous, patient, kind and humble on the personal level, even though he did not\nfeel like conceding anything on the conceptual one). Almost all of Noam's work focused on the idea that\nhumans have very specific circuits or modules (even when most people in his field began to have other\nideas), and his frustration is that it is so hard to find or explain them.\n\nI found Noam's hypothesis very compelling in the past. I still think that the idea that language is somehow a\ncultural or social invention of our species is wrong. But I think that there is a chance (we don't know that,\nbut it seems to most promising hypothesis IMHO) that the difference between humans and apes is not a\nvery intricate special circuit, but genetically simple developmental switches. The bootstrapping of cognition\nworks layer by layer during the first 20 years of our life. Each layer takes between a few months and a few\nyears to train in humans. While a layer is learned, there is not much going on in the higher layers yet, and\nafter the low level learning is finished, it does not change very much. This leads to the characteristic bursts\nin child development, that have famously been described by Piaget.\n\nThe first few layers are simple perceptual stuff, the last ones learn social structure and self-in-society. The\nswitching works with something like a genetic clock, very slowly in humans, but much more quickly in\nother apes, and very fast in small mammals. As a result, human children take nine months before their\nbrains are mature enough to crawl, and more than a year before they can walk. Many African populations\nare quite a bit faster. In the US, black children outperform white children in motor development, even in\nvery poor and socially disadvantaged households, but they lag behind (and never catch up) in cognitive\ndevelopment even after controlling for family income.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_026409\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

Whether the idea has to do with politics, policy,\npersonnel or governing style, we’re looking for suggestions that are specific and, above all, surprising; something inventive if\nslightly far-fetched is better than a pet cause or a well-trod policy proposal.

When the cabinet convened, he pointed\nout to the ministers that the London terrorists were from a fringe Palestinian\ngroup led by Abu Nidal. Far from being an ally of Arafat, he had been\nsentenced to death by Fatah. According to Gideon, Begin wasn’t interested in\nthe distinction. Even less so were the two leading military figures in attendance:\nArik and Raful. They said all Palestinian terror was the responsibility of Arafat,\nand that now was the time to hit back hard. The cabinet was informed that our\ninitial response would be limited: aerial and artillery bombardment of PLO\ntargets throughout Lebanon. Yet Raful told the cabinet that the Palestinians\nwould almost certainly respond with shell and rocket fire into Israel. Then, he\nsaid, we could strike more forcefully. In other words, the invasion would begin.\n\nIt did. Dubbed “Operation Peace for Galilee” to convey the aim of protecting\nnorthern Israel from shell and rocket fire, it got underway at around 11 a.m. on\nSunday June 6. The publicly declared aim was Little Pines: the establishment of\nour 40-kilometer security zone. Both Israelis and the Americans were led to\nbelieve it would be a relatively short operation aimed at destroying the PLO’s\nmilitary capacity in the border area. We also said that we wouldn’t attack Syrian\nforces as long as they didn’t attack us.\n\nThat last public pledge had particular relevance to my role on the ground. I\nwas deputy commander of the largest of Israel’s three invasion forces, under\nYanoush Ben-Gal, head of the northern command until shortly before the war.\nWe had 30,000 troops and 600 tanks and were responsible for the “eastern\nsector’ — from the edge of the Golan Heights, north through the Bekaa Valley\nalong Lebanon’s border with Syria. At first, we deliberately stopped short of\nSyrian forces. We deployed our main reserve division just 10 kilometers across\nthe border, below the first Syrian positions at the bottom of the Bekaa. But\ndespite the public assurances we were in Lebanon to establish our security zone,\nwe had no orders to halt at the 40-kilometer line. From day one, our part of the\ninvasion force began a pincer movement around the area of eastern Lebanon\nwhere large numbers of Syrian soldiers were based. My former Sinai division,\nthe 252™, came down from the Golan and started making its way up alongside\nthe Syrian border.

Bennett allowed his client to be\nquestioned under oath in a deposition about the details of his sex life and to deny that he\nhad sexual relations with Monica Lewinsky. This sworn denial became the basis for an\nimpeachment investigation and opened the way for the President to have to testify in front\nof a grand jury. The Paula Jones case should have been settled immediately after the\nPresident’s reelection in 1996. If Paula Jones’ lawyers refused to settle the case, Bennett\ncould have advised the President simply to default — that is to pay the money and refuse to\n\ncontest the charges. Bennett never even told Clinton about this option.\n\nThe second greatest blunder, believe it or not, was also committed by Bennett. After\nwalking his client into the perjury trap, Bennett himself helped to spring it. Not content to\nlet the President answer the opposing lawyers’ questions, Bennett did the unthinkable: he\nasked the President to affirm, under oath, the truth of Monica Lewinsky’s affidavit\nwithout having asked Lewinsky what she meant when she said she had not engaged in\nsexual relations with Clinton. Then, Bennett mischaracterized the affidavit by saying that\nthe affidavit indicated that “there is absolutely no sex of any kind in any manner, shape or\nform.” Finally, in a “cover your ass” letter to the court, Bennett implicitly blamed his client\nfor misleading the court, instead of forthrightly acknowledging his own failure to find out\nwhat Lewinsky meant by sexual relations. These blunders give Bennett almost unique\nbragging rights as the only lawyer in American history who has helped his client get\nimpeached.\n\nAt the very beginning of the Lewinsky matter, I had received a call from someone close to the\nWhite House giving me the phone number where Monica was staying and urging me to call her.

It must be done in a way\nthat the theft remains undetected.” From his perspective, there were two requisites that had to be\nfulfilled to assure the success of any intelligence theft. The first task is the obvious one: acquiring\nby espionage an adversary’s state secrets. The second task is concealment of that success.\nDeception is employed to obscure the nature and the extent of the espionage theft. This deception\nis necessary to extend the usefulness of theft. One of the most famous examples of this principle\nwas the deceptions used by British intelligence in the Second World War to conceal its success in\nbreaking the German ciphers generated by the Enigma machines. If German naval intelligence\ndiscovered Britain was able to read the ciphers it used to communicate with its U-boats, it would\nhave stopped using them. So British intelligence hid its coup by supplying false information to\nknown German spies to account for the sinking of U-boats, including the canard that British aerial\ncameras could detect one ingredient in the paint used to camouflage the U-boats. That same\nhoary principle of deception applies to modern-day communications intelligence. If the Russian,\nChinese or any other adversary intelligence service got its hands on the documents stolen by\nSnowden from the NSA’s repositories in Hawaii in 2013, it would likely employ deception,\nincluding well-crafted lies, to create as much ambiguity as possible as to the ultimate disposition\nof the missing documents. From this counterintelligence perspective, the intelligence issue that\nspawned the great divide cannot be resolved by accepting the uncorroborated statements made by\na source, such as Snowden, who may be in the hands of the Russian security services in Moscow.\n\nBy the same token, the calculations made by NSA officials about the extent of the theft are also\nsuspect. After all, the NSA is an intelligence service that often engages in secret machinations.\nWe know that its top officials reported to the House and Senate Intelligence Committees, as well\nas the President’s National Security Adviser, that over one million documents were compromised\nby Snowden. But if this was disinformation, it is difficult to see its purpose. Inflating the extent\nof the damage of the Snowden breach to the President, Congress and the Secretary of Defense\nobviously reflected poorly on their own management of the NSA, and their own careers. Yet\nsuch a possibility cannot be precluded in the arcane world of intelligence.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_020182\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

Booz Allen, like other private firms that did work for the gov-\nernment, was in the business to make money. Indeed, it had found\ngovernment contracts so much more profitable than its work in\nthe private sector that it sold its private sector unit to Price Water-\nhouse.

This careful management of uncertainty is critical for\nthe application of logical inference in the robotics context, where most knowledge is abstracted\nfrom experience and is hence highly uncertain.\n\nPLN can be used in either forward or backward chaining mode; and in the language intro-\nduced above, it can be used for either analysis or synthesis. As an example, we will consider\nbackward chaining analysis, exemplified by the problem of a robot preschoolstudent trying to\ndetermine whether a new playmate “Bob” is likely to be a regular visitor to is preschool or not\n(evaluating the truth value of the implication Bob > regular_ visitor). The basic backward\nchaining process for PLN analysis looks like:\n\n1. Given an implication L = A — B whose truth value must be estimated (for instance\nL = Concept Procedure > Goal as discussed above), create a list (Az, ..., An) of (inference\nrule, stored knowledge) pairs that might be used to produce L\n\n2. Using analogical reasoning to prior inferences, assign each A; a probability of success\n\ne If some of the A; are estimated to have reasonable probability of success at generating\nreasonably confident estimates of D’s truth value, then invoke Step 1 with A; in place\nof LE (at this point the inference process becomes recursive)\n\ne If none of the A; looks sufficiently likely to succeed, then inference has “gotten stuck”\nand another cognitive process should be invoked, e.g.\n\n— Concept creation may be used to infer new concepts related to A and B, and then\nStep 1 may be revisited, in the hope of finding a new, more promising A; involving\none of the new concepts\n\n— MOSES may be invoked with one of several special goals, e.g. the goal of finding\na procedure P so that P(X) predicts whether X — B. If MOSES finds such a\nprocedure P then this can be converted to declarative knowledge understandable\nby PLN and Step 1 may be revisited....\n\n— Simulations may be run in CogPrime’s internal simulation engine, so as to observe\nthe truth value of A > B in the simulations; and then Step 1 may be revisited...\n\nThe combinatorial explosion of inference control is combatted by the capability to defer to\nother cognitive processes when the inference control procedure is unable to make a sufficiently\nconfident choice of which inference steps to take next. Note that just as MOSES may rely\non PLN to model its evolving populations of procedures, PLN may rely on MOSES to create\ncomplex knowledge about the terms in its logical implications. This is just one example of the\nmultiple ways in which the different cognitive processes in CogPrime interact synergetically; a\nmore thorough treatment of these interactions is given in [Goe09al.\n\nIn the “new playmate” example, the interesting case is where the robot initially seems not\nto know enough about Bob to make a solid inferential judgment (so that none of the A; seem\nparticularly promising). For instance, it might carry out a number of possible inferences and not\ncome to any reasonably confident conclusion, so that the reason none of the A; seem promising\nis that all the decent-looking ones have been tried already. So it might then recourse to MOSES,\nsimulation or concept creation.\n\nFor instance, the PLN controller could make a list of everyone who has been a regular\nvisitor, and everyone who has not been, and pose MOSES the task of figuring out a procedure\nfor distinguishing these two categories. This procedure could then be used directly to make the\nneeded assessment, or else be translated into logical rules to be used within PLN inference.

Over a period of years, the Supreme Court placed\nits moral imprimatur on desegregation and eventually unblocked these channels of democracy. It\nworked — not perfectly, but perfection is rarely possible in a heterogeneous and divided\ndemocracy. A similar process is today underway with regard to equality for gays.\n\nAbortion is different. The Supreme Court’s decision, now more half a century old, changed few\nminds on this issue, because those who believe that abortion — or certain kinds of abortion — is\ntantamount to murder are not like those who believed that segregation was right. The former\nbelieve that they occupy the moral high ground. And they do, if their underlying premise — that a\nfetus is a human being — is correct. No rational argument, whether made by philosophers or\nSupreme Court justices, will ever disprove the truth of that a priori premise. Nor will experience\nalter it, unlike views concerning segregation or gay rights which have been markedly changed by\nexperience.\n\nMoreover, the nation was — and remains — closely divided about the morality of abortion, both in\nthe abstract and under various circumstances. Advocates of a woman’s right to choose abortion\ncould have organized politically to win that right (at least for most women under most\ncircumstances) in the elected branches of government. According to the ACLU:\n\nBetween 1967 and 1971, under mounting pressure from the women’s rights\nmovement, 17 states decriminalized abortion. Public opinion also shifted during\nthis period. In 1968, only 15 percent of Americans favored legal abortions; by\n1972, 64 percent did. When the Court announced its landmark 1973 ruling\nlegalizing abortion in Roe v. Wade, it was marching in step with public opinion.\n\nBut it is not the proper role of the Supreme Court to march “in step” with public opinion. That is\nthe role of the elected branches of government. Instead of devoting all their resources to\ncontinuing the legislative and public opinion battle, the pro-choice movement devoted much of its\nresources to the litigation option, whose goal it was to get the Supreme Court to constitutionalize\na woman’s right to choose abortion. It worked as planned, thus sparing the pro-choice movement\nthe difficult political task of organizing and fundraising on a state-by-state basis. The justices did\nthe work for them, by simply striking down most abortion laws in one fell swoop.\n\nThe short-term consequences of constitutionalizing the abortion issue were powerful and positive\nfor the choice movement. The long-term consequences were disastrous. Roe v. Wade provided\nthe Religious Right and the conservative wing of the Republican Party one of the best organizing\ntools and rallying cries imaginable. The right-to-life movement was energized by this decision and\nbecame one of the most potent political forces both nationally and in a large number of states. At\nthe same time, the pro-choice movement became lethargic, celebrating its great judicial victory\nand neglecting the hard work of organizing and fundraising — at least in the beginning. As the\nACLU has put it:\n\n... the backlash was swift and fierce. Anti-choice forces quickly mobilized,\ndedicating themselves to reversing Roe. In 1974, the ACLU established its\n\n314\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_017401\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

But the core\nof the argument comes in the first 400 pages, which is not an\ninsurmountable challenge for the intellectually curious — particularly\ngiven that Parfit, in the best tradition of English-language\nphilosophy, always strives for lucidity, never using obscure words\nwhere simple ones will do. Each sentence is straightforward, the\nargument is clear, and Parfit often uses vivid examples to make his\npoints. Thus, the book is an intellectual treat for anyone who wants to\nunderstand not so much “what matters” as whether anything really\ncan matter, in an objective sense.\n\nMany people assume that rationality is always instrumental: reason\ncan tell us only how to get what we want, but our basic wants and\ndesires are beyond the scope of reasoning. Not so, Parfit argues. Just\nas we can grasp the truth that 1 + 1 = 2, so we can see that I have a\nreason to avoid suffering agony at some future time, regardless of\nwhether I now care about, or have desires about, whether I will suffer\nagony at that time. We can also have reasons (though not always\nconclusive reasons) to prevent others from suffering agony. Such self-\nevident normative truths provide the basis for Parfit’s defense of\nobjectivity in ethics.\n\nOne major argument against objectivism in ethics is that people\ndisagree deeply about right and wrong, and this disagreement extends\nto philosophers who cannot be accused of being ignorant or\nconfused. If great thinkers like Immanuel Kant and Jeremy Bentham\ndisagree about what we ought to do, can there really be an objectively\ntrue answer to that question?\n\nParfit’s response to this line of argument leads him to make a claim\nthat is perhaps even bolder than his defense of objectivism in ethics.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_031910\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

Thanks for keeping me informed. Best, Woody.”\n\nDuring the Apartheid regime, I was invited to speak at the Witwatersrand University in\nJohannesburg. Many in that university had been on the forefront of opposing Apartheid and I was\nanxious to lend support to these efforts by delivering a strong human rights message. When I\nappeared at the South African consulate in Boston to receive my Visa, the Counsel General was\nwell prepared: he had on his desk the Yale Law Journal article I had edited. He told me that\nbefore he could consider my application, he wanted to see a copy of my proposed speech. I\ndeclined his request, citing freedom of expression. I did not receive the Visa and had to postpone\nmy first visit to South Africa until after the end of apartheid.\n\nI had hoped not only to speak against apartheid during my aborted visit to South Africa, but also\nto try to get to Robin’s Island to meet with the imprisoned Nelson Mandela. I was working with\nProfessor Irwin Cotler, with whom I had taught human rights at Harvard Law School, on a\ncomplicated legal plan to free Mandela.\n\nOur plan began following the arrest of an East German professor in Boston on charges of spying\nfor his country. I received a call from an East German lawyer asking if I could represent him or\nrecommend a good lawyer who could. The East German lawyer—who was a well known and\ntrusted “spy-swapper’—told me that his client was innocent, but that the East German might be\nwilling to arrange a “spy swap” for my client Anatoly Sharanksy. I told him that my client wasn’t\na spy so a “spy swap” was off the table. He responded “neither is my client.” He then proposed a\npossible “prisoner exchange, including prisoners who were accused of spying but were innocent.”\nIt was an interesting idea.\n\nI then called my friend and colleague Irwin Cotler in Canada and told him of the call. He was, at\nthe time, working on both the Sharansky and Mandela case, and he had previously sought my\nadvice on the Mandela matter. He suggested that we inquire whether there were any South\nAfrican spies in Soviet Block prisons, and whether South Africa might be willing to release\nMandela as part of a prisoner exchange among several countries.\n\nIn the end, Sharansky was exchanged for the East German man (who was represented by other\nlawyers), but we learned from the African National Congress lawyers with whom we were\nconferring that Mandela refused to participate in any prisoner exchange, particularly one that\ninvolved anyone accused of spying. He wanted to be released on his own terms, even though his\ndecision would require him to remain imprisoned until his own terms were accepted by the South\nAfrica government, as they finally were in 1990.\n\nMy negotiations with the East German lawyer were shrouded in secrecy and had elements right\nout of a John Le Carre novel. We used code words over the phone and met in out of the way\n\nplaces at unusal times. He was a man of his word and could always be counted on to honor his\ncommitments.

Guest Post by Jim Krane: Dubai, Not Obama, is the Mideast's Best \nPeace Hope Tuesday, Sep 01 2009, 3:11PMThis is a guest note by Jim Krane, a former AP Persian Gulf correspondent. His new \nbook on Dubai, City of Gold: Dubai and the Dream of Capitalism, is available. \nAs Americans, Israelis and Palestinians continue their endless peace-jockeying, a more hopeful solution has emerged. It is a fresh \nArab initiative that depends neither on America nor Israel. \nIt is Dubai. \nDubai, you must know, is the flashy Gulf city-state that is one of the seven United Arab Emirates. In my book, I argue that Dubaians, \ndescended from illiterate Bedouin who faced starvation in the 1940s, have authored the most exciting Arab accomplishment in 700 \nyears. \n>From nowhere, Dubai has mushroomed into a trading city-state on the lines of Hong Kong and Singapore, with sidelines in real \nestate and tourism. \nDubai accomplished all this without (much) oil, and without the help - or even recognition of the United States. While Washington \nhas been caught up prolonging the Israel-Palestinian conflict and starting a war in Iraq, Dubai was erecting one of the worlds most \nspectacular cities. So, how can Dubai fix the Middle East? It certainly can't do much to help Palestinians suffering under Israeli \nmisrule. \nBut that is the point. Dubai has succeeded in spite of the plight of the Palestinians, and in spite of what Arab leaders describe as US \nmeddling that stymies their development. One of the favorite themes of Dubai leader Sheikh Mohammed is that his counterparts \nshould stop bloviating about the Israelis and start serving the interests of their own citizens. \nDubai's wild growth backs up Sheikh Mohammed's message. His business-before-politics way is becoming a development model for \nthe rest of the Arab world. \nBut wait, Dubai is in financial trouble. How could it be a role model?Dubai's downturn is temporary. Being one of the worlds most \nglobalized cities, it couldn't help but be infected by a global recession. The contagion kneecapped each one of its economic pillars: \nShipping, logistics, tourism, and its binging real estate sector. Most of these pillars remain sound. \nDubai's economic example isn't widely understood in Washington. But its a good thing. Emulating Dubai could make Arab countries \nmore stable and secure, along with the rest of us. For America, which has mistreated Dubai despite synergies with our interests, its a \nwindfall. \nIf you remember, Dubai in 2006 bought US port operations and found itself vilified as a terrorist logistics center. Members of \nCongress now in the Obama administration -- among them the senator who is now president -- joined the Dubai-bashing. Well, it \nmay turn out that this \"terrorist logistics center\" has one of the keys for fixing the Mideast's terrorism problem. \nThe Dubai model is a mixture of social freedom, unbridled immigration, and raw capitalism. It is overseen by a government that is \none of the world's least democratic. This is no accident. Dubai avoids both elections and the Arab obsession with politics, especially \nthe syndrome of feeling slighted by the West. \nDubai is pragmatic. It makes money doing business with Israel and Iran, countries shunned by other Arab states. The city's finessing \nof simultaneous friendships with Washington and Tehran is as deft as it is precarious. \nDubai's government wrings efficiencies using schemes from Harvard Business School and General Electric. Its use of strategic \nplanning is a new concept in the Middle East. Dubai conceives developments, like no-tax business parks, and builds them exactly as \npromised. \nIn contrast with the surrounding police states, Dubai functions on the honor system. Alcohol is legal. Prostitution is tolerated. A nice \nexample is the e-Gate scheme, which allows residents to use a biometric card to skip passport control. None of the neighbors has the \nconfidence to replace state security with a smart card. Not Saudi Arabia, not Iran, not Israel. \nSaudis and Iranians, especially, find a refreshing dignity in Dubai, a respect for their ability to make the right choice. \"Friday you can \npray, but Thursday night you might want to go to the bar,\" says a Dubai-based Saudi. \"It's up to you. \"Dubai is certainly taking risks. \nBut rulers from Morocco to Iran are already Xeroxing parts of the Dubai playbook and waiting to see how the more controversial \napproaches pan out. For some, its a matter of self-preservation: Dubai's state-led development doesn't involve elections. For others \nits a bid to stop the hemorrhage of bright citizens and cash fleeing to Dubai. \nAll of them ought to do more. Egypt, with its unemployed masses, could make use of Dubai's incentives for foreign investment. \nSyria might adopt its free trade ways. Iraq and Israel could use a dose of its religious tolerance. And its Gulf neighbors might \nstreamline their bureaucracies as Dubai has. \nOf course, there are areas where neighbors emulate Dubai to their detriment. Dubai's abusive \"in-sourced\" labor market is one. Real \nestate is another. One hopes Dubai's property crash taught admirers what not to copy. And Dubai pays no heed to the environment. \nThus Dubaians, with their monster 4x4s and chilled swimming pools, are the worlds most prolific polluters. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 025361 \nBut overall, Dubai's self-help mentality is the best hope for dragging this stagnant region into the global economic mainstream, with \nthe accompanying stability and peace it implies.

Consistent\nwith the trend seen earlier in the year, 2016 has been described by investors and financial media as among\nthe worst years for multi-manager multi-strategy firms, on both an absolute and risk-adjusted return basis.\nWhile we consider earning +3.84% to be disappointing for our strategy on an absolute return basis, doing so\nwith a maximum drawdown of 1.4%, and in what was a challenging environment for low-net exposure\nrelative value strategies, leaves us viewing 2016 as a “good” bad year.\nFor a second consecutive year, the Fund generated positive net returns overall on the days when the S&P\n500 Index was negative. The S&P had 121 losing days in 2016 (producing losses of over -66% in total) 3 and\non those days, we were positive approximately 55% of the time, and generated almost half of our total net\nreturns for the year. Given that we aim to be a protector of capital in markets that most managers will lose\ncapital, this sampling is especially gratifying. As we look forward, we remain as encouraged as ever that our\ncombination of unique “niche” strategies and strategies with structural edge, alongside our allocations to\nlow-beta alpha-generating stock pickers and quantitative portfolio managers, will deliver strong riskadjusted\nreturns over various market cycles.\nBefore going into the performance attribution for Q4 and 2016 overall, we want to re-visit a topic discussed\nin our Q1 2016 letter related to hedge fund crowding, which investors have continued to ask us about the\npast several months. The question raised is typically some variation of the following: Given that Boothbay\nallocates to low-net equity focused managers, who may have similar strategies to those that comprise other\nmulti-manager platforms, why has Boothbay been less-exposed to deleveraging and hedge fund crowding\n1 Assumes Boothbay Absolute Return Strategies, LP, Onshore Accelerator Share Class 1A (2-year lock and 14% incentive allocation).\n2\nPerformance figures reported herein are shown unaudited, net of fees/allocations and expenses; include the reinvestment of dividends, capital gains,\nand other earnings; and may be subject to adjustment.\n3 S&P 500 negative-return analysis calculated using Bloomberg closing prices for SPX Index.\neffects, which seem to impact other multi-manager funds in a greater way?\nPlatform Beta\nEquity market performance is a large predictor of returns for many long/short equity hedge funds, due to the\nlarge equity beta exposure with which many funds run. 4 At Boothbay, we generally run with limited net\nequity market exposure (on average 6-8% historically) and have maintained low correlation to market\nindices. While the sources of our returns will generally be idiosyncratic, there is no question that the\ntremendous amount of capital that has flown into the low-net multi-manager, i.e. “platform”, category, has\ncreated an even greater risk of exposure to “Platform Beta” for some of our managers, even while avoiding\nbroader equity market beta.\nPlatform Beta is a term we have heard used to describe the overlap of long and short positions, across some\nof the largest market-neutral, multi-manager hedge fund managers. While these overlapping names may be\nviewed as “smart money” positioning in some sense, there is also meaningful risk associated with being in\ncrowded longs and shorts due to the viciousness of the cascading effects when these portfolios are being\nliquidated, or re-sized quickly, as we observed in Q1 2016. For a variety of reasons, we believe that\nPlatform Beta has a true positive expectancy over time and with much less risk than other traditional factor\nrisks, especially ones taken on by long-only or long-biased investors. While we consider it to be an obvious\ngoal to avoid material exposure to all known market risk factors, we also attempt to reduce our more\ndifficult to measure Platform Beta exposure when possible. Despite the positive return expectation of\nPlatform Beta, we do not think a large or concentrated exposure to this factor is beneficial. Perhaps even\nmore importantly, we do not believe that all alpha is created equally, and we are trying to provide the most\nuncorrelated alpha as possible to our investors.\nSo how do we minimize overexposure to Platform Beta? We can monitor data that imperfectly points to\ncrowded names or themes, but the most direct way we seek to avoid crowded names is through our overall\nportfolio construction and manager-selection process. This is demonstrated in our continued focus on “First\nLoss” allocations as well as investments in the strategy category we call “Other”, which is comprised of\nniche strategies outside our more traditional long/short fundamental and quantitative strategies. These\nalternative categories have served as a valuable source of alpha as well as diversification away from\nPlatform Beta. Additionally, even in our more traditional strategies, we focus on allocating to smaller\nmanagers who can have larger parts of their portfolios in smaller capitalization companies, which tend to be\nless trafficked by the larger funds, and therefore are also less subject to the effects of large industry\ndeleveraging. We cannot avoid all of the dangers of hedge fund deleveraging but our conscious attempts to\ntarget differentiated strategies, and to limit concentration, has allowed us to be less impacted by these flows\nthan several other multi-manager platforms.\nPortfolio Attribution and Risk\nWithin our Multi-Strategy platform, the “Other” category was the largest contributor for both Q4 and 2016\noverall, contributing gross returns of +0.82% in Q4 and +2.19% YTD. The remaining quarterly and full-year\ngross return attribution within the Multi-Strategy platform were: “Fundamental L/S” at -0.86% in Q4 and\n+1.16% YTD, and “Quantitative” at 0.29% in Q4 and -1.53% YTD. Our First Loss platform allocations\ncontributed gross-returns of +0.72% in Q4 and +6.60% YTD. 5\nThe Fund averaged approximately 0.39% daily Value at Risk during Q4 vs. 0.41% in Q3 (95% Confidence\nInterval, excluding First-Loss allocations). As stated in last quarter’s letter, we expect to see an increase in\nour VaR during Q1 2017 primarily through a combination of new manager allocations and a pick-up in\noverall market volatility due to macro events on the horizon. We expect the Trump Presidency, additional\n4\nFor example, Goldman Sachs Prime Services reported hedge fund net exposure to be between 50% and 67% throughout 2016.

These factors should help us to approach our target daily VaR of\n0.80%, and also provide an attractive environment for many of our strategies to generate alpha. While\nhaving more risk on the balance sheet does imply that our return volatility and drawdowns will be larger, it\nis reasonable to expect that any positive returns would increase as well.\nManager Attribution:\n�\n�\n�\nFor the fourth quarter of 2016, 42% of “Fundamental L/S,” 45% of “Quantitative,” and 67% of\n“Other” managers were profitable.\nThe top five performing managers contributed 38% of the quarterly total positive return, with the\nlargest single manager positively contributing 9%.

When we invest for our own benefit, we expect recovery by\nourselves. When we invest for the sake of others, we expect recovery by them.\nRecovery means recovery of depreciation. Our parents would not have invested in\nour human capital without expected recovery of our human depreciation by us, and\nthe young further invest the work of learning in themselves because they expect\n\nthat to be recovered with interest as well.\n\nThere is another proof which I call the deadweight loss rule. Capital of any kind is\npresent value of cash flow, meaning expected realizations in transfer or taste\nsatisfaction. Deadweight loss means decapitalization with neither. It follows that\ndeadweight loss, although a common reality, is implicitly unexpected. But human\ndepreciation, like plant depreciation, is expected from first investment. That rules\nout deadweight loss, and makes human depreciation expected as cash flow by\n\nelimination of alternatives.\n\nEach proof is sufficient. The first expresses what I call the maximand rule: we\nmaximize risk-adjusted rate of return. Robert Turgot observed this in 1766. I'll say\nmore about that in the next chapter. It takes little thought to realize that maximizing\nrisk-adjusted return begins with recovery of investment, and that this means\nrecovery of depreciation or amortization. We are depleted like the oil well, although\nwe create value too. The second proof needs only the assumption that human\ndepreciation is foreseen. It adds the specification that human depreciation is\nrealized in human cash flow. That turns out to mean that it is realized in pay. The\nsolution to the age-wage puzzle is that pay does not equal and compensate realized\n\nwork above. It compensates that plus human depreciation.

Jacob did still insist on helping financially, which\nallowed my father to enroll at the Hebrew University in Jerusalem.\n\nHe did well in his studies — literature, history and philosophy — but\nabandoned them after two years. His explanation for not staying on, when I\nasked him years later, was that with the accelerating activity of the Zionist\npioneers, it felt wrong to him to spend his days going to lectures, reading books\nand writing essays. I am sure that he also felt isolated and alone, with Meir, the\nonly link to his life before Palestine, working in Haifa on the coast, four or five\nhours by bus from Jerusalem. When he began looking for a way to become part\nof the changes going on around him, Mishmar Hasharon didn’t yet exist. Its\nfounding core — a dozen Russian Jewish pioneers — was still working on\nargicultural settlements near Herzliya, north of Tel Aviv, until they found a\nplace to start their kibbutz. But they had been joined by several young men and\nwomen who, though a year or two older than my father, had been with him at\nthe Hebrew High School in Ponovezh. He decided to join them.\n\nLate in 1932, the Jewish National Fund, supported financially by leading\nJewish figures in western Europe and the US, bought 2,000 acres from an Arab\nlandowner near Wadi Khawaret. The area was set aside for three Jewish\nsettlements: a moshav called Kfar Haim, where the land was divided into family\nplots, and two kibbutzim. One was called Ma’abarot. Next to it was Mishmar\nHasharon. My father was among the seventy youngsters who set off in three\ntrucks with everything they figured they would need to turn the hard, scrubby\nhill into a kibbutz. They built the core from pre-fab kits: wooden huts to sleep in\nand a slightly larger one for the dining hall. They dug a well and ordered a\npump from Tel Aviv, at first for drinking and washing, but soon allowing them\nto begin a vegetable garden, a dairy with a dozen cows, a chicken coop with a\nfew hundred hens, and to plant a first orange grove and a small vineyard.\n\nStill, by the time my mother arrived three years later, there were not enough\ncitrus trees, vines, cattle and chickens to occupy a membership which now\nnumbered more than 200. Along with some of the others, my father worked\noutside the kibbutz, earning a regular paycheck to help support the collective.\nOn his way back, he would stop at the post office in Tel Aviv to pick up letters\nand packages for the rest of the kibbutz — including Ya’akov Margalit’s love\nletters to my mother. That was how my parents’ friendship began, how a\nfriendly hello led to shared conversation at the end of my father’s working day,\nand how, a few years later, my mother decided to spurn her Gordonia suitor in\nfavor of Srulik Brog, the postman.

You get exposed to a little bit of evil, a little bit of rule-breaking, a little bit of\ndishonesty... you can come to justify it.”\n\n—Snowden in Moscow, 2014\n\nEdward John Snowden was born on June 21, 1983 in Elizabeth City, North Carolina. His\nparents, Lon Snowden and Elizabeth “Wendy” Barrett, according to their marriage records, wed\nwhen they were both 18 in 1979. The following year they had a daughter, Jessica.\n\nLon Snowden, like his father before him, served in the U.S. Coast Guard. He was stationed at\nits main aviation base, where his father-in-law Edward John Barrett, was an officer and rising star\nof the Coast Guard. While Edward Snowden was still a child, his grandfather would become not\nonly an admiral but the head of the Coast Guard’s entire aviation service. Admiral Barrett would\nbe the only grandfather, Edward Snowden would ever know. His paternal grandfather died\nbefore he was born in a fatal car crash. He had had a drinking problem and killed a woman in a\nprior car crash.)\n\nWhen Lon was transferred to a Coast Guard base near Baltimore in 1992, the family moved to\nMaryland. Lon bought a two-story house in Croften, Maryland, a residential community very\nclose to the NSA’s headquarters building at Fort Meade. The two children, Edward, who was\nnine, and Jessica, who was 12, were enrolled in local public schools in Croften.\n\nJessica was a top student. She graduated high school, completed both her courses at University\nof Maryland and went on to law school, where she graduated with honors. Unlike his sister,\nSnowden experienced a string of failures in his education. In 1998, after only one year of classes,\nhe dropped out of Arundel High School. According to school records, he stopped attending\nclasses at the age of fifteen. He later attributed his absence from school to a medical problem,\nmononucleosis, but according to Robert Mosier, a spokesman for Anne Arundel County public\nschools, there is no record of any medical illness. Brad Gunson, who knew him before he dropped\nout of high school, recalled in an interview with the Washington Post only that he had a high-\npitched voice, liked magic cards, and played fantasy video games. Nor did Snowden receive\nhome schooling or ever get a high school diploma.\n\nInstead, Snowden became the product of a broken home. His parents were entangled in a\nmessy divorce fight until he was seventeen. By this time Jessica had her own apartment.

It was easier at least.\n\nAm I really successful or just kidding myself?\n\n5. Have I lowered my standards to make myself a winner? Are my friends, who are now making\ntwice as much as three years ago, really on the right track?\n\n6. Why amI not happy’? I can do anything and I’m still not happy. Do I even deserve it?\n\nMost of this can be overcome as soon as we recognize it for what it is: outdated comparisons using the\nmore-is-better and money-as-success mind-sets that got us into trouble to begin with. Even so, there is a\nmore profound observation to be made.\n\nThese doubts invade the mind when nothing else fills it. Think of a time when you felt 100% alive and\nundistracted—in the zone. Chances are that it was when you were completely focused in the moment on\nsomething external: someone or something else. Sports and sex are two great examples. Lacking an\nexternal focus, the mind turns inward on itself and creates problems to solve, even if the problems are\nundefined or unimportant. If you find a focus, an ambitious goal that seems impossible and forces you to\n\ngrow,®! these doubts disappear.\n\nIn the process of searching for a new focus, it is almost inevitable that the “big” questions will creep\nin. There is pressure from pseudo-philosophers everywhere to cast aside the impertinent and answer the\neternal. Two popular examples are “What is the meaning of life?” and “What is the point of it all?”\n\nThere are many more, ranging from the introspective to the ontological, but I have one answer for\nalmost all of them—I don’t answer them at all.\n\nI’m no nihilist. In fact, ?ve spent more than a decade investigating the mind and concept of meaning,\na quest that has taken me from the neuroscience laboratories of top universities to the halls of religious\ninstitutions worldwide. The conclusion after it all is surprising.\n\nI am 100% convinced that most big questions we feel compelled to face—handed down through\ncenturies of overthinking and mistranslation—use terms so undefined as to make attempting to answer\nthem a complete waste of time.®2 This isn’t depressing. It’s liberating.\n\nConsider the question of questions: What is the meaning of life?\n\nIf pressed, I have but one response: It is the characteristic state or condition of a living organism. “But\nthat’s just a definition,” the questioner will retort, “that’s not what I mean at all.” What do you mean,\nthen? Until the question is clear—each term in it defined—there is no point in answering it. The\n“meaning” of “life” question is unanswerable without further elaboration.\n\nBefore spending time on a stress-inducing question, big or otherwise, ensure that the answer is “yes”\nto the following two questions:\n\n1. Have I decided on a single meaning for each term in this question?\n\n2. Can an answer to this question be acted upon to improve things’?\n\n“What is the meaning of life?” fails the first and thus the second. Questions about things beyond your\nsphere of influence like “What if the train is late tomorrow’?” fail the second and should thus be ignored.\nThese are not worthwhile questions. If you can’t define it or act upon it, forget it. If you take just this\npoint from this book, it will put you in the top 1% of performers in the world and keep most\nphilosophical distress out of your life.\n\nSharpening your logical and practical mental toolbox is not being an atheist or unspiritual. It’s not\nbeing crass and it’s not being superficial. It’s being smart and putting your effort where it can make the\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_013982\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

Turkey in May officially designated Mr. Gulen's network a terrorist organization, making \nmembership a crime under Turkish law. \nMr. Erdogan's government has pressed the Obama administration since the coup to extradite Mr. Gulen, \narguing that pursuing the imam is part of the broader campaign against terrorism. At times, the Turkish leader's \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 031472 \naides have said Ankara would view as hostile any foreign government that gave sanctuary to leaders of the \nGulen movement. \nTurkey hasn't yet made a formal extradition request to the U.S., and Turkish officials say they plan to provide \nmore evidence to the Justice Department. \nMr. Gulen, 75 years old, came to the U.S. in 1999, and has a devoted following in Turkey and other countries. \nAt a press conference in Washington on Friday, Mr. Gulen's lawyers said they have spoken to the Justice \nDepartment about the demands for extradition but are unaware of the U.S. government's thinking or plans. \nAsked if they feared for his life, one of Mr. Gulen's lawyers, Reid Weingarten said, \"We do. We're very \nconcerned about his safety.\" The lawyer said they are discussing whether to ask U.S. authorities for help in \nsafeguarding their client. \nA Turkish court has issued a warrant for Mr. Gulen's arrest, and Turkish and U.S. authorities have privately \ndiscussed scenarios in which Mr. Gulen might be extradited. But several U.S. officials said they cannot now \nenvision a scenario in which they turn him over to Turkey. \n\"It would be unprecedented and appalling if the U.S. took a frail, almost octogenarian, plopped him on a plane \nto go back into that kind of setting with the hideous things that are being said about him by the entire Turkish \ngovernment,\" said Mr. Weingarten. \n\"The bluster, the conspiracy theories, and the threats of Mr. Erdogan are not strong enough to overwhelm the \nAmerican legal system,\" he added. \"And for that reason we believe that Mr. Gulen should not and will not be \nextradited.\" \nMr. Weingarten said the chances that his client helped plot a coup from his base in the Poconos is \"about as \nlikely\" as a meteor striking the lawyer's office while he was speaking. \nWrite to Devlin Barrett at devlin.barrett@wsj.com  \nFrom: Keough, Michael [mailtoliiMINFORMEMI \nSent: Friday, August 05, 2016 1:28 PM \nTo: Will Bohlen \tKing, Kathryn W; Miller, Michael \natelyn Wohlford <1>; \tY.

It has called on the US to \nextradite him. \nMr Gulen denies any involvement. \nTurkey has cracked down heavily in the wake of the coup attempt. On Friday the governing AK Party ordered an internal purge \nof Gulen supporters. \nMore than 270 people died in events surrounding the coup attempt. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 031474 \nSpeaking at a news conference in Washington, Mr Gulen's lawyers said they expected him to remain at the Pennsylvania \ncompound where he lives in self-imposed exile, and not attempt to flee. \nMr Gulen is a reclusive figure who rarely makes contact with the media. \nAlthough Turkey has demanded his extradition, it has yet to make a formal request. \nThe US has said its judiciary will consider a request if and when it is filed. It also asked for evidence of the cleric's involvement \nin the coup attempt, which Turkey says it has supplied. \nMr Gulen's lawyers said it was most unlikely any extradition request would stand up in a US court and almost no chance that \ntheir client would get a fair trial in Turkey, given what had been said against him there since the coup attempt. \nOne of the lawyers, Reid Weingarten, said: \"It would be unprecedented and appalling if the United States took a frail almost-\noctogenarian, plopped him on a plane to go back into that kind of setting with the hideous things that are being said about him \nby the entire Turkish government.\" \nMuch of Turkey's crackdown has targeted perceived supporters of the cleric. \nTens of thousands of public sector workers have been suspended or dismissed, with many having their passports cancelled. \nThere has also been a massive reshuffle of the military. \nAbout 18,000 people have been detained or arrested. \nNow local branches of the AK Party have been told to begin a purge of suspected Gulenists in their ranks. \nMr Gulen had been a close ally of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan until a bitter split between his movement and the party of \nthe president three years ago. \nTurkey has listed Mr Gulen's movement as a terrorist organisation. \nFrom: Will Bohlen \nSent: Friday, August 05, 2016 1:19 PM \nTo: 'Keough, Michael' <11.1=:›; King, Kathryn ; Miller, Michael \nKatelyn Wohlford < ›; Y.

The U.S. \ngovernment has not done so, and the dispute has raised \nquestions about relations between the two allies. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 031476 \nTurkey, a member of the NATO alliance, hosts American troops \nand warplanes at Incirlik Air Base, an important staging area for \nthe U.S.-led fight against Islamic State in Iraq and Syria. \nAt a news conference in Washington, Weingarten and Michael \nMiller, another Steptoe attorney, said evidence from a 2015 \ncase financed by the Turkish government against Gulen in U.S. \nfederal court in Pennsylvania showed that the Turkish \ngovernment relies on dubious proof to make its case against \nhim. \nThat case alleged Gulen issued coded orders to followers in the \nTurkish judiciary in a 2009 sermon to persecute members of \nanother religious sect. It also alleged that the script of a popular \nTurkish television show was laced with follow-up messages. \nThe case was dismissed by a judge in June. \nTurkish government officials, however, say such evidence is \nvalid because Gulen operates covertly and sends encoded \nmessages to his followers. \nTurkey has sent the United States new documents in recent \ndays containing evidence that Turkish authorities say proves the \ncleric was behind the attempted coup. U.S. officials say they are \nlooking through them. \n(Reporting by Julia Harte; Editing by Kevin Drawbaugh and \nJames Dalgleish) \nFrom: Keough, Michael [mailto:  \nSent: Friday, August 05, 2016 1:10 PM \nTo: Will Bohlen .IIIIIM; King, Kathryn< Miller, Michael \nIIMI>; Katelyn Wohlford >; Y.

NSA officers, on the other hand, did not engage in “dangles”\nor even attend diplomatic receptions. They had no reason, other than\na sinister one, to meet with a member of the Russian intelligence\nservice. Furthermore, unlike CIA officers, who, like Nicholson, are\noften posted in neutral countries where they can be approached in a\nsocial context, NSA officers work at well-guarded regional bases and\nare not part of the diplomatic life. Because a known employee of a\nforeign diplomatic mission could not even approach an NSA officer\nwithout arousing suspicion, the SVR would need to use an inter-\nmediary, called an access agent, whose affiliations were not known\n\n© to the FBI. Such an operation would require establishing a network ©\nof illegals in America, as the SVR did after Putin became president.\nEven then, the intermediary would have to find a plausible pretext\nto approach the target without revealing his actual interest. Such\ncomplex operations at the NSA, as far as is known, only yielded a\nfew low-level recruits.\n\nThe emergence of computer networks in the 1990s greatly\nexpanded the SVR’s recruiting horizon. It offered a new penetration\nopportunity at the NSA: civilian technologists working under con-\ntract for the U.S. government. Many of these civilians at the NSA,\nespecially the younger ones, as we know, had been drawn from the\nhacking and game-playing culture; some had even taken courses on\nhacking techniques.

With no early sign, however, of Arafat agreeing to\nleave, Arik now steadily tightened what amounted to a siege on west Beirut. For\nseven weeks in July and August, our forces pounded the PLO-controlled\nneighborhoods from land, air and sea; intermittently cut water and electricity\nsupplies; and hoped that the accumulated pressure, and casualties, would force\nArafat and his men to agree to Habib’s terms for a wholesale evacuation.\n\nBy this point, I was spending most of my time in the Airya, with periodic\nvisits north, sometimes with Arik or Raful, to our positions on the eastern,\nPhalangist-controlled, side of Beirut. On several occasions, I helicoptered back\nwith Habib or his deputy, Morris Draper. In one instance, I accompanied Draper\ninto a meeting with Arik. In what I imagine had become a familiar, and\nfrustrating, part of the US mediation mission, he pressed Arik to rein in our\nbombardments, arguing that we were in danger of ruining the chances of getting\na negotiated deal on Arafat’s leaving. Arik argued straight back. His view was\nthat unless the PLO felt squeezed into submission, they would stay put.\n\nOn that, I thought Ank was probably right. Other Israeli generals with far\nmore experience, and weight, also seemed to agree. Notably, Yitzhak Rabin. He\nwas no longer in government, nor even in charge of Labor. But he had always\nhad a soft spot for Arik, as did Sharon for him. With uneasiness, questions and\noutright criticism of the siege building both internationally and inside Israel,\nArik got Rabin to helicopter north with him to Beirut. Yitzhak spent six or\nseven hours there. His verdict on the siege, at least as reported in the Israeli\npress, was more than Arik could have hoped for. Lehadek, he said. “Tighten it.”\nIn the end, I’m convinced the siege did have a critical effect on getting the\nevacuation deal. But unleashing our single most relentless series of air attacks,\non August 12, when the deal was basically done, seemed both perverse and\nexcessive, and not just to me. Habib, and President Reagan himself, fumed. So\ndid a lot of Begin’s own ministers, with the result, unprecedented in Israeli\nmilitary annals, that they formally removed Arik’s authority to decide on future\nair force missions. That turned out not to matter, however, because August 12\neffectively marked the end of the siege.\n\nOn the afternoon of Saturday, August 21, the first shipload of an eventual\ntotal of nearly 10,000 Palestinian fighters left Beirut harbor for Cyprus, and then\nfor a variety of new host countries. On this score at least, Arik’s grand design\nhad proven beyond him: the Palestinians were not bound for Jordan.

If the president had been\nworried, he was worried no more. Done deal. The White House, having had to sweat\nhardly at all, was about to get a big victory, bragged Kushner, embracing the expected win\nover his dislike of the bill.\n\nThe sudden concern that the outcome might be otherwise began in early March. Katie\nWalsh, who Kushner now described as “demanding and petulant,” began to sound the\nalarm. But her efforts to personally involve the president in vote collecting were blocked\nby Kushner in a set of increasingly tense face-offs. The unraveling had begun.\n\n7 OK Ok\n\nTrump still dismissively called it “the Russian thing—a whole lot of nothing.” But on\nMarch 20, FBI director James Comey appeared before the House Intelligence Committee\nand tied the story up in a neat package:\n\nI have been authorized by the Department of Justice to confirm that the FBI, as part\nof our counterintelligence mission, is investigating the Russian government’s efforts\nto interfere in the 2016 presidential election, and that includes investigating the\nnature of any links between individuals associated with the Trump campaign and\nthe Russian government and whether there was any coordination between the\ncampaign and Russia’s efforts. As with any counter intelligence investigation, this\nwill also include an assessment of whether any crimes were committed. Because it\nis an open, ongoing investigation and is classified I cannot say more about what we\nare doing and whose conduct we are examining.\n\nHe had, however, said quite enough. Comey converted rumor, leaks, theory, innuendo,\nand pundit hot air—and until this moment that was all there was, at best the hope of a\nscandal—into a formal pursuit of the White House. Efforts to pooh-pooh the narrative—\nthe fake news label, the president’s germaphobe defense against the golden shower\naccusations, the haughty dismissal of minor associates and hopeless hangers-on, the\nplaintive, if real, insistence that no crime had even been alleged, and the president’s charge\nthat he was the victim of an Obama wiretap—had failed. Comey himself dismissed the\nwiretap allegation. By the evening of Comey’s appearance, it was evident to everyone that\nthe Russia plot line, far from petering out, had a mighty and bloody life to come.\n\nKushner, ever mindful of his father’s collision with the Justice Department, was\nespecially agitated by Comey’s increasing focus on the White House. Doing something\nabout Comey became a Kushner theme. What can we do about him? was a constant\nquestion. And it was one he kept raising with the president.\n\nYet this was also—as Bannon, without too much internal success, tried to explain—a\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_020009\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

With a multibillion-dollar “black\nbudget” hidden from public scrutiny, the NSA’s technology director-\nate invested in state-of-the-art equipment, including supercomputers\nthat could break almost any cipher, antennas mounted on geosyn-\nchronous satellites that vacuumed in billions of foreign telephone\ncalls, and other exotic capabilities. It also devised stealthy means of\nbreaking into channels that its adversaries believed were secure. This\nenterprise required not only an army of technical specialists capable\nof remotely intercepting even the faintest traces of electromagnetic\nsignals, hacking into computers, and eavesdropping on distant con-\nversations but also special units called “tailored access operations,”\nto plant listening devices in embassies and diplomatic pouches. The\nNSA also organized elaborate expeditions to give access to or even\npenetrate physical cables in enemy territory. In 1971, for example,\nthe NSA sent a specially equipped submarine into Russia’s Sea of\nOkhotsk in Asia to tap through Arctic ice. The target was a Russian\ncable four hundred feet below the surface that connected the Rus-\n© sian naval headquarters in Vladivostok with a missile testing range. ©\n\nIn 1980, President Ronald Reagan gave the NSA a clear mandate\nto expand its interception of foreign communications. In Executive\nOrder 12333, he told the NSA that “all means, consistent with appli-\ncable Federal law and this [Executive] order, and with full consider-\nation of the rights of United States persons, shall be used to obtain\nreliable intelligence information to protect the United States and its\ninterests.” It did not restrict any foreign country, either an adversary\nor an ally, from its surveillance.\n\nThe NSA’s target soon became nothing short of the entire elec-\ntromagnetic spectrum. “We are approaching a time when we will\nbe able to survey almost any point on the earth’s surface with some\nsensor,” Admiral Stansfield Turner, the former director of central\nintelligence, wrote in 1985. “We should soon be able to keep track\nof most of the activities on the surface of the earth.” Bobby Ray\nInman, a former director of the NSA and deputy director of the CIA,\nargued that the “vastness of the [American] intelligence ‘take’ from\nthe Soviet Union, and the pattern of continuity going back years,\n\n| | Epst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.indd 200 ® 9/30/16 8:13AM | |\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_019688\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

The final Senate version was similarly summarized in Tax Bulletin 2017-7. Tax Bulletin 2017-\n8 summarized the reconciled bill agreed to by both chambers.

Stevenson\n\nApril 16, 2011 — The air in the capital these days is thick with\nreferences to trillion-dollar deficits, debt-to-G.D.P. ratios and\nmandatory spending. But the budget debate that became fully\nengaged last week is about far more than accounting and arcane\npolicy disputes. What is under way now is the most fundamental\nreassessment of the size and role of government — of the balance\nbetween personal responsibility and private markets on the one hand\nand public responsibility and social welfare on the other — at least\nsince Ronald Reagan and perhaps since F.D.R.\n\nThe battle ahead “is the big one, and goes to the very major questions\nabout the role of government,” said G. William Hoagland, a former\nRepublican staff director of the Senate Budget Committee. “This is\ngoing to be a very fundamental clash of ideologies.”\n\nThe Democratic and Republican Parties have their own internal\ntensions to address as the debate goes forward in Congress and on the\npresidential campaign trail. But in its early stages at least, it is liberals\nwho are on the defensive.\n\nThe aging of the baby boom generation and the costs of maintaining\nMedicare and Social Security have put the two pillars of the social\nwelfare system on the table for re-examination. The growing weight\nof the national debt has given urgency to the question of whether the\ngovernment has become too big and expensive.\n\nThe tepid nature of the current economic recovery, following big\nstimulus packages, has provided an opening to challenge the\neffectiveness of Keynesianism as the default policy option for\ngovernment.

If Frank was as impressed as I\nwas by the surroundings, you’d never guess it. His only comment concerned the difficulty\nof finding a parking place in front of a “house with no driveway.”\n\nUnlike most theoretical physicists, Frank has long had a keen interest in Al, as\nwitnessed in these three “Observations”’:\n\n1. “Francis Crick called it ‘the Astonishing Hypothesis’: that consciousness, also\nknown as Mind, is an emergent property of matter,” which, if true, indicates that “all\nintelligence is machine intelligence. What distinguishes natural from artificial\nintelligence is not what it is, but only how it is made.”\n\n2. “Artificial intelligence is not the product of an alien invasion. It is an artifact\nof a particular human culture and reflects the values of that culture.”\n\n3. “David Hume's striking statement ‘Reason Is, and Ought only to Be, the Slave\nof the Passions’ was written in 1738 [and] was, of course, meant to apply to human\nreason and human passions. ... But Hume’s logical/philosophical point remains valid\nfor Al. Simply put: Incentives, not abstract logic, drive behavior.”\n\nHe notes that “the big story of the 20th and the 21st century is that [as]\ncomputing develops, we learn how to calculate the consequences of the [fundamental]\nlaws better and better. There’s also a feedback cycle: When you understand matter\nbetter, you can design better computers, which will enable you to calculate better. It’s\nkind of an ascending helix.”\n\nHere he argues that human intelligence, for now, holds the advantage—yet our\nfuture, unbounded by our solar system and doubtless also by our galaxy, will never be\nrealized without the help of our AIs.\n\n55\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_016858\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

This is a critical issue, as many criminal\ncases may never proceed to formal charging. If crime victims have no\nrights during criminal investigations, then many crime victims will never\nhave any rights at all.\nThe issue of whether crime victims have rights in the criminal justice\nprocess recently came to a head when the Justice Department released a\nmemorandum contending that the CVRA does not extend crime victims any\nrights until prosecutors choose to file formal criminal charges. This led the\nCVRA’s Senate cosponsor, then-Senator Jon Kyl, to fire off an angry letter\nto the Justice Department attacking its position. In our Article, we side\nwith the Act’s cosponsor. We believe that, properly understood, the CVRA\ndoes extend crime victims’ rights during criminal investigations.\nOur Article proceeds in four parts.

Many of these rights apply\nonly after the filing of criminal charges, such as the victim’s right to be\nheard during court proceedings. A crime victim’s right to deliver an impact\nstatement at sentencing, for instance, can only be exercised after a\nprosecutor has filed charges against a defendant and obtained a conviction.\nOther rights, however, can apply even before the formal filing of charges.\nAs one example, the Crime Victims’ Rights Act (CVRA) 1 extends to\nfederal crime victims the right to “confer” with prosecutors. But can\nvictims exercise this right before charges have been filed?\nThis question has tremendous practical importance. In many cases,\nprosecutors negotiate pleas well before any charges are ever drafted. If\ncrime victims’ rights enactments do not extend rights to victims until the\nformal filing of charges, then crime victims can be effectively excluded\nfrom the plea bargaining process. Yet the exclusion of victims in early\nstages of a criminal case affects more than just the content of a plea deal.\nCrime victims will also lose other important rights in the process if the\nformal filing of charges is the necessary trigger for those rights. If, for\nexample, prosecutors work out a nonprosecution agreement with an\noffender, they need not notify his victims of what they are doing or of the\nfact that potential charges will never be filed.\nThe issue of pre-charging rights has most prominently surfaced in\nconnection with federal cases. In 2010, the Department of Justice’s Office\nof Legal Counsel (OLC) weighed in on the issue and released a legal\nopinion arguing that victims of federal crimes have no CVRA rights during\na federal criminal investigation. 2 The Justice Department took the position\nthat rights under the CVRA do not apply until prosecutors formally initiate\ncriminal proceedings by filing a complaint, information, or indictment. The\nDepartment claims to find support for that limiting interpretation of the\nstatute in its plain language and legislative history.\nShortly after the Department released its opinion, one of the CVRA’s\ncongressional sponsors, then-Senator Jon Kyl, sent a letter to Attorney\nGeneral Eric Holder strenuously objecting to the Department’s conclusions.\nSenator Kyl directly stated his view that “[w]hen Congress enacted the\n1 Scott Campbell, Stephanie Roper, Wendy Preston, Louarna Gillis, and Nila Lynn\nCrime Victims’ Rights Act, Pub.

[Vol. 104\nCVRA, it intended to protect crime victims throughout the criminal justice\nprocess—from the investigative phases to the final conclusion of a case.” 3\nSenator Kyl contested the Department’s analysis of the statute and, in\nparticular, its use of statements from him during Congress’s consideration\nof the CVRA.\nThis Article sides with the CVRA’s cosponsor and concludes that\ncrime victims’ CVRA rights attach before formal charging. Both the\nCVRA’s plain language and its legislative history lead inexorably to this\nconclusion, as every court that has considered this issue has concluded.\nThis Article also contends that, as a matter of sound public policy, crime\nvictims should have rights before the formal filing of criminal charges.\nThis Article proceeds in four parts. Part I frames the issues under\ndiscussion by defending the importance of extending rights to crime victims\nduring criminal investigations. Part I also provides background on victims’\nrights and gives a concrete illustration of a case in which the question of\npre-charging rights for crime victims has arisen—specifically, the Jeffrey\nEpstein sex abuse case before a federal court in Florida. In that case, girls\nvictimized by Epstein have argued that they should have been consulted\nabout a federal nonprosecution agreement; Department attorneys have\nresponded that because prosecutors never filed charges, government\nofficials had no formal obligations to inform the girls.\nPart II reviews the CVRA’s purpose, text, structure, and legislative\nhistory. This review establishes that the CVRA extends rights to crime\nvictims before formal charges are filed.\nPart III critiques OLC’s position that the CVRA extends rights to\nvictims only after prosecutors have lodged charges in court. The\nDepartment’s proffered arguments do not withstand close scrutiny,\nparticularly in light of the fact that the CVRA covers federal agencies\ninvolved in the “detection” and “investigation” of crime, 4 and specifically\nauthorizes crime victims to file CVRA motions in situations where “no\nprosecution is underway.” 5\nPart IV then proposes a specific approach for determining when crime\nvictims’ CVRA rights attach. This Part explains that the rights should\nattach when federal law enforcement or prosecuting agencies have\nidentified a federal crime and a particular victim with sufficient precision\nthat they would send a “target” letter to a criminal defendant in similar\ncircumstances. If prosecutors have sufficient information to provide notice\n3 Letter from Jon Kyl, U.S. Sen., to Eric H. Holder, Jr., Att’y Gen. (June 6, 2011),\nreprinted in 157 CONG. REC. S3608 (daily ed.

Jon Kyl).\n4 18 U.S.C. § 3771(c)(1).\n5 Id. § 3771(d)(3).\n2014] CRIME VICTIMS’ RIGHTS 63\nto a potential criminal of his rights, they can do the same for his victims.\nThis Part also notes that the Department of Justice and state prosecutors\nalready successfully provide rights to victims before charging. This\nsuccessful experience strongly suggests that providing rights to victims\nearly in the criminal justice process will not be unduly burdensome.\nI. THE ISSUE OF RIGHTS FOR CRIME VICTIMS DURING CRIMINAL\nINVESTIGATIONS\nTo consider the question of whether victims should have rights during\ncriminal investigations, some understanding of the underlying purposes of\nvictims’ rights enactments will be useful. These enactments are typically\ndesigned to make victims participants in all phases of the criminal justice\nprocess. 6 Congress drafted the CVRA, for example, broadly to make crime\nvictims participants in criminal cases. The Jeffrey Epstein sex abuse case\ndemonstrates the importance of victim participation even before charges are\nfiled.\nA. A BRIEF HISTORY OF CRIME VICTIMS’ RIGHTS\nThe crime victims’ rights movement has sought to make crime victims\nimportant participants in the criminal justice process. The movement began\nin the wake of the Warren Court revolution, which extended new rights to\ncriminal defendants. 7 With the courts paying increasing attention to\ncriminal defendants, crime victims’ advocates began to argue that the\nvictims themselves had been overlooked. 8 The movement gained great\nvisibility in the early 1980s when President Ronald Reagan appointed the\nPresident’s Task Force on Victims of Crime. 9 The Task Force published a\nreport concluding that “the criminal justice system has lost an essential\nbalance. . . . The victims of crime have been transformed into a group\noppressively burdened by a system designed to protect them. This\noppression must be redressed.” 10\nThe Task Force chronicled how crime victims were treated in all\nstages of the criminal justice process, from the police investigation through\n6 See DOUGLAS E. BELOOF, PAUL G. CASSELL & STEVEN J. TWIST, VICTIMS IN CRIMINAL\nPROCEDURE 3–39 (3d ed. 2010) (describing reforms from a historical perspective); see also,\ne.g., 18 U.S.C. § 3771(a) (2012).\n7 See BELOOF, CASSELL & TWIST, supra note 6, at 3–39 (describing the history of\nvictims’ rights in American law and the early days of the modern movement).\n8 See, e.g., William F.

[Vol. 104\ncourt proceedings, and ultimately to any parole or other release of the\ncriminal. The Task Force then made a series of recommendations for all\ncriminal justice agencies, including the police, prosecutors, and the courts. 11\nThe recommendations were designed to allow crime victims to receive\ninformation about, and to participate in, criminal cases.\nIn its most far-reaching recommendation, the Task Force proposed\namending the U.S. Constitution to protect victims’ rights. 12 The proposed\namendment would have built on existing constitutional rights for criminal\ndefendants by extending similar rights to crime victims. 13\nAfter the publication of the report, crime victims’ advocates secured\nthe passage of a series of state constitutional and legislative reforms. These\nmeasures guaranteed victims’ rights in the criminal process, such as the\nright to be notified of court proceedings, to attend those proceedings, and to\nspeak at appropriate points in the process, such as plea bargaining and\nsentencing. The measures were embodied in state statutes and, in more\nthan thirty states, state constitutional “bills of rights” for crime victims. 14\nWhile many of the measures had narrow participatory rights, 15 some of the\namendments also contained more open-ended language, promising victims\na right to fair treatment “throughout the criminal justice process.” 16\nAfter successfully passing many state constitutional amendments,\ncrime victims’ rights advocates sought to achieve the Task Force’s broadest\nrecommendation: to secure protection for victims’ rights in the U.S.\nConstitution. In 1996, victims’ advocates proposed a Victims’ Rights\nAmendment in a Rose Garden ceremony attended by President Bill\nClinton. 17 The proposed amendment contained a list of rights for crime\nvictims, largely paralleling the rights contained in state victims’ rights\n11 See id. at 56–82.\n12 Id. at 114.\n13 Id. at 114–15.\n14 For a map depicting the states with (and without) such amendments, see State Victim\nRights Amendments, NAT’L VICTIMS’ CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT PASSAGE,\nhttp://goo.gl/znI4YW (last visited Nov. 26, 2013); for discussion, see infra Part IV.D\n(discussing legislative reforms in a number of states).\n15 See, e.g., CAL.

THE CRIME VICTIMS’ RIGHTS ACT\nUnable to obtain the necessary supermajority to pass a federal\nconstitutional amendment, in April 2004, crime victims’ rights advocates\ndecided to focus on federal legislation protecting crime victims. In\nexchange for backing off from their efforts to pass a constitutional\namendment, crime victims’ advocates received near-universal congressional\nsupport for a “broad and encompassing” statutory victims’ bill of rights. 21\nVictims’ advocates sought to expand on the protections found in other\npreviously-enacted victims’ rights statutes, including, notably, the Victims’\nRights and Restitution Act of 1990. 22 That statute had also included a bill\nof rights for crime victims, yet because of limited enforcement mechanisms,\ncrime victims had been unable to secure court protection of the rights listed\nin the statute. 23\nThe statute that Congress passed to solve these problems—the Crime\nVictims’ Rights Act of 2004—gave victims “the right to participate in the\n18 See Cassell, supra note 17, at 848–49.

The first was simply to ensure that crime victims understood what\nwas happening in the criminal justice process. This goal is apparent from\nthe fact that the CVRA gives crime victims rights to notification about\nvarious court hearings, as well as more general rights to confer with\nprosecutors and to be treated with fairness. 30 The CVRA’s Senate sponsors\nexplained:\nIn case after case we found victims, and their families, were ignored, cast aside, and\ntreated as non-participants in a critical event in their lives. They were kept in the dark\nby prosecutors to[o] busy to care enough, by judges focused on [defendants’] rights,\nand by a court system that simply did not have a place for them. 31\nIn passing the CVRA, Congress sought to change the system’s\nobliviousness to crime victims that often “left crime victims and their\nfamilies victimized yet again.” 32\nA second overarching purpose of the CVRA was to allow crime\nvictims to play a role in the criminal justice process. Through the CVRA,\nCongress intended to make victims “independent participant[s]” in the\ncriminal justice process. 33 The CVRA extends to crime victims a series of\n“rights” in the criminal justice process—rights that the victims have\n24 150 CONG.

Congress clearly thought that such\nparticipation was valuable in its own right. Senator Kyl embodied this\nbelief and explained his decision to become involved in the crime victims’\nrights movement because of his discovery that victims:\nwere suffering through the trauma of the victimization and then being thrown into a\nsystem which they did not understand, which nobody was helping them with, and\nwhich literally prevented them from participation in any meaningful way. I came to\nrealize there were literally millions of people out there being denied these basic\nrights . . . . 36\nBut Congress also thought crime victim participation in the criminal\njustice system could be instrumentally useful. For example, in protecting a\nvictim’s right to be heard by those determining a defendant’s sentence, a\nvictim might be able to provide important information that could alter that\nsentence. As a result, the sentence might reflect a fuller appreciation of the\ndanger posed by a defendant, and the judge might take appropriate steps to\nprevent others from being victimized. 37\nCongress also intended to ensure that crime victims were not\nrevictimized in the criminal justice process—that is, that they would not\nsuffer what scholars have called “secondary harm” in the process. 38 The\nconcern is that victims suffer when they are excluded from the criminal\njustice process. Congress sought to end that suffering by making victims\nmeaningful participants in criminal cases. 39\nC. AN ILLUSTRATION OF THE PRE-CHARGING ISSUE: THE JEFFREY\nEPSTEIN CASE\nGiven the potentially expansive scope of victims’ rights under both\nstate provisions and the CVRA, a critical question arises about how to apply\nthem: Do the rights come into existence only after prosecutors formally file\n34 Compare 18 U.S.C. § 3771(d), with Susan Bandes, Victim Standing, 1999 UTAH L.

To the\ncontrary, even after the nonprosecution agreement had been signed, the\nOffice continued to tell the victims that the case was still “under\ninvestigation” and that they should be “patien[t].” 46 When the victims\nlearned of the agreement, two of them (Jane Doe Number One and Jane\nDoe Number Two) filed suit in federal court under the Crime Victims’\nRights Act, arguing that the prosecutors had violated their CVRA right to\nconfer as well as their right to be treated fairly. 47 The victims contended\nthat prosecutors should have conferred with them about the nonprosecution\nagreement before it became final.\nIn response, the U.S. Attorney’s Office argued primarily that it was\nunder no obligation to extend the victims any rights under the CVRA. It\nwas the Government’s blunt position that “CVRA rights do not attach in the\nabsence of federal criminal charges filed by a federal prosecutor.” 48 In\nshort, the Government argued it was not required to confer in any way with\nthe victims, or even treat them fairly, because the CVRA was not yet in\nplay. The issue is thus squarely framed: Is the Government correct in its\nassertion that it has no CVRA obligations in cases like the Epstein case\nwhere federal prosecutors never lodged federal charges against a suspect?\nIn view of the CVRA’s prominence, resolution of this issue may shed\nimportant light on the nature of crime victims’ enactments and the breadth\nof the role that crime victims should have in the criminal justice process.\nII. THE CVRA’S APPLICATION BEFORE FORMAL CHARGES ARE FILED\nTo analyze the issue of whether the CVRA extends rights to crime\nvictims before prosecutors have formally filed charges, it is useful to look at\nthe CVRA’s purposes, language, and judicial interpretations. This Part\nlooks at each of these three issues in turn.\n45 See Michele Dargan, Feds Say They Treated Epstein Victims Fairly, PALM BEACH\nDAILY NEWS (Apr. 8, 2011, 7:23 PM), http://goo.gl/rTGDed; Conchita Sarnoff, Billionaire\nPedophile Goes Free, DAILY BEAST (July 20, 2010, 7:05 PM), http://goo.gl/MSTi17.\n46 See Jane Doe Motion, supra note 40, at 14, 16 (internal quotation marks and citations\nomitted).\n47 See Emergency Victim’s Petition for Enforcement of Crime Victim’s Rights Act, 18\nU.S.C.

THE CVRA’S PURPOSES\nAn analysis of the CVRA’s application before prosecutors have filed\ncharges must begin by assessing the CVRA’s purposes because any\ninterpretation of the CVRA that is divorced from the statute’s purposes\nwould run the risk of defeating the statute’s aims. It is axiomatic that courts\nshould “give faithful meaning to the language Congress adopted in the light\nof the evident legislative purpose in enacting the law in question.” 49\nAs discussed above, 50 one important goal of the CVRA was to keep\ncrime victims informed about any developments in the criminal justice\nprocess. But the need to be informed does not begin with the filing of a\nformal criminal charge. A crime victim needs to know what is happening\nbefore formal charging—during a criminal investigation, for example—just\nas much as she needs to know what is happening in court. Indeed, she may\nhave a greater need to know, as she may be concerned that the criminal who\nharmed her is still on the loose, posing a danger to her.\nSimilarly, concerning the second purpose—facilitating victim\nparticipation 51 —without a right to pre-charging involvement, victims may\nbe effectively shut out of the process entirely. The Epstein case provides a\nuseful illustration of why the CVRA must be understood to extend rights to\nvictims prior to indictment. The prosecutors handling the investigation\nreached an agreement with Epstein that barred federal prosecution of sex\noffenses committed against dozens of victims, including Jane Doe Number\nOne and Jane Doe Number Two. If CVRA rights did not extend to the\nnegotiations surrounding the agreement, then the victims never would have\nhad any ability to participate in the resolution of the case. 52\nA construction of the CVRA that extends rights to victims before\ncharges are filed would be entirely consistent with the CVRA’s\nparticipatory purpose. If victims have the ability to participate in a precharging\nplea bargaining process, for example, victims can help ensure that\nprosecutors do not overlook anything that should be covered in the plea\ndeal. For example, victims might be able to obtain agreement to a “no\ncontact” order or valuable restitution—points that the prosecutor might fail\n49 Graham Cnty. Soil & Water Conservation Dist. v. United States ex rel. Wilson, 130 S.\nCt. 1396, 1409 (2010) (quoting United States v. Bornstein, 423 U.S. 303, 310 (1976))\n(internal quotation marks omitted).\n50 See supra notes 24–27.\n51 See supra notes 28–29.\n52 Even the Justice Department seems to recognize this point. As a matter of policy, the\nDepartment extends to victims the right to confer with prosecutors in situations where plea\ndiscussions occur before charges have been brought. U.S. DEP’T OF JUSTICE, OFFICE FOR\nVICTIMS OF CRIME, ATTORNEY GENERAL GUIDELINES FOR VICTIM AND WITNESS ASSISTANCE\n41–42 (2011 ed., rev. May 2012) [hereinafter ATTORNEY GENERAL GUIDELINES].\n2014] CRIME VICTIMS’ RIGHTS 71\nto consider in crafting a plea. Similarly, allowing victims to participate\nearly in the process avoids retraumatizing victims. Again, as the Epstein\ncase usefully illustrates, it may be extremely difficult for victims to\ndiscover after the fact that potential criminal charges against a criminal who\nhas abused them have been secretly bargained away. Jane Doe Number\nOne and Jane Doe Number Two, for example, were outraged when they\ndiscovered prosecutors had entered into an agreement blocking any\nprosecution of sex offenses Epstein committed against them—and all\nwithout telling them. 53\nIn short, the purposes animating the CVRA all suggest that the Act\nwas meant to, and should, extend rights to crime victims before formal\ncharges are filed.\nB. THE CVRA’S PLAIN LANGUAGE\nWhile the general purposes of the CVRA support a broad\ninterpretation of the Act, it is important to examine whether those purposes\nhave been expressed in the Act’s language. Without a linkage to the Act’s\ntext, the general purpose might not provide a sound basis for\ninterpretation. 54 But the CVRA’s plain language makes clear that Congress\nintended for the law to provide at least some rights to crime victims\nthroughout the criminal justice process, even before the filing of criminal\ncharges.\nAccording to its text, the CVRA provides eight specifically\nenumerated rights for crime victims and an additional right to be reasonably\nnotified of these rights. 55 Some of these rights presuppose the formal filing\nof criminal charges. For instance, the CVRA extends to victims the “right\nto reasonable, accurate, and timely notice of any public court proceeding.” 56\nThat particular right obviously does not apply before charges are filed, as\nno “court proceedings” exist before a defendant is charged.\nBut the CVRA also promises crime victims rights that are not\nspecifically tied to court proceedings. Perhaps most expansively, the\nCVRA guarantees victims the “right to be treated with fairness and with\n53 Without disclosing confidential attorney–client communications, this fact is readily\napparent from victims’ filings in the Epstein case. See, e.g., Jane Doe Motion, supra note 40, at\n17 (stating that the victims relied on the U.S. Attorney’s Office representatives “to their\ndetriment[,]” that if they knew the true facts, “they would have taken steps to object” to the plea\nagreement, and that they believed criminal prosecution to be “extremely important”).\n54 See ANTONIN SCALIA & BRYAN A. GARNER, READING LAW: THE INTERPRETATION OF\nLEGAL TEXTS 56 (2012).\n55 18 U.S.C. § 3771(a) (2012) (enumerating eight rights); id. § 3771(c)(1) (requiring\ngovernment officers use “their best efforts” to notify victims of their rights).\n56 Id. § 3771(a)(2).\n72 CASSELL ET AL. [Vol. 104\nrespect for the victim’s dignity and privacy,” 57 a broad right that does not\nappear to be directly linked to a filed court case. Similarly, the CVRA\npromises victims the “reasonable right to confer with the attorney for the\nGovernment in the case.” 58 In this section, the CVRA’s drafters appear to\nhave eschewed a reference to court proceedings, using a broader term\ninstead. Of course, a “case” can refer both to a judicial case before a court\nand an investigative case pursued by a law enforcement officer. It is\ncommon usage to say such things as, “The police officer investigated and\nsolved the case.” Dictionary definitions of the word “case” support this\nvaried interpretation. 59\nIf there remained any doubts about whether the CVRA applies during\nthe investigative part of the criminal justice process, two other provisions in\nthe CVRA resolve them. The CVRA specifically directs that “[o]fficers\nand employees of the Department of Justice and other departments and\nagencies of the United States engaged in the detection, investigation, or\nprosecution of crime shall make their best efforts to see that crime victims\nare notified of, and accorded, the rights described in [the CVRA].” 60 Of\ncourse, there would be no reason to direct that agencies involved in the\n“detection” and “investigation” of crime have CVRA obligations if the Act\ndid not extend to pre-charging situations. Congress thus directly envisioned\nthe victims’ rights law to apply during the “detection” and “investigation”\nphases of criminal cases.\nSimilarly, the CVRA’s venue provision instructs that crime victims\nwho seek to assert rights in pre-charging situations should proceed in the\ncourt where the crime was committed: “The rights described in subsection\n(a) [of the CVRA] shall be asserted in the district court in which a\ndefendant is being prosecuted for the crime or, if no prosecution is\nunderway, in the district court in the district in which the crime occurred.” 61\nHere again, it is hard to see why this provision would be necessary unless\nthe CVRA applies before the formal filing of charges.\nFor all these reasons, the CVRA’s plain language indicates that the\nvictims have protected rights under the Act even before charges are filed.\n57 Id. § 3771(a)(8).\n58 Id. § 3771(a)(5) (emphasis added).\n59 See, e.g., BLACK’S LAW DICTIONARY 243–44 (9th ed. 2009) (defining, among the\ndefinitions of “case,” a “test case” as “[a] criminal investigation” as in “the Manson case”);\nWEBSTER’S THIRD NEW INTERNATIONAL DICTIONARY OF THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE\nUNABRIDGED 345 (1993) (defining “case” as “a circumstance or situation (as a crime)\nrequiring investigation or action by the police or other agency”).\n60 18 U.S.C. § 3771(c)(1) (emphasis added).\n61 Id. § 3771(d)(3) (emphasis added).\n2014] CRIME VICTIMS’ RIGHTS 73\nC. COURTS RECOGNIZE THAT CRIME VICTIMS HAVE CVRA RIGHTS\nBEFORE CHARGING\nBecause crime victims lack a right to appointed counsel, many victims\nhave difficulty litigating the scope of their rights. 62 But in a few cases,\nvictims have been able to secure counsel to argue that they have rights in\nthe criminal justice process during the investigation of federal crimes.\nWhen those cases have reached the issue of whether the CVRA applies\nbefore charges have been filed, courts have uniformly agreed with the\nvictims’ position.\nPerhaps the leading case to date to assess this question is the Fifth\nCircuit’s decision in In re Dean. 63 There, a wealthy corporate criminal\ndefendant reached a generous plea deal with the Government—a deal that\nthe Government filed for approval with the district court without conferring\nwith the victims. Citing procedural rights under the CVRA, the victims\nrequested that the trial court reject the plea agreement. 64 The District Court\nfor the Southern District of Texas specifically concluded that victims’\nCVRA rights could apply during the investigation of the crime: “There are\nclearly rights under the CVRA that apply before any prosecution is\nunderway.” 65 The district court concluded, however, that the Government\nhad not violated the CVRA because it had secured judicial permission to\ndispense with notification to victims. 66\nThe victims sought appellate review in the Fifth Circuit. 67 There, the\ncourt concurred with the district court that CVRA rights apply before trial.\nUnlike the district court, however, it held that the Government had violated\nthe victims’ rights:\nThe district court acknowledged that “[t]here are clearly rights under the CVRA that\napply before any prosecution is underway.” Logically, this includes the CVRA’s\nestablishment of victims’ “reasonable right to confer with the attorney for the\nGovernment.” At least in the posture of this case (and we do not speculate on the\n62 John W.

[Vol. 104\napplicability to other situations), the government should have fashioned a reasonable\nway to inform the victims of the likelihood of criminal charges and to ascertain the\nvictims’ views on the possible details of a plea bargain. 68\nThe Fifth Circuit then remanded the matter to the district court to determine\nthe appropriate remedy for the violation of the victims’ rights. 69\nThe Fifth Circuit’s decision in Dean has been cited favorably in four\nrecent district court decisions, which provides further support for the\nconclusion that the CVRA applies before charges have been filed. In\nUnited States v. Rubin, 70 victims of a federal securities fraud argued that\nthey had CVRA rights even before prosecutors filed a superseding\nindictment covering the specific crimes affecting the victims. Citing Dean,\nthe District Court for the Eastern District of New York agreed that the\nrights were expansive and could apply before charges were filed but were\nsubject to the outer limit that the Government has at least “contemplated”\ncharges. 71\nSimilarly, in United States v. Oakum, 72 the District Court for the\nEastern District of Virginia considered a claim that CVRA rights did not\napply until after a defendant had been convicted. In rejecting that\nargument, the court agreed with the Dean court that victims acquire rights\neven before a prosecution begins. 73\nThe District Court for the Northern District of Indiana held to the same\neffect in In re Petersen. 74 There, the court held that a victim’s right to be\ntreated with fairness and with respect for [his or her] dignity and privacy\n“may apply before any prosecution is underway and isn’t necessarily tied to\na ‘court proceeding’ or ‘case.’” 75 The court, however, found that the\n“conclusory allegations” in the victims’ petition did not “create a plausible\nclaim for relief under the CVRA.” 76\n68 In re Dean, 527 F.3d at 394 (internal citations omitted).\n69 Id. at 396.

But the authorities Petersen cites for that\nproposition prove no such thing. Confusingly, Petersen cited the Fifth Circuit’s ruling in\n2014] CRIME VICTIMS’ RIGHTS 75\nPerhaps the most extensive discussion of this issue has come from the\nEpstein case discussed earlier. 77 Overruling the Government’s argument\nthat the CVRA only applies after the formal filing of charges, Does v.\nUnited States held that “the statutory language clearly contemplates precharge\nproceedings.” 78 The court in Does explained that “[c]ourt\nproceedings involving the crime are not limited to post-complaint or postindictment\nproceedings, but can also include initial appearances and bond\nhearings, both of which can take place before a formal charge.” 79 The court\nalso noted that the CVRA’s “requirement that officials engaged in\n‘detection [or] investigation’ [of crimes] afford victims the rights\nenumerated in subsection (a) surely contemplates pre-charge application of\nthe CVRA.” 80 Finally, the court in Does noted that “[i]f the CVRA’s rights\nmay be enforced before a prosecution is underway, then, to avoid a strained\nreading of the statute, those rights must attach before a complaint or\nindictment formally charges the defendant with the crime.” 81\nIn sum, the relevant case law unanimously agrees that the CVRA\nextends rights to crime victims before charges have been filed.\nIII. THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT’S UNPERSUASIVE POSITION\nDespite the CVRA’s broad remedial purposes, its expansive language\nreferring to investigations, and the unanimous case law extending rights to\nvictims prior to defendants being charged, the OLC released a\nmemorandum in 2011 concluding that CVRA rights attach only “from the\ntime that criminal proceedings are initiated (by complaint, information, or\nindictment).” 82 OLC’s analysis is unpersuasive. Although OLC’s opinion\nDean for support; but (as just explained above) Dean held exactly the opposite. Similarly,\nPetersen cites other cases involving the right to confer after charges have been filed. Id. But\nnone of these cases actually presented the issue of the CVRA’s application to pre-indictment\nsituations, since charges had already been filed in each of these cases.

Recently, the district court in the Does case also rejected Government efforts to\ndismiss the action. The district court found that, if the victims could prove the factual\nallegations they have made, then they would be entitled to relief, including potentially the\nrelief of invalidating the nonprosecution agreement that Epstein obtained from the\nGovernment.

[Vol. 104\ninvokes the CVRA’s definition of crime “victim,” its legislative intent, and\nits structure, a closer reading of each demonstrates little support for the\nnotion that crime victims must await the formal filing of charges before\naccruing CVRA rights.\nA. OLC’S MISREADING OF THE CVRA’S DEFINITION OF “VICTIM”\nOLC’s lead argument is that the CVRA’s definition of “victim”\npresupposes that criminal charges have been formally filed. 83 The CVRA\ndefines a “victim” who is protected as “a person directly and proximately\nharmed as a result of the commission of a Federal offense.” 84 Focusing on\nthe word “offense,” OLC concedes that it does not “conclusively resolve”\nthe question of when rights attach. Nevertheless, OLC claims that the word\n“naturally suggests that a person’s status as a ‘crime victim’ can only be\ndetermined after there has been a formal decision to charge a defendant\nwith a particular Federal offense.” 85 OLC goes on to elaborate:\nUnder this reading, the earliest that a “crime victim” under the Act could be identified\nwould be upon the filing of a criminal complaint—that is, at the earliest point at which\nthere is a sworn written statement of probable cause to believe that a particular\ndefendant committed an identified Federal offense and hence the first point at which it\nis possible with any certainty to identify a “crime victim” directly and proximately\nharmed by the commission of that offense. 86\nOLC is disingenuous in asserting that the “first point” at which a\nperson has been harmed by a federal crime arises only after a criminal\ncomplaint has been filed. The Department routinely makes such\ndeterminations at earlier points in criminal cases, such as when it sends a\n“target letter” to a defense attorney during a grand jury investigation. 87\nIndeed, OLC remarkably ignores the fact that the Department is directly\nrequired to identify victims of a crime before the filing of a criminal\ncomplaint, both by statute and through internal policy directives.\nThe Victims’ Rights and Restitution Act of 1990 (VRRA) 88 requires\nthe Department to identify victims before the filing of a criminal complaint.\n83 OLC CVRA Rights Memo, supra note 2, at 6.\n84 18 U.S.C. § 3771(e) (2012) (emphasis added).\n85 OLC CVRA Rights Memo, supra note 2, at 5.\n86 Id.\n87 A target letter explains the procedural process underlying an indictment and places the\ndefendant on notice of the general nature of the government’s criminal investigation.

L. No. 101-647, 104 Stat. 4820 (codified as amended at 42 U.S.C. §§ 10601,\n10606–07 (2006)).\n2014] CRIME VICTIMS’ RIGHTS 77\nPassed in 1990, the VRRA provided crime victims with a set of procedural\nrights similar to those found in the CVRA, along with rights to notification\nabout victim services. 89 In 2004, the CVRA repealed and replaced the\nsection of the VRRA listing procedural rights, while leaving other parts of\nthe VRRA intact. 90 Under the remaining parts of the VRRA, the Justice\nDepartment must inform victims of federal crimes of services that are\navailable to them, including “emergency medical and social services,”\ncounseling, and support. 91 The Department is further obligated to keep\nvictims fully informed about “the status of the investigation of the crime, to\nthe extent it is appropriate to inform the victim and to the extent that it will\nnot interfere with the investigation.” 92 These rights to notice about\n“emergency medical and social services” 93 as well as to the “status of the\ninvestigation of the crime” 94 obviously require the Department to identify\nvictims of federal crimes before formal charges have been filed. Indeed, the\nVRRA makes this point clear by directing the Department to not only notify\nthe victim about the status of the investigation but also about the later\n“filing of charges against a suspected offender.” 95 The VRRA then extends\nvictims’ rights to information through the rest of the criminal justice\nprocess by requiring the Department to provide notice to victims of such\nthings as the imposed sentence and the defendant’s release. 96\nThe VRRA not only requires the Department to identify victims during\nthe investigation of a crime, it also defines those victims in a very similar\nfashion to the CVRA. The VRRA defines “victim” as a “person that has\nsuffered direct physical, emotional, or pecuniary harm as a result of the\ncommission of a crime.” 97 Thus, the Department is already routinely\nidentifying persons who have been “harmed” by federal crimes shortly after\nthe commission of those crimes and well before formal charging.\nThe Attorney General has also promulgated internal guidelines\nrequiring Justice Department components to identify victims rapidly after a\ncrime. The Attorney General Guidelines for Victim and Witness Assistance\nprovide that “Department responsibilities to crime victims begin as soon as\npossible after the detection of a crime at which they may be undertaken\n89 See supra notes 22–23 and accompanying text.\n90 Justice for All Act of 2004, Pub.

[Vol. 104\nwithout interfering in the investigation. Generally, this point in time is\ndefined by the opening of a criminal investigation.” 98\nGiven the way the two statutes work, it would make no sense to\nartificially confine the CVRA’s reach until after the filing of a criminal\ncomplaint. Before then, victims will have often received information from\nthe Department about the status of the investigation. They might wish to\nconfer with prosecutors about how the case is proceeding, and the CVRA\nextends to them a right to confer. 99 Similarly, while the Department is\nnotifying victims about the services they may receive and the status of an\ninvestigation, it is important that the victims be treated fairly. The CVRA\nextends the right to be treated fairly. 100 Indeed, it would be absurd to think\nthat Congress wanted to permit the Justice Department to treat crime\nvictims unfairly until criminal charges have been filed.\nInstead of recognizing Congress’s intent, OLC’s 2011 memorandum\nsimply cites to a series of cases in which courts concluded that a victim of\nuncharged conduct should not be afforded statutory protections. 101 Yet\nnone of these cases—United States v. Turner, 102 Searcy v. Paletz, 103 or\nSearcy v. Skinner 104 —provide strong support for OLC’s position. Turner is\na particularly poor fit. Although OLC’s memorandum characterizes Turner\nas excluding victims of uncharged conduct, 105 the magistrate judge adopted\nan inclusive reading of the statute precisely because of his reservations\nabout the CVRA’s legislative history and plain language. The judge\nsuggested that “any person who self-identifies as [a victim]” could be\npresumed to qualify for protection under the CVRA as a preliminary\nmatter. 106 In fact, the line quoted by the Department is lifted out of context.\nThe full sentence reads: “While the offense charged against a defendant can\n98 ATTORNEY GENERAL GUIDELINES, supra note 52, at 7 (internal citations omitted); see\nalso 42 U.S.C. § 10607(b).\n99 18 U.S.C. § 3771(a)(5) (2012) (preserving “[t]he reasonable right to confer with the\nattorney for the Government in the case”).\n100 Id. § 3771(a)(8) (preserving “[t]he right to be treated with fairness and with respect\nfor the victim’s dignity and privacy”).\n101 OLC CVRA Rights Memo, supra note 2, at 6 n.6.\n102 367 F.

In Skinner, a prison inmate attempted to bring a pro\nse civil suit against another inmate for allegedly attacking him during\nincarceration. 108 In dismissing the suit in an unpublished decision, the\ndistrict court recognized that the Government had expressly declined to\nbring charges against the other inmate and concluded that the CVRA did\nnot create a “mechanism to bring an action against Defendant directly.” 109\nIn Paletz, that same inmate brought a similar pro se claim against another\ninmate, the Federal Bureau of Prisons, the FBI, and the U.S. Attorney\nGeneral. 110 In a parallel, unpublished decision, the district court dismissed\nthe suit, noting that the CVRA is designed to give victims certain rights\n“within the prosecutorial process against a criminal defendant.” 111\nBecause Skinner and Paletz involve (apparently frivolous) civil suits,\nthey say nothing about the CVRA’s reach in criminal cases, and any\nlanguage to that effect would be pure dicta.

OLC’S DISTORTION OF THE CVRA’S STRUCTURE AND LEGISLATIVE\nHISTORY\nThe next section of OLC’s memorandum maintains that the CVRA’s\nstructure and legislative history lead to the conclusion that the CVRA is\n“best understood” as extending rights after charges have been filed. Here\nagain, OLC’s analysis is truncated at best and misleading at worst.\nOLC begins this part of its analysis by observing that some of the\nrights in the CVRA are limited to court proceedings. OLC notes, for\nexample, that the CVRA gives victims the “right to reasonable, accurate,\nand timely notice of any public court proceeding . . . involving the\ncrime.” 117 But the fact that some of the rights listed in the CVRA apply to\ncourt proceedings hardly means that all of the rights are to be so restricted.\nThe federal criminal justice process includes stages that are pre-charging,\npost-charging, and post-conviction. It would hardly be surprising to find\nthat a statute that Congress intended to be “broad and encompassing” 118\ncovered events occurring after the filing of charges.\nIndeed, OLC appears to recognize that at least three of the rights listed\nin the CVRA could easily apply before charges are filed: (1) the “right to be\nreasonably protected from the accused”; (2) the “reasonable right to confer\nwith the attorney for the Government in the case”; and (3) the “right to be\ntreated with fairness and with respect for the victim’s dignity and\nprivacy.” 119 None of these rights explicitly refer to court “proceedings” or\nother events (such as parole hearings) that necessarily occur after the filing\nof formal charges. 120\n115 OLC CVRA Rights Memo, supra note 2, at 5–6. Notably, the Department does not\nembrace the language from Huff found within the Skinner and Paletz decisions because\npresumably such an approach would be contrary to many of the rights found in the CVRA.\n116 See infra Part I.C.\n117 OLC CVRA Rights Memo, supra note 2, at 6 (emphasis added) (quoting 18 U.S.C.\n§ 3771(a)(2)).\n118 150 CONG.

See 18 U.S.C.\n§ 3771(c)(1) (requiring prosecutors to “make their best efforts to see that crime victims are\nnotified of, and accorded, the rights described in [the CVRA]”); United States v.

Supp. 2d 411, 428 (E.D.N.Y. 2008) (discussing potential application of the right to\n2014] CRIME VICTIMS’ RIGHTS 81\nFor purposes of this Article, it is appropriate to focus on the last two of\nthese three rights: the right to confer and the right to fair treatment. The\nfirst of these three rights—the right to be reasonably protected—is already\nclearly extended by another statute to crime victims before the filing of\ncharges. While OLC does not acknowledge this fact, the VRRA extends\nthe first right to crime victims, directing that a “responsible official shall\narrange for a victim to receive reasonable protection from a suspected\noffender and persons acting in concert with or at the behest of the suspected\noffender.” 121 Because a “suspected” offender obviously exists before the\nfiling of criminal charges, the VRRA envisions the right to protection being\nprovided as soon as is practical after a victim suffers from the commission\nof a crime. Additionally, the sections of the Attorney General Guidelines\nfor Victim and Witness Assistance addressing the VRRA direct that Justice\nDepartment components must provide reasonable protection even before the\nfiling of criminal charges. 122 So, under the VRRA, the Justice Department\nshould already be providing reasonable protection for a victim before an\noffender is indicted, regardless of how the CVRA is interpreted. 123\nThe VRRA, however, does not contain a right to confer and a right to\nfair treatment and respect for the victim’s dignity. Therefore, if victims are\ngoing to receive these statutory rights before trial, these rights must be\nfound in the CVRA. With regard to the CVRA provision that victims have\nthe “reasonable right to confer with the attorney for the Government in the\ncase,” 124 OLC contends that “[t]he phrase ‘in the case’ implies the pendency\nof a judicial proceeding.” 125 To bolster its conclusion, OLC then cites\nBlack’s Law Dictionary, which includes among its several definitions of the\nword “case” the definition “a civil or criminal proceeding.” 126 But OLC\ndoes not acknowledge that Black’s Law Dictionary also defines and\nexemplifies a “case” more broadly as a “criminal investigation <the\nnotification of rights before charges are filed). For purposes of this Article, it is not\nnecessary to explore this right in detail. If other CVRA rights apply before charges are filed,\na fortiori this right does as well. If a victim has a right, presumably the victim should be\nnotified of the existence of that right.\n121 42 U.S.C. § 10607(c)(2) (2006) (emphasis added).\n122 See ATTORNEY GENERAL GUIDELINES, supra note 52, at 7–8, 26–28.\n123 Exactly what “reasonable protection” means, however, remains uncertain. See\ngenerally Mary Margaret Giannini, Redeeming an Empty Promise: Procedural Justice, the\nCrime Victims’ Rights Act, and the Victim’s Right to Be Reasonably Protected from the\nAccused, 78 TENN. L.

[Vol. 104\nManson case>.” 127 Thus, Black’s Law Dictionary does not help resolve the\ndispute as to which of the two meanings should be used, as there are clearly\ndiffering meanings. While OLC’s reading may be a permissible one, so is a\npro-victim reading.\nOLC also turns to the CVRA’s legislative history to bolster its\nconclusion. But, here again, its analysis is misleading. OLC relies on a\npassage from Senate floor colloquy between Senators Jon Kyl and Dianne\nFeinstein regarding the CVRA’s scope. In OLC’s recounting of the\nlegislative history, the floor statements “emphasize that the right to confer\nrelates to the conduct of criminal proceedings after the filing of charges.” 128\nFor instance, OLC quotes Senator Kyl stating that “[u]nder this provision,\nvictims are able to confer with the Government’s attorney about\nproceedings after charging.” 129\nThis is a truncated and deceptive description of the legislative history,\nso much so that Senator Kyl sent an angry letter to Attorney General Eric\nHolder complaining about the distortion. On June 6, 2011, the Senator\nwrote to “express [his] surprise that [OLC is] so clearly quoting [his]\nremarks out of context.” 130 Senator Kyl then went on to observe that the\ncolloquy began by noting that the right to confer “is intended to be\nexpansive.” 131 The Senator further discussed various “examples” of when\nthe right to confer applied, including “any critical stage or disposition of the\ncase. The right, however, is not limited to these examples.” 132 It was\nagainst that backdrop that Senator Kyl gave the example of conferring\nabout proceedings “after charging.”\nIn his letter to Attorney General Holder, Senator Kyl also noted that he\nhad:\nmade clear that crime victims had rights under the CVRA even before an indictment is\nfiled. For example, . . . I made clear that crime victims had a right to consult about\nboth ‘the case’ and ‘case proceedings’—i.e., both about how the case was being\nhandled before being filed in court and then later how the case was being handled in\ncourt ‘proceedings.’ 133\nSenator Kyl further commented that he had discussed the CVRA’s potential\napplication in grand jury proceedings, an application that required the Act\n127 BLACK’S LAW DICTIONARY, supra note 59, at 244.\n128 OLC CVRA Rights Memo, supra note 2, at 9.\n129 Id.

Shortly after shepherding the\nCVRA through the Congress, Senator Kyl cowrote a law review article\nabout the Act. 136 In that article, he directly indicated that the CVRA applies\nbefore charges are filed. Senator Kyl and his coauthors wrote:\nWhile most of the rights guaranteed by the CVRA apply in the context of legal\nproceedings following arrest and charging, other important rights are triggered by the\nharm inflicted by the crime itself. For example, the right to be treated with fairness,\nthe right to be reasonably protected from the accused (who may qualify as the accused\nbefore his arrest), and the right to be treated with respect for the victim’s dignity and\nprivacy each may arise without regard to the existence of legal proceedings. 137\nRemarkably, OLC cited Senator Kyl’s law review article (in a footnote), but\nthen concluded without explanation that the CVRA cosponsor’s views were\nfor some reason different than Congress’s. 138\nOLC also appears to acknowledge that its interpretation of the CVRA\ncould well contradict what it describes as prosecutorial “good practice.” 139\nOLC noted that some Justice Department components (for example, the\nEnvironmental and Natural Resources Division) had advocated that the\nright to confer should apply during pre-charging plea discussions. 140 OLC\nthen acknowledged that limiting the right to confer until after formal\ncharging could “reduce the impact of a victim’s participation in subsequent\ncourt proceedings.” 141 OLC attempted to dodge this problem by explaining:\n“The question before us, though, is not whether it would be advisable as a\nmatter of good practice . . . for Government attorneys to confer with victims\npre-charge when appropriate . . . .” 142 OLC then explained that even under\nits narrow interpretation of the statute, “the CVRA would still ensure that\n134 Id.\n135 Attorney General Holder never sent a response to Senator Kyl’s letter.

[Vol. 104\nthe victim has an opportunity to be heard by the court, and by the\nGovernment, before the court accepts the plea.” 143\nBut OLC failed to recognize that its interpretation of the CVRA\nrendered the right to be heard a nullity in many important cases—including,\nnotably, the Epstein case. 144 Where prosecutors and defense attorneys work\nout a nonprosecution agreement that agreement will never be presented to a\ncourt for review. Thus, in cases where the need for victim participation\nmay be the greatest—that is, in cases where the Government is considering\nnever filing any charges—OLC’s interpretation would bar victims from\nhaving any rights at all.\nEven in situations where a prosecutor works out a plea agreement,\nOLC’s interpretation is problematic. As OLC recognizes, prosecutors and\ndefense counsel commonly work out pre-indictment plea agreements\n(particularly in white-collar cases), under which a defendant will plead\nguilty to certain charges. 145 Then, the parties jointly present to the district\ncourt a criminal “information” (that is, a recitation of the charges drafted by\nthe prosecutor but never presented to the grand jury 146 ) and a plea\nagreement, asking the court to file the criminal information and\nsimultaneously accept the guilty plea. As the OLC memorandum\nacknowledges, a crime victim would have the right to object to the plea\nagreement, because the CVRA gives crime victims the “right to be\nreasonably heard” at any public proceedings involving a plea. 147 But under\nOLC’s interpretation of the CVRA, a crime victim has no right to notice of\ncourt hearings until the charges are filed. Thus, if the information and plea\nare filed simultaneously, as is often the case, two scenarios are possible. A\nvictim could have no prior right to notice of the proceeding at which the\nplea was being accepted, or alternatively (if the act of filing the information\nin the course of accepting a plea triggers a notification right), the district\ncourt would be required to stop in the middle of proceedings and ensure that\nnotification was belatedly provided. Of course, these difficulties are all\navoided if the right to confer is properly construed as attaching before\ncharges are filed, such as during plea negotiations between prosecutors and\ndefense attorneys.\n143 Id.\n144 The OLC opinion was publicly released on May 20, 2011. Perhaps not\ncoincidentally, this release date was shortly before the Government filed its response in the\nEpstein case.\n145 See OLC CVRA Rights Memo, supra note 2, at 9 (acknowledging the potential effect\nof the CVRA on plea negotiations).\n146 See FED.

After the OLC memorandum\nwas made public, the Department amended the Attorney General\nGuidelines for Victim and Witness Assistance to require prosecutors to\nmake reasonable efforts toward a goal of providing victims with a\nmeaningful opportunity to offer their views before plea agreements are\nformally reached. 148 “In circumstances where plea negotiations occur\nbefore a case has been brought, Department policy is that this should\ninclude reasonable consultation prior to the filing of a charging instrument\nwith the court.” 149 Thus, Department policy already extends pre-charging\nrights to victims. The CVRA should be understood as having the same\nscope.\nOLC also notes that the CVRA right “to be treated with fairness and\nwith respect for the victim’s dignity and privacy” is a right that could apply\nbefore charges are filed. 150 Indeed, OLC is forced to concede (as district\ncourts have recognized) that the “right to be treated with fairness and with\nrespect for the victim’s dignity and privacy may apply with great force\nduring an investigation, before any charging instrument has been filed.” 151\nOLC nonetheless maintains that the right to fairness only applies after\ncharges have been filed. OLC relies on the canon of statutory construction\nnoscitur a sociis, meaning that words are known by their companions, 152 for\nits interpretation of the CVRA. OLC argues that because the other seven\nenumerated rights are limited to post-charging situations, the eighth right\nshould be as well. Of course, this argument assumes that OLC’s\nconstruction of the other seven rights is correct—a point very much in\ndispute. 153 If, for example, the right to confer applies before charges are\nfiled, then presumably noscitur a sociis would cut the other way—the right\nto fairness should likewise be construed as applying before charges are\nfiled.\nMoreover, OLC omits from its discussion of the fairness provision any\nassessment of the CVRA’s purposes. In construing a statute, a court must\nconsider the “purpose and context” of the statute. 154 In describing the\nfairness provision, Senator Kyl emphasized that it conferred a “broad”\n148 ATTORNEY GENERAL GUIDELINES, supra note 52, at 41–42.\n149 Id. at 41.\n150 OLC CVRA Rights Memo, supra note 2, at 10 (quoting 18 U.S.C. § 3771(a)(8)).\n151 Id.

This provision is intended to direct Government\nagencies and employees, whether they are in the executive or judiciary\nbranch, to treat victims of crime with the respect they deserve.” 156 OLC’s\nfailure to consider the purposes underlying the CVRA is a glaring\noversight.\nOLC never attempts to explain why the CVRA’s drafters would want\nvictims to have a right to fair treatment once criminal charges were filed but\npossess no such right before the filing of criminal charges. Clearly, many\nvictims can and do suffer secondary victimization during criminal\ninvestigations, such as when sexual assault victims are treated\ninappropriately by law enforcement agents. 157 It would contradict the\npurpose of preventing victim mistreatment in the criminal justice system to\nartificially limit the right to fairness to the point at which charges are filed.\nThe right to fairness logically applies at all stages of the criminal justice\nprocess.\nC. OLC’S INEFFECTIVE RESPONSE TO THE CVRA’S COVERAGE AND\nVENUE PROVISIONS\nAt the end of its memorandum, OLC finally discusses what it\nidentifies as the two strongest arguments for construing the CVRA as\napplying before charging: the coverage provision and the venue provision.\nOLC acknowledges, as it must, that the CVRA’s coverage extends to any\nfederal employee engaged in “the detection, investigation or prosecution of\ncrime.” 158 Such employees “shall make their best efforts to see that crime\nvictims are notified of, and accorded, the rights” afforded by the statute. 159\nNotably, this duty applies to individuals not just in the Justice Department\n(where all federal prosecutors are located) but other agencies as well, such\n155 150 CONG.

In directing that federal\nemployees engaged in the “detection” and “investigation” of crime must\nrespect victims’ rights, Congress wanted broad rights extending beyond just\nthe prosecution of a case. As the district court concluded in the Epstein\ncase, this provision “surely contemplates pre-charge application of the\nCVRA.” 161\nOLC gamely maintains, however, that Congress was simply trying to\nprovide that federal law enforcement agents should provide rights to\nvictims when a criminal case moves to its prosecution phase. OLC noted\nthe uncontroversial point that law enforcement agents “often develop a\nrelationship of trust with crime victims during the investigation that\ncontinues as they assist crime victims in negotiating active criminal\nproceedings.” 162 OLC then asserted:\nGiven this continuing active role that agents typically play during criminal\nprosecutions, we find the fact that the CVRA assigns responsibility to them, together\nwith the attorney for the Government, to . . . accord them their rights under the CVRA\nto be entirely consistent with our conclusion that those rights arise only once the\nGovernment has initiated criminal proceedings. 163\nBut OLC’s contorted position never explains why Congress found it\nnecessary to break out three separate phases of the criminal justice process:\nthe “detection,” “investigation,” and “prosecution” of crime. If the\ncongressional intent was simply to cover, for example, FBI agents or EPA\nagents during the post-charging phase of a case, it could have simply\nomitted those words from the CVRA. An FBI agent, for example, would be\nengaged in the “prosecution” of the case when assisting the victim after the\nformal filing of charges. On OLC’s reading of the statute, the words\n“detection” and “investigation” become meaningless, contrary to the wellknown\ncanon of construction verba cum effectu sunt accipienda, which\nmeans that, if possible, every word and every provision is to be given\neffect. 164\nOLC also suggests that the “most significant” argument supporting\npre-charging application of rights is the venue provision, which allows\n160 See Kyl et al., supra note 136, at 615 (“Notice should be given to the fact that it applies\nnot just to the Department of Justice, but to all ‘departments and agencies of the United States\nengaged in the detection, investigation, or prosecution of crime.’” (citation omitted)).\n161 Does v.

OLC notes that the filing of a\ncomplaint triggers an initial appearance, where crime victims can have\nimportant interests at stake, such as the right to be heard about a\ndefendant’s release on bail. OLC believes it is only to such post-complaint,\nyet pre-indictment, proceedings (i.e., the initial appearance) that the venue\nprovision’s “no-prosecution-underway” language covers.\nAs a preliminary matter, OLC’s interpretation of the word\n“prosecution” in the Department’s narrow construction of the venue\nprovision is a twisted one, at odds with the way that term is conventionally\nused. The filing of a complaint is typically viewed as the start of a criminal\nprosecution. For example, the leading criminal procedure hornbook states\nthat “[w]ith the filing of the complaint, the arrestee officially becomes a\n‘defendant’ in a criminal prosecution.” 168\nMoreover, having specifically rejected the filing of the criminal\ncomplaint as the starting point for a “prosecution” within the CVRA’s\nvenue provision, OLC refuses to consider the implications of its alterative\nstarting point: the formal filing of an indictment. OLC states that “a\nprosecution of a felony must commence with the return of an indictment by\na grand jury,” citing the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. 169 Yet OLC\ndoes not pause to recognize that, while felonies proceed by way of\nindictment, misdemeanors can proceed not only by indictment but also by\ncomplaint. 170 The CVRA draws no distinction between misdemeanor and\n165 OLC CVRA Rights Memo, supra note 2, at 14 (quoting 18 U.S.C. § 3771(d)(3) (2012)).\n166 Id.\n167 Id.

It is not immediately clear why one would\nlook to the right to counsel to determine the breadth of the term\n“prosecution” in the Sixth Amendment. The right to counsel is not the only\nright found in that Amendment. The Amendment also extends, for\nexample, a right to a speedy trial in all criminal “prosecutions.” 172 The case\nlaw on the speedy trial right makes clear that the right “may attach before\nan indictment and as early as the time of arrest and holding to answer a\ncriminal charge.” 173\nIn any event, the right to counsel cases are quite clear in providing that\na Sixth Amendment “prosecution” can (and often does) begin well before\nan indictment. 174 The Supreme Court has directly held that the Sixth\nAmendment’s right to counsel attaches “at or after the time that judicial\nproceedings have been initiated against [a person]—‘whether by way of\nformal charge, preliminary hearing, indictment, information, or\narraignment.’” 175 Thus, under this controlling precedent, some earlier point\nin time before indictment is the triggering point of a Sixth Amendment\n“prosecution.”\nThe cases that OLC cites are not to the contrary. It is true that some\nfederal appeals courts have stated that the mere filing of a criminal\ncomplaint does not trigger a Sixth Amendment right to counsel. 176 But\nthere is a split of authority on this question, as OLC acknowledges in a\nfootnote. 177 More importantly for purposes of this Article, the cases holding\n171 See 18 U.S.C. § 3771(e) (2012).\n172 U.S. CONST. amend.

[Vol. 104\nthat the mere filing of a complaint does not start a Sixth Amendment\nprosecution also make clear that a later court hearing would start such a\nprosecution. For instance, in the Fourth Circuit case cited by OLC, United\nStates v. Alvarado, the court reasons that “the main reason a law\nenforcement officer files [] a complaint is to establish probable cause for an\narrest warrant. The criminal process is still in the investigative stage, and\nthe adverse positions of government and defendant have yet to solidify.” 178\nRelying on that reasoning, the Fourth Circuit refused to find that the right to\ncounsel had attached merely because a police officer had filed a complaint\nto get an arrest warrant. But the Fourth Circuit distinguished that situation\nfrom “the initiation of adversary judicial proceedings against the\ndefendant.” 179 An initial appearance would be such an adversary\nproceeding—i.e., it would be a “prosecution” under the Sixth Amendment.\nIn light of this, OLC’s position that the CVRA’s venue provision’s “noprosecution-underway”\nreference covers proceedings, such as an initial\nappearance, does not work.\nThe only sensible way to construe the CVRA’s venue provision is to\nread it as conveniently dividing criminal cases into two phases: a\nprosecution phase and an earlier investigative phase when “no prosecution\nis under way.” 180 Senator Kyl, for instance, has noted that if there are any\ndoubts about how to construe the CVRA, this venue provision “sweeps\nthem away.” 181 Once again, the language that Congress used leads\ninexorably to the conclusion that the CVRA extends rights to victims before\nthe filing of criminal charges.\nIV. WHEN PRE-CHARGING RIGHTS ATTACH UNDER THE CVRA\nThe zeal with which OLC argues against applying CVRA rights before\ncharging raises the question of why it protests so much. Although OLC\nnever articulated this concern, perhaps OLC worried that pre-charging\nrights would be difficult to administer. Such concerns should evaporate\nwith a workable construction of when pre-charging rights attach. In this\nPart, we propose such a construction, suggesting that CVRA rights should\nattach when substantial evidence exists that a specific person has been\ndirectly and proximately harmed as the result of a federal crime. This\napproach appears to already be the method that the Department is taking, as\nthis document is used for multiple purposes.”); see also Felder v.

A TEST FOR DETERMINING WHEN RIGHTS ATTACH\nAs explained in the earlier Parts of this Article, the CVRA clearly\nenvisions that crime victims would have rights in the criminal justice\nprocess before the return of indictments or the filing of criminal complaints.\nThe question then as to how much earlier in the process crime victims have\nrights naturally arises. Does the CVRA apply one second after a federal\ncrime has been committed? Or does it apply at some later point during an\ninvestigation?\nThis issue was nicely framed by the U.S. District Court for the Eastern\nDistrict of New York in a securities fraud case. In the first indictment\nunderlying the case, the charged crime did not include various victims. A\nlater superseding indictment broadened the charges to include those missing\nindividuals. When they brought a suit under the CVRA, the court noted\nthat “[q]uite understandably, movants perceive their victimization as having\nbegun long before the government got around to filing the superseding\nindictment.” 184 The court, however, explained that there must be “logical\nlimits” to crime victims’ rights before the filing of charges. 185 The court\nnoted:\nFor example, the realm of cases in which the CVRA might apply despite no\nprosecution being ‘underway,’ cannot be read to include the victims of uncharged\ncrimes that the government has not even contemplated. It is impossible to expect the\ngovernment, much less a court, to notify crime victims of their rights if the\ngovernment has not verified to at least an elementary degree that a crime has actually\ntaken place, given that a corresponding investigation is at a nascent or theoretical\nstage. 186\nThe logical limits that the CVRA envisions could come from how the\nJustice Department interacts with criminals during the investigation of a\ncrime. Crime victims’ rights advocates are fond of saying that victims\n“only want to be treated like criminals”—that is, they simply want to have\nthe same kinds of rights as criminals receive, such as the right to be notified\n182 See, e.g., ATTORNEY GENERAL GUIDELINES, supra note 52, at 41–42 (discussing the\nright to confer regarding plea bargains).\n183 See infra Part III.D.\n184 United States v. Rubin, 558 F. Supp. 2d 411, 419 (E.D.N.Y. 2008).\n185 Id.\n186 Id.\n92 CASSELL ET AL. [Vol. 104\nof court hearings and to attend those hearings. 187 So it is instructive to\nnotice that the Justice Department policy is to extend certain rights to\nsuspected criminals during certain points in the investigative process. That\npolicy might provide guidance on when crime victims’ rights would attach.\nOf particular interest here is the Department’s policy for grand jury\nsubpoenas issued to a “target” of a criminal investigation. When such a\ntarget is subpoenaed to testify before a grand jury, the Department of\nJustice will advise that target of his rights, such as the right to refuse to\nanswer any question that might be incriminating. 188 The Department of\nJustice defines a “target” of a criminal investigation as “a person as to\nwhom the prosecutor or the grand jury has substantial evidence linking him\nor her to the commission of a crime and who, in the judgment of the\nprosecutor, is a putative defendant.” 189\nIf the Department’s investigation has coalesced sufficiently so that it\ncan provide notice of rights to putative defendants, it should likewise be in\na position to provide notice of rights to that defendant’s victims.\nCombining the Department’s definition of “target” with the CVRA’s\ncoverage and definition-of-victim provisions produces a formulation\nwhereby CVRA rights attach in (at least) the following circumstances:\nCVRA rights attach when an officer or employee of the Department of\nJustice or any other department or agency of the United States engaged in\nthe detection, investigation, or prosecution of crime has substantial\nevidence that an identifiable person has been directly and proximately\nharmed as a result of the commission of a federal offense or an offense in\nthe District of Columbia, and in the judgment of the officer or employee,\nthat person is a putative victim of that offense.\nThis formulation borrows from the CVRA’s coverage provision 190 to\ndefine the relevant universe of substantial evidence as that in the possession\nof the Justice Department or other federal agencies. For instance, if state\nlaw enforcement officers are investigating a bank robbery, the fact that the\nrobbery might also be prosecuted federally 191 does not make the teller at the\nbank a federal “victim” of the crime until evidence regarding the crime\ncomes into the possession of a federal agency. The formulation also tracks\nthe CVRA’s definition of “victim” in limiting the universe of potential\n187 See, e.g., Cassell, supra note 15, at 1376–85 (describing the rationale underpinning\nstate victims’ rights statutes).\n188 CRIMINAL RESOURCE MANUAL, supra note 87, § 9-11.151.\n189 Id.\n190 18 U.S.C. § 3771(e) (2012).\n191 Id. § 2113.\n2014] CRIME VICTIMS’ RIGHTS 93\nvictims to those who have been “directly and proximately harmed.” 192\nFinally, the formulation requires some federal officer or employee to\nevaluate the evidence and reach the conclusion that a federal offense has\nbeen committed that harmed the person in question. This determination\nresponds to the observation by the District Court for the Eastern District of\nNew York that the CVRA “cannot be read to include the victims of\nuncharged crimes that the government has not even contemplated.” 193 At\nthe same time, such a formulation obviously does not require the filing of\nformal criminal charges, or even the preparation of formal criminal charges.\nInstead, all that is required is for the Department to recognize that a person\nis a putative victim of a federal offense, just as all that is required for the\nmailing of a target letter to a subpoenaed suspected criminal, is recognition\nthat he is a putative defendant in a federal case.\nB. APPLYING THE TEST TO THE EPSTEIN CASE\nTo illustrate how the test would operate, it is useful to examine the\nfacts of the Epstein case. Applying the proposed test to that case produces\nstraightforward answers, which suggests that the test would be workable in\npractice.\nFrom 2001 to 2007, Jeffrey Epstein sexually abused more than thirty\nminor girls in his mansion, including Jane Doe Number One and Jane Doe\nNumber Two. 194 Initially, of course, his acts of abuse were secret, unknown\nto law enforcement. During that period of time, the victims would not have\nhad rights under the CVRA.\nIn 2006, Epstein’s acts of abuse came to the attention of the Palm\nBeach Police Department, which began investigating the case. 195 At this\npoint, once again, the victims would not have had rights under the proposed\nCVRA test. The CVRA extends rights in the federal criminal justice\nprocess. A state investigation does not trigger the CVRA (although it may\ntrigger certain state law protections, as discussed below). 196\nAt some point in 2006, the Palm Beach Police Department asked the\nFBI to investigate Epstein on federal sex offenses, such as using a means of\n192 See id. § 3771(e).\n193 United States v. Rubin, 558 F. Supp. 2d 411, 419 (E.D.N.Y. 2008).\n194 As above, see supra notes 34–41 and accompanying text, this part of the Article\ndraws on the factual allegations made by the victims in this case—allegations that Epstein\nhas not intervened to dispute. See Jane Doe Motion, supra note 40, at 3–23.\n195 See Probable Cause Affidavit, Palm Beach Police Department: Police Case No. 05-\n368(1) (May 1, 2006), available at http://goo.gl/fAPFw5; see also Statement of Undisputed\nFacts, Epstein v.

[Vol. 104\ninterstate communication in connection with sex offenses and traveling in\ninterstate commerce for the purpose of engaging in illicit sexual conduct\nwith minors. 197 The local police provided the FBI with information, which\nthe FBI then investigated. Following an investigation, the FBI determined\nthat the allegations of abuse against Epstein were credible, and it presented\nthe case to the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of Florida.\nIn 2007, the Office contacted counsel for Jeffrey Epstein and began\nnegotiating a resolution of the case against him. 198\nUnder our proposed test, the victims would not have had CVRA rights\nthe first moment that the FBI became aware of Epstein’s possible\ncommission of sex offenses. But after the FBI developed substantial\nevidence of those sex offenses, identified victims of those offenses, and\npresented the case to the appropriate U.S. Attorney’s Office for prosecution,\nCVRA rights would have attached. Accordingly, the FBI would have been\nrequired to notify the identified victims of their rights under the CVRA (as\nwell as under the VRRA). From that point forward in the case, the victims\nwould have had CVRA rights, such as the right to fair treatment and the\nright to confer with prosecutors. In this case, the victims would have had\nthe right to confer with prosecutors about the nonprosecution agreement\nthat they ultimately reached with Epstein. 199\nC. CURRENT DEPARTMENT POLICY ON PRE-CHARGING RIGHTS\nOne objection that might be made to the formulation offered above is\nthat it might unduly burden federal law enforcement officers and\nprosecutors, who would need to make judgment calls about when an\ninvestigation has coalesced to the point where “victims” are in existence,\n“substantial evidence” has been collected, and notice of rights has to be\nprovided. Any such objection would be ill-founded, though, as it does not\nappear that implementing such an approach would be difficult. 200\nPresumably the Justice Department has already been providing such rights\nin at least Texas, Louisiana, and Mississippi to comply with the Fifth\n197 See 18 U.S.C. §§ 2422(b), 2423(b), (e) (2012).\n198 A more substantial summary of the case is available in case filings. See Jane Doe\nMotion, supra note 40.\n199 See supra Part II.\n200 This Article does not discuss mass victim cases in which notice needs to be provided\nto hundreds of victims. But in such situations, the CVRA already provides for “reasonable”\nalternative procedures. 18 U.S.C. § 3771(d)(2) (2012). The Department of Justice, for\nexample, has used websites to provide notice in terrorism cases to large numbers of victims.\nSee, e.g., United States v. Ingrassia, No. CR-04-0455ADSJO, 2005 WL 2875220, at *4\n(E.D.N.Y. Sept. 7, 2005); Criminal Division’s Victim Notification Program, U.S. DEP’T OF\nJUSTICE, http://goo.gl/6H6IEk (last visited Dec. 4, 2013).\n2014] CRIME VICTIMS’ RIGHTS 95\nCircuit’s 2008 ruling in In Re Dean, which held that the CVRA extends\nrights to victims before defendants are charged. 201 We have not seen any\nreports that providing the rights has been difficult.\nPerhaps the reason for the lack of any reported difficulty is that the\nDepartment’s current policy on crime victims’ rights already requires\nnotices to victims during investigations. The Justice Department has\npromulgated the Attorney General Guidelines for Victim and Witness\nAssistance, the latest edition of which is from May 2012. The Guidelines\ndiscuss crime victims’ rights under both the CVRA and the earlier VRRA.\nBecause of the OLC memorandum discussed above, the Guidelines limit\nCVRA rights until after the time “when criminal proceedings are initiated\nby complaint, information, or indictment.” 202 The Department, however,\nprovides hortatory guidance that Justice Department employees shall make\n“best efforts” to notify crime victims about their CVRA rights “as early in\nthe criminal justice process as is feasible and appropriate.” 203\nOf greater interest, however, is the Department’s mandatory policy\nregarding notification regarding crime victim services under the VRRA.\nThe Guidelines explain how “Department responsibilities to crime victims\nbegin as soon as possible after the detection of a crime at which they may\nbe undertaken without interfering in the investigation.” 204 The Guidelines\nthen direct the appropriate “responsible official” to provide crime victims\nwith “information about services available to them.” 205 This information\nmust be provided at “the earliest opportunity after detection of a crime at\nwhich it may be done without interfering with an investigation.” 206\nThe Department appears to have little difficulty implementing this\nrequirement. Evidence of this fact comes from the Justice Department\nitself, which responded to the letter from Senator Kyl discussed earlier\nquestioning why the Department was not applying the CVRA before\ncharges were filed. 207 In its response, the Department noted that OLC had\nissued an opinion that the CVRA did not extend rights before the formal\nfiling of charges. 208 “Even so,” the Department explained, “the new AG\nGuidelines go further and provide that Department prosecutors should make\n201 527 F.3d 391 (5th Cir. 2008).\n202 ATTORNEY GENERAL GUIDELINES, supra note 52, at 8.\n203 Id. at 35.\n204 Id. at 26 (citing 42 U.S.C. § 10607(b) (2006)).\n205 Id. at 29 (citing 42 U.S.C. § 10607(b)(2)).

[Vol. 104\nreasonable efforts to notify identified victims of, and consider victims’\nviews about, prospective plea negotiations, even prior to the filing of a\ncharging instrument with the court.” 209\nThe Department also noted that it provided extensive pre-charging\nnotifications to victims under the VRRA:\nPursuant to the Victims’ Rights and Restitution Act of 1990 (VRRA), the Department\nidentifies victims and provides to them service referrals, reasonable protection, notice\nconcerning the status of the investigation, and information about the criminal justice\nprocess prior to the filing of any charges. The Department’s investigative agencies\nprovide such services to thousands of victims every year, whether or not the\ninvestigation results in a federal prosecution. 210\nQuantifying the scope of this undertaking with regard to one federal\ninvestigative agency, the Department explained:\n[T]he [FBI] alone reports that it provided more than 190,000 services to victims\nduring the past fiscal year [FY 2011], including case status updates, assistance with\ncompensation applications and referrals, and counseling referrals. From sexual\nassaults in Indian Country to child pornography and human trafficking to mass\nviolence and overseas terrorism, FBI victim specialists provide much-needed\nimmediate and ongoing support and information to victims. The FBI addresses victim\nsafety issues when needed, providing on-scene response and crisis intervention\nservices in thousands of investigations. With regard to sexual assault victims, FBI\npersonnel arrange for and often accompany victims to forensic sexual assault medical\nexaminations and provide assistance with HIV/STD testing. 211\nIn view of the Department’s existing notifications and provision of\nservices before charges are filed under the VRRA, it is hard to conceive\nhow any viable claim could be made that it would be difficult to provide\nsimilar rights under the CVRA. The four rights that would be potentially in\nplay before charging would be the right to reasonable protection, the right\nto fair treatment, and the right to confer with prosecutors, along with the\npredicate right to notice of these rights. 212 The VRRA already requires the\nDepartment to provide reasonable protection, so this would not be an\nexpanded obligation. 213 Similarly, the Guidelines already require\nprosecutors to confer with victims about plea agreements (the most\ncommon situation where victims want to confer), so it is hard to imagine\nhow extending this right would create any undue burden. 214 Additionally,\nthe right to “fair treatment” could only be a problem if the Department\n209 Id.\n210 Id. at 2–3.\n211 Id. at 3.\n212 18 U.S.C. § 3771(a)(1), (5), (8), (c)(1) (2012).\n213 See 42 U.S.C. § 10607(c)(2) (2006).\n214 See ATTORNEY GENERAL GUIDELINES, supra note 52, at 41–42.\n2014] CRIME VICTIMS’ RIGHTS 97\nwanted to treat victims unfairly. Given its repeated and professed\ncommitment to crime victims, here too this obligation should not be\nburdensome. And finally, with regard to providing notice of CVRA rights\nto victims, the fact that the Department currently provides notice of VRRA\nrights indicates that it should not be difficult to provide notice of CVRA\nrights as well.\nIndeed, it is possible that the Department’s notification letters under\nthe VRRA already include this information. Interestingly, in the Epstein\ncase, the FBI notified Jane Doe Number One and Jane Doe Number Two\nthat they had rights in the criminal justice process. As early as June 7,\n2007—more than three months before it concluded a nonprosecution\nagreement with Epstein—the U.S. Attorney’s Office sent a notice to Jane\nDoe Number One stating “your case is under investigation.” 215 The notice\nalso informed Jane Doe Number One that “as a victim and/or witness of a\nfederal offense, you have a number of rights.” 216 Among the rights that the\nU.S. Attorney’s Office told Jane Doe that she possessed was “[t]he\nreasonable right to confer with the attorney for the United States in the\ncase.” 217 Of course, she would not have had those rights if she was not\ncovered by the CVRA. The FBI therefore apparently assumed that the\nCVRA already applied in the Epstein case. It was only later, when the\nmatter went into litigation, that the Department of Justice reversed course.\nThis change in course underscores the problems arising out of the OLC\nmemorandum and the Department’s current interpretation of the CVRA.\nD. STATE LAW EXTENSION OF PRE-CHARGING RIGHTS\nThe focus of this Article so far has been crime victims’ rights in the\nfederal system. But in concluding, it is instructive to note how a number of\nstates offer parallel rights for crime victims, including the right to confer\nwith prosecutors. In fact, several states have extended such rights prior to\nformally filing of charges against defendants—without reported difficulty,\nso far as we are aware. This confirms our inference that extending CVRA\nrights to crime victims before the formal filing of criminal charges is both\nfeasible and desirable.\nA general overview of state laws illustrates the broad protections\nafforded to victims in state criminal justice systems. Nearly two-thirds of\nstates have adopted constitutional provisions to protect victims throughout\n215 Letter from A.

[Vol. 104\nthe criminal justice process. 218 Moreover, every state has adopted a statute\nthat either enforces its constitutional amendment or creates independent\nstatutory rights for crime victims. 219 As a result, state legislatures and state\nemployees have attempted to give victims a voice in the criminal justice\nprocess across the country.\nNotably, while the strength of these rights varies from state to state, 220\nnearly forty states require the prosecuting attorney to notify or confer with\nthe victim regarding plea negotiations. 221 Several jurisdictions involve the\nvictim in the charging decision. 222 In some states, law enforcement and\nprosecutors must involve the victim at any “critical” 223 or “crucial” 224 stage\nof the criminal proceeding; and in a minority of jurisdictions, the judge\nmust ascertain whether the prosecutor has afforded the victim statutory\nprotections prior to accepting a plea agreement. 225\nThe general contours of state provisions suggest that several state\ngovernments have recognized the value in informing victims of their rights\nand involving them in the criminal process prior to the formal filing of\ncharges. 226 Indeed, a brief look at the statutory protections illustrates the\nextent to which states have attempted to afford protections to victims long\nbefore the formal filing of charges.\n218 See Victims’ Rights Laws by State, NAT’L CRIME VICTIM L.

Unfortunately, as some commentators\nhave noted, the notice and conferral provisions in some states are ambiguous, and the\nabsence of case law precludes a definitive understanding of the reach of the right in some\njurisdictions.

In\nsome jurisdictions, the ambiguous use of an illustrative list could be read as suggesting that a\nparticular right, such as conferral, hinges on formal charges. See, e.g., KY. REV. STAT. ANN.\n§ 421.500(6) (LexisNexis Supp. 2012) (requiring consultation on “disposition of the case\nincluding dismissal, release of defendant pending judicial proceedings, any conditions of\nrelease, a negotiated plea, and entry into a pretrial diversion program,” but failing to define\n“disposition” or “case”).\n222 See Tobolowsky, supra note 221, at 59–60.\n223 E.g., LA. REV. STAT. ANN. §§ 46:1842(2), 46:1844(K) (2010).\n224 E.g., FLA. CONST. art. I, § 16(b) (refraining from identifying the term).\n225 See LAFAVE ET AL., supra note 168, § 21.3(f), at 1041.\n226 See Victims’ Rights Laws by State, supra note 218.\n2014] CRIME VICTIMS’ RIGHTS 99\nFor example, Arizona has adopted a constitutional amendment and\nstatutes that expansively protect victims. Under Arizona law, the definition\nof victim hinges on whether a criminal offense has been committed, and the\nterm “criminal offense” is defined as “conduct that gives a peace officer or\nprosecutor probable cause to believe” a crime has occurred. 227 In short, a\nvictim’s status does not hinge on the formal filing of charges but rather on\nthe criminal conduct itself. 228 Arizona law enforcement personnel must\ngive information to victims describing their rights as soon as possible, even\nif formal charges have not yet been filed, and a victim may request that the\nprosecutor discuss the disposition of the case, including “a decision not to\nproceed with a criminal prosecution, dismissal, plea, or sentence\nnegotiations and pretrial diversion programs.” 229 A victim may even pursue\nsome rights if counts are dismissed. 230 Arizona courts have also permitted\nvictims to invoke their rights in the context of civil forfeiture\nproceedings. 231\nHawaii’s victims’ rights statute illustrates how a state has defined the\nterm “case” more expansively than the limited definition advocated by the\nDepartment in order to facilitate victim participation. By statute in Hawaii,\nvictims must, upon request, be informed of “major developments” in any\nfelony case. 232 Along a similar vein, the prosecuting attorney must consult\nor advise the victim about any plea negotiations. 233 Interestingly, however,\nthe Hawaii legislature defined “major developments” as “arrest or release of\nthe suspect by the police, case deferral by the police, referral to the\nprosecutor by the police, rejection of the case by the prosecutor, preliminary\nhearing date, grand jury date, trial and sentencing dates, and the disposition\nof the case.” 234 The usage of the term “case” and the plain language of the\nprovisions demonstrate that victims in the State of Hawaii are entitled to a\nnotification right and a possible consultation right long before formal\ncharges are filed.\n227 ARIZ. REV. STAT. ANN. § 13-4401(6) (2010) (emphasis added); see State ex rel.\nThomas v. Klein, 150 P.3d 778, 780–81 (Ariz. Ct. App. 2007) (noting the original version\ndefined a criminal offense as a violation of a statute).\n228 Under Arizona law, the “rights and duties that are established by this chapter arise on the\narrest or formal charging of the person or persons who are alleged to be responsible for a criminal\noffence against a victim.” ARIZ. REV. STAT. ANN. § 13-4402(A) (2010) (emphasis added).\n229 ARIZ. REV. STAT. ANN. § 13-4419(A) (2010).\n230 See ARIZ. REV. STAT. ANN. § 13-4402.01(A).\n231 It appears, however, that the criminal proceeding may have been parallel to the civil\nforfeiture proceeding. See State v. Lee, 245 P.3d 919, 923–24 (Ariz. Ct. App. 2011).\n232 HAW. REV. STAT. ANN. § 801D-4(a)(1) (LexisNexis 2007).\n233 See id.\n234 Id. § 801D-2.\n100 CASSELL ET AL. [Vol. 104\nOther states also expressly extend rights before the filing of charges.\nColorado guarantees rights at “all critical stages of the criminal justice\nprocess[,]” which includes both the filing of charges and the decision to not\nfile charges. 235 In Missouri, victims have the right:\non charged cases or submitted cases where no charge decision has yet been made, to\nbe informed by the prosecuting attorney of the status of the case and of the availability\n[of different forms of compensation and assistance] and of any final decision by the\nprosecuting attorney not to file charges. 236\nIn New Jersey, officials typically send a letter informing the victim “that the\ncase has been referred to the prosecutors’ office and explains and offers the\nservices available from the country office of victim-witness advocacy.” 237\nSubsequent letters to the victim ensure that the victim has notice of a series\nof decisions long before indictment, 238 and the office actively solicits\ninformation in order to “help the prosecutor’s office decide whether or not\nto prosecute a case.” 239 Along a similar vein, the Massachusetts legislature\nincluded a provision that makes it clear that nothing should prevent a\nprosecutor from providing victim services to persons injured by the\ncommission of a crime, even though a complaint or indictment has not yet\nbeen issued. 240\nIn addition to extending rights before the filing of charges, several\nstates require consultation before the prosecutor reaches a plea agreement\nwith the defendant. For example, Idaho’s statute provides that a victim\nmust be given an opportunity “to communicate with the prosecution in\ncriminal or juvenile offenses, and be advised of any proposed plea\nagreement by the prosecuting attorney prior to entering into a plea\nagreement in criminal or juvenile offenses involving crimes of violence, sex\n235 COLO.

For example, Louisiana constrains the\nconferral right to criminal matters “in which formal charges have been filed\nby the district attorney’s office.” 245 Yet, unlike the federal CVRA, this\nstatute specifically excludes pre-charging situations. And, in any event,\ndespite Louisiana’s limitation on a particular right within the statute, the\nlegislature in this state still often saw fit to provide the victim with\nnotification rights, even in the absence of the formal filing of charges. 246\nVery few state courts have ever considered the precise issue of\nwhether conferral rights may attach prior to the formal filing of charges.\nThis is likely caused by the fact that, unlike the federal statute, many state\nstatutes fail to provide the victim with a procedural mechanism for\nchallenging the conduct of prosecutors or law enforcement agencies. 247\nHowever, in rare cases, state courts have implicitly recognized that a\nmeaningful interpretation of victims’ rights should include some rights prior\nto filing.\nFor example, a Connecticut court concluded that a company injured by\nthe delinquent act of a minor was entitled to information about the case\n241 IDAHO CODE ANN. § 19-5306(1)(f) (2004). As in the case of most of the state\nstatutes, the Idaho statute is not without ambiguity. A different provision within the statute\nmakes the notification right contingent “[u]pon the filing of a criminal complaint or juvenile\npetition . . . .” Id. § 19-5306(2).\n242 IND. CODE ANN. § 35-40-5-3(b) (West 2012); id. § 35-40-1-1 (failing to define “case”).\n243 See, e.g., MD. CONST. art. 47(b) (“In a case originating by indictment or information\nfiled in a circuit court, a victim of crime shall have the right to be informed . . . .”).\n244 In Delaware, for example, the statute contains an additional limitation in the conferral\nprovision that is noticeably absent from the duty imposed on law enforcement to provide\ninformation about the victim’s rights to that victim. Compare DEL. CODE ANN. tit. 11,\n§ 9405 (2007), and DEL. CODE ANN. tit. 11, § 9411 (2007) (imposing additional\nrequirements after the Attorney General commences the prosecution), with DEL.

[Vol. 104\ncontained in a police file in a civil proceeding, even though it appears that\nthere was little indication that criminal charges had been filed. 248 Similarly,\nthe South Carolina Supreme Court, while limiting the ability of the victim\nto challenge the conduct of a prosecutor, concluded that the same rights\nunder the state constitution must attach prior to the formal filing of an\nindictment. 249 Other courts have even permitted a victim to recover\ncompensation or reparations for unindicted or acquitted conduct. 250\nIn other words, while few state judiciaries have addressed the precise\ntiming of state crime victims’ rights, those that have addressed the question\nhave typically found that the rights do extend to pre-charging situations.\nDespite the relative dearth of state court cases, it is worth noting that\nmost state statutes unequivocally provide for notification rights early in the\ncriminal process. 251 For example, the Illinois statute imposes a limited duty\non law enforcement agencies to keep victims informed of the status of an\ninvestigation until the accused is apprehended or the agency discontinues\nthe investigation. 252 Similarly, law enforcement agencies in Iowa must\nkeep the victim apprised of the investigation “until the alleged assailant is\napprehended or the investigation is closed.” 253 Michigan’s statute requires\nlaw enforcement to provide information within a mere twenty-four hours of\ncontact between the agency and the victim. 254\nIn sum, while state law on crime victims’ rights before charging is not\nfully developed, what law exists tends to support the position that crime\nvictims deserve rights before the formal filing of charges. This law fits the\nlong-standing trend in states toward expanding protections for crime\n248 See In re James B., Jr., 714 A.2d 735 (Conn. Super. Ct. 1998).\n249 See Ex parte Littlefield, 540 S.E.2d 81, 85 (S.C. 2000).\n250 See Kimberly J.

STAT. ANN. § 611A.0315(a) (West 2009) (requiring a prosecutor to\n“make every reasonable effort to notify a victim of domestic assault . . . or harassment that\nthe prosecutor has decided to decline prosecution of the case” but providing the right to\nparticipate in proceedings to circumstances in which the offender has been charged).\n252 See 725 ILL.

Michigan’s conferral right is\nparticularly ambiguous, because the notification requirement imposed upon the prosecuting\nattorney contains a time limitation (after arraignment), but the legislature did not include an\nexpress time limitation on the conferral right. See MICH. COMP. LAWS ANN. § 780.756(3)\n(West 2007) (requiring the victim have the opportunity to consult prior to “any negotiation\nthat may result in a dismissal, plea or sentence bargain, or pretrial diversion”); see also MISS.\nCODE ANN. § 99-43-7(1) (2007) (imposing a requirement on law enforcement officials to\nnotify a victim within seventy-two hours).\n2014] CRIME VICTIMS’ RIGHTS 103\nvictims. 255 The decision by state legislators to extend notification or\nconferral rights to crime victims demonstrates an express recognition that\ncrime victims’ meaningful participation in the criminal justice process may\ninvolve granting those victims rights before indictment.\nCONCLUSION\nCrime victims have important rights at stake in the criminal justice\nprocess, even before prosecutors formally file criminal charges. It is hardly\nsurprising, therefore, to find that a federal law that Congress in fact\ndesigned to create “broad and encompassing” rights for victims protects\nvictims during a criminal investigation. As this Article has explained,\ninterpreting the CVRA to cover crime victims during the pre-charging\nphase of a case is consistent with the statute’s purposes, text, legislative\nhistory, and interpretive case law. And state criminal justice systems also\nappear to be moving in that direction.\nThe Justice Department’s contrary interpretation seems unlikely to\nprevail when challenged. The CVRA signals a paradigm shift in the way\nthat crime victims are to be treated, at least within the federal criminal\njustice system. Before enactment of the law, federal investigators and\nprosecutors might have been able to keep victims at arm’s length, refusing\nto confer with them about the case and otherwise ignoring or even\nmistreating them during the process. But those days are over. The CVRA\npromises victims that they now have the right to confer with prosecutors\nand the right to be treated fairly while their cases are investigated. It is time\nfor the Department of Justice to recognize and embrace that new reality.\n255 See Jeffrey A. Parness et al., Monetary Recoveries for State Crime Victims, 58 CLEV.\nST. L.

It was filled with hay. At first, I thought the stirring\ninside was a family pet. Then, I saw it was a baby. I said nothing until we had\nleft. “Was that really a child?” I asked Yigal. “A baby?” He replied, with a tinge\nof sadness but also a look that seemed to convey surprise at my naivety: “Yes.\nThey don’t have room for him.”\n\nMy evolving feelings about the Arabs, the other people with dreams of what\nthey still saw as Palestine, would become more complex as my childhood drew\nto an end. As mentioned, I barely registered the fate of the absent villagers of\nWadi Khawaret.\n\nAnd yet as I got older — in my teens — I came to understand why the\nPalestinians were fighting us. Before the 1956 war, Dayan gave a brief speech\nthat had a powerful impact on me. It was a eulogy, but it was for someone\nDayan didn’t know personally. His intended audience was the rest of the\ncountry. He spoke in Nahal Oz, a kibbutz on the border with Gaza often\ntargeted by fedayeen. In April 1956, a group of Arabs crossed from Gaza and\nbegan cutting down the wheat in Nahal Oz’s fields. The kibbutz security officer,\na 21-year-old named Roi Rotberg, rode out on horseback to chase them away.\nThe intruders opened fire as soon as he got close. They beat him, shot him dead\nand took the body back over the armistice line. The corpse was returned,\nmutilated, after an Israeli protest through the UN.\n\nWith Israeli newspapers full of agonized accounts of what had happened,\nDayan’s message was that we should not blame the Arabs for Roi Rotberg’s\ndeath. We should look at ourselves, and the neighborhood in which we lived.\n“Why should we talk about their burning hatred for us?” he asked. “For eight\nyears, they have been sitting in the refugee camps of Gaza, while before their\neyes we have been transforming the lands and the villages where they and their\nfathers dwelt.” Of course, they hated us and the state we were building. Rotberg\nhad allowed his “yearning for peace to deafen his ears, and he did not hear the\nvoice of murder waiting in ambush.” Dayan said the danger was that other\nIsraelis had become similarly naive. “How did we shut our eyes, and refuse to\nsee, in all its brutality, the destiny of our generation?” A generation which was\n\n47\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_011518\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

We discussed etymology, traded literary recommendations, compared\nreligion -- I'm Unitarian, he’s a Baha'i convert. He lived one summer in Chicago, and we\ndiscovered that we'd shopped at the same bookstores.\n\nOne night, we found ourselves in the same nightclub. Using a cigarette as an excuse to go\noutside, we abandoned the music and talked for hours. Our friends came to check on us\nmultiple times, with varying degrees of smirking insinuation; we kept promising to go\nback in after one cigarette, then neglecting to actually smoke it. The conversation went\nthrough homesickness, ethics, roleplaying games, more literature. I lent him a book. He\npromised to visit me.\n\nHis next text message, a few days later, was plainly nervous. Can you imagine someone\nblurting a text message? That's what he did when he told me that he takes the \"no sex\nbefore marriage” part of his Baha'i faith seriously. I was stunned -- but I had to laugh,\ntoo. Of course Miss Clarisse Thorn, pro-sex advocate, just had to fixate on a man who\nwouldn't sleep with her!\n\nKK ok\n\nI did not undergo abstinence-only sex education. My middle school's health teachers were\nadmirably forthright and even hosted condom demonstrations in the auditorium, more\npower to 'em. I also had the good fortune to be raised Unitarian -- so I received incredibly\ncompassionate, complete sex education in Sunday School.\n\nStill, for a long time I was strongly attracted to chastity. In my teens, I decided that I\nwouldn't lose my virginity until I was much older -- I think I picked age 25 -- because I\nwanted to be sure I'd be mature enough to handle it. This resolution didn't last, but after I\nbecame sexually active, I occasionally came back to the idea. A few female friends took\n\"time off\" -- in some cases, full years of abstinence. I considered doing so myself,\nstrongly and for a long time.\n\nBack then, I was terrible at communicating about sex. Reading explicit sex scenes made\nme feel anxious, perhaps because I felt they set standards I couldn't \"perform.\" Talking\nexplicitly to my partners felt impossible, not least because I had practically no idea what I\nwanted. Worst of all, I could feel the societal boxes around my sexuality, but I couldn't\narticulate them. Plus, there were dark undercurrents to my sexuality that simply scared\nme. Abstinence was the only obvious way around my sex-negative cultural baggage!\n\nOnce I adjusted into my BDSM orientation, once I got a grip on how to circumvent some\nproblems with how Americans tend to think about sex, once I experienced mutual sexual\ncommunication that was totally trusting and adventurous... my attraction to chastity was\ngreatly reduced. These days, the idea only seems awesome when (a) I've just been\nromantically burned, or (b) I want more time to myself.\n\nIt's tempting to think that Mr. Chastity might be the same way: that he's uncomfortable\nfor similar reasons; that he'll \"get over it.\" Tempting -- and offensively presumptuous.\nMaybe he'll re-examine his motives someday, and maybe he won't. The important thing is\nto respect his feelings. So when he sent me that text, I did what any responsible sex-\npositive girl ought to do: I honored his boundaries and thought seriously about whether I\ncould work within them.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_018582\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

It's a chance to make the story about something other than you, while, at the same time, letting you \nframe your own story. Also, becoming an anti-Trump voice gives you a certain political cover which you \ndecidedly don't have now. Still, this necessary involves you going public. And so the most basic decision is \nabout your willingness to do that. My view is that in a couple of weeks you could master message and technical \nproficiency. I know a bunch of people who could be very helpful here. This would involve something along the \nlines of you writing an op-ed, doing a high profile television interview (Charlie Rose, I'd say), and perhaps \nsome social media efforts. \nSpeaking of which, again, I think a strategic plan, involving your public identity, philanthropic activities and \ninterests, and the development of media allies, ought finally to be put in place. A big, comprehensive, expensive \neffort. \nThe alternative is to continue to keep head down and hope Patterson book is just more he-said she-said and \nConnolly getting lost in the reeds (which, as an inveterate conspiracist, he always does). My worry is that \nPatterson can be counted on to produce a bestseller, and while he isn't regarded as a serious writer, he'll surely \nbe unloading a lot of tabloid copy. Because this will be tied to the election, the Trump-Clinton angle will amp \nup the attention 10-fold, in fact, possibly, a hundred fold. Possibly more than anything you've encountered \nbefore. \nMeanwhile--\nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 032248 \nIn a lawyer's letter, I'd suggest including the following points--not necessarily legal, but a warning about how a \npress campaign might unfold (publishers are more worried about being caught in negative media controversy \nthan they are of legal threats): \n1) Little, Brown has made on the record representations to at least one well-known journalist that it was not \npublishing a book by James Patterson about Jeffrey Epstein--possibly an effort to avoid inquiries about the \nquestionable nature of the book; \n2) The actual author of the book, John Connolly, is someone other than the stated author, James Patterson. \nConnolly is known to have developed an obsession with Epstein, such that, his longtime employer, Vanity Fair, \nhas refused to allow him to write about Epstein for the magazine; \n3) Sources have confirmed for us that Patterson has had little more than a minimal consulting role in the book, \nand that Connolly has functioned in every material way as the book's researcher and writer. We believe \nPatterson's \"authorship\" of the book will not stand up to scrutiny. And, indeed, that the entire notion of an \nextension of the Patterson franchise into nonfiction, as it has been used in fiction and children's book--\neffectively other authors writing under the Patterson name—presents a host of journalism ethical issues. \nplease note \nThe information contained in this communication is \nconfidential, may be attorney-client privileged, may \nconstitute inside information, and is intended only for \nthe use of the addressee.

But, if I were to list all these numbers\nin an enormous imaginary book it would hardly constitute knowing\neverything: I would be awash with numbers but not with knowledge.\n\nThe essential feature of ‘knowing’ is to have a small number of steps\nthat will definitely answer a problem. For example, if I wish to phone\nsomeone I can look up their details on my phone. The process will tell\nme their number in two or three steps. If you tell me the number is\nsomewhere in the phone book this is not knowledge. It could mean I\nneed an infinite number of steps.\n\nIf I accidentally deleted all the names in my phone - a nightmare\nscenario — and just had a print out of numbers would I still ‘know’ them?\nObviously I would recognize my mother’s number, but most of them\nwould be useless.

Peggy \nSiegal takes us behind the scenes where she got herself on camera along with a few of her famous friends. Nice work if you can get \nit. \nIn 1987, right after director Oliver Stone won the Academy Award for \"Platoon,\" he immediately turned to a domestic arena \nand began working on \"Wall Street\" in New York City where his father had been a stockbroker. Although the film was widely seen \nas a scathing critique of the culture of Wall Street, Stone has said that part of the film is a defense of capitalism, his father's vision of \nfinance (as seen through the Hal Holbrook character) and an homage to his father. \nAt the time Oliver was also fascinated with the connection between the psyche of Latino Miami drug dealers from his earlier \n\"Scarface\" script and the American-born 28- to 35-year-old, white collar stockbrokers. Both groups had an animalistic need to obtain \nbig and fast money. They shared an obsession with corruption and greed. \nOliver sent his actors to Bear Stearns for research, including then-newcomer Charlie Sheen, who played Bud Fox, a kid from \nnowhere. When he learns to cold call, and lands one big client, Gordon Gekko, Fox is thrust into the fast lane with a rock star \nfinancial mentor who teaches him corruption. \nOliver needed an old-fashioned villain to create drama, and he cast Michael Douglas as Gekko against type. Michael was not \nknown as a heavy at the time, but as a charming, handsome, sensitive leading man. Oliver also saw the anger, confidence, \nsalesmanship and style that Michael brought to the role. Michael's Gekko looked a bit like Laker's coach Pat Riley with his slicked \nback hair and well-cut suits, and it became Michael's most important role, winning him the Academy Award for the villain no one \ncould ever forget. \nWhen Gekko delivers his speech, \"Greed, for lack of a better word, is good. Greed is right. Greed works,\" cinematic history was \nmade. \n\"Wall Street\" was set in 1985, a time before ten financial news networks broadcasting 24/7 existed. The entire financial services \nindustry was largely unknown and Oliver Stone nailed it. \nFour years ago, Wall Street's producer Ed Pressman decided it was time for a sequel and met with Fox Film Entertainment co-\nchairmen Tom Rothman and Jim Gianopulos. Michael Douglas was immediately on-board pending script approval. Steven Schiff \nwrote the first script before the global economic crash of 2008 rendered it obsolete. \nAlan Loeb was brought in for a rewrite. Pressman asked me to meet Loeb at the Carlyle Hotel to explain the social rhythms of \nNew York's financial high society. Whereas Gekko 's character was modeled after '70s junk bond kings (Michael Milken) and '80s \nmergers and acquisitions killers (Henry Kravis), Loeb bases the new villain on hedge fund billionaires like John Paulson and Mike \nNovogratz, geniuses who have created stratospheric wealth beyond Gordon Gekko 's wildest dreams. When Oliver Stone agreed to \ndirect, he rewrote a portion of the script to focus on bankers as well as hedge funders, taking no screen credit. \nThis past September, Oliver yelled, \"action\" as Gordon Gekko, with long grey hair, comes back to life as he emerges from a \nlengthy prison stint shot outside of Sing Sing in Ossining, New York. Gekko is desperate to redefine himself in a different era. The \nNew York Post runs a full-page photo of Gekko and New Yorkers immediately become obsessed with the filming of Wall Street 2. \nA week into shooting, a glorious fall day. Ed Pressman invites me on the set at the Central Park Zoo. Oliver designs an elaborate \ntracking shot around the seal pool where Gekko, fresh from jail, walks and talks to Jake Moore, a young idealistic investment banker \nplayed by Shia LaBoeuf. They discuss Gekko's daughter Winnie, Moore's fiancee, played by Carrie Mulligan, who is also having an \noff-screen romance with LaBoeuf. Oliver played Cupid. Moore invites Gekko to the Alzheimer's Ball at the Metropolitan Museum \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 032000 \nof Art. Gekko, who used to be a sponsor or honoree of such events, cannot even afford a ticket. \nThe shot starts with a barking seal jumping for fish, then pans down to the actors. Extras weave in and out. In one take Michael \nmakes a wrong turn and ends up at the monkey house. Everyone laughs. The atmosphere on the set is courteous but quick and tense. \nThere is pressure when you are making a sequel to a hit. \nI watch the action on monitors while sitting on the producers canvas chairs with Pressman, Eric Kopeloff (\"Monsters Ball\") and \nCelia Costas, who was a location manager on the first \"Wall Street.\" They have asked me to be an extra in the Alzheimer's Ball scene \nand bring some friends to play rich Upper East Side socialites. Oliver wants over the top glam, go-to-the-vault jewels and couture \ngowns. \"Give me the night before the Titanic goes down,\" were his exact words. Not a problem. \nI pay a quick visit to Michael in his trailer on Fifth Avenue where he is resting. We go way back. I was his personal publicist \nwhen he won the Golden Globe and Oscar for Best Actor for \"Wall Street\" and we have remained great friends. Gekko is just as \nchallenging for him the second time because of endless pages of technical financial dialogue. We discuss Catherine Zeta-Jones' \nBroadway debut in a \"Little Night Music.\" Michael has a stack of partially finished handwritten thank you notes next to him for gifts \nreceived for their shared birthday party on September 25th at the St. Regis. Her 40th and his 65th. \nI tell him I have been cast as an extra in two scenes and he laughs knowing I am desperate to hang around him and the \nproduction. \n8:30 a.m. on Wednesday, October 21st, another warm, stunning fall day. I report to the wardrobe trailer on 65th Street and \nMadison Avenue. I carry four elaborate cocktail dresses and bags of matching accessories. My hair is in rollers. Statuesque Julia \nKoch walks over from her Park Avenue apartment carrying her white Valentino and long diamond earrings. Her real-life financial \ntitan husband David is unaware where she is this morning. \nVanity Fair's keeper of the Best Dressed List, Amy Fine Collins, arrives totally organized in turquoise vintage Geoffrey Beene, \nand Vogue's fashion editor Hamish Bowles wears a riot of plaids, patterns and a large yellow fake flower on his lapel. Costume \nDesigner Ellen Mirojnick, who created Gordon Gekko's rich slick look in the first film, is ecstatic with the extras I invited. \nOliver is shooting a scene with Josh Brolin (the star of Stone's \"W\"). His character Bretton (never Bret) James, a ruthless Wall \nStreet kingpin, and his perfect wife Samantha (Noelle Beck) are hosting a benefit piano recital for a 13-year-old child prodigy in their \nhuge, art-filled townhouse at 41 East 65th Street. The building actually belongs to Baby Jane Holzer, a wealthy art collector still \nfamous for hanging with Andy Warhol in the '60s. The production designer had Jane's fabulous Warhols moved to storage and \nreplaced with matching photographic copies. Very expensive contemporary art is again an important production element of Oliver's \nvision. \nAt 10:30 a.m., all the extras are placed around the living room set. Oliver's French mother, Jacqueline Stone, and her friend \nMonique Van Vooren, both in their 80s, are seated in front of the fireplace chatting in French. Production assistants fuss over them. \nDebonair macho man Chuck Pfieffer, who appeared in the original film, and I immediately invent a back story—I am his corporate \nwife—and we position ourselves on a couch next to the director's mother. Julia gets the best spot close to the piano and Amy, \nHamish and decorator Geoffrey Bradfield are right behind her. Josh is brought in and the kibitzing stops. \nOliver appears on the set with eagle eyes and a sly grin and quickly re-positions everyone. He explains the scene, gives out lines \nto his favored extras, and on his way out to the monitors in the next room mentions that my earrings are too small. Wardrobe \njumps. Josh rehearses and Oliver finally yells, \"Action.\" The kid plays the piano, Josh explains why we are in his home, asks for \nmoney, the camera dollies as extras say their lines and Shia appears at the door uninvited for a confrontation with Josh. Three hours \nlater a PA yells, \"Lunch\". \nIn costume, Amy, Hamish and I run to The Monkey Bar. I am late to meet \"The Harpies,\" including Liz Smith, Barbara \nWalters, Cynthia McFadden, Nora Ephron, Jennifer Isham, Maury Perl and Beth Kseniak. \nGraydon Carter is at the next table. I tell him Oliver Stone wants him in \"Wall Street 2\" as an extra. (I make this up.) Graydon \njokes that he only works with lines. I say, \"Not a problem.\" (This will be news to Oliver.) \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 032001 \nBack on the set I tell Oliver that Graydon is willing to be in the film with lines. Oliver finds that intriguing. \nOliver shoots the piano recital scene over and over again from different angles all afternoon. Financial wizard Don Marron \nsaunters on the set to visit and Oliver spontaneously puts him in a scene chatting with Josh. Carrie Mulligan hangs out watching \nboyfriend Shia work. \nAt sundown Julia Koch has to race from reel to real life and explain to her husband where she has been all day. (He loves it.) \nChuck Pfieffer plants a \"Page Six\" item and the next day socialites begin calling me to get into the film. \nThursday, November 5, Shun Lee Restaurant, West 65th Street \nOliver shoots a crowded tight interior scene with Michael, Carrie and Shia, who are having an intimate Chinese dinner. \nSpontaneously, Oliver decides this is the perfect scene for Graydon Carter. After a flurry of calls, Graydon arrives on set, and playing \nhimself, sashays by the table. Gekko jumps up to say hello and Graydon brushes him off with a few dismissive lines. \nMonday, November 9, 25 Broadway \nOne hundred swells show up at the former Canard Shipping building, a massive Italianate hall, at the crack of dawn for the \nAlzheimer's Ball, a grand charity event. \nSusan Hess and I are chauffeured downtown with our Vera Wang gowns and report to the VIP extra holding area where we join \nPrince Dimitri of Yugoslavia in a bespoke dinner jacket, journalist Christopher Mason, songstress Yanna Avis, photographer Kelly \nKlein, art dealer Larry Gagosian's girl friend Shala Monroque in see-through Rodarte, beauty executive Olivia Chantecaille, producer \nLawrence Robins, author Jackie Weld Drake, Vogue film critic Joan Juliet Buck, fashion consultant Jill Fairchild, CNN's Felicia \nTaylor and Italian newsman Mario Calvo-Platero. \nEllen Mirojnick and her costume department have assembled racks of the most expensive elaborate designer gowns and work at \nbreak neck speed styling while we wildly strip to our undies in a makeshift dressing area. Ellen pours me into a black tulle Marchesa \nwith a enormous wired silver bow. Twenty hairdressers and make-up artists systematically work on 250 extras. A mile of tables are \nalternately filled with steaming coffee, fattening breakfast foods, hair sprays, mirrors, shoes and jewelry. It's a madhouse of \nexcitement. \nWe are led to the part of the set used for the cocktail reception and placed around Michael Douglas and Charlie Sheen stand-ins. \nCharlie has been flown in from LA for half a days work to reprise his original character. He is now the highest paid television actor \ncommanding two million dollars an episode of \"Two and a Half Men.\" \nOliver arrives on the set greeting, examining, tweaking the shot and always pulling the prettiest girls closest to the \ncamera. Michael and Charlie arrive from their trailers and run their lines as socials drift into their sight lines challenging their \nconcentration on pages of dialogue. Oliver yells, \"Action\" as the extras aggressively jockey for face time. Charlie is not having an \neasy day and they do take after take. My corporate husband Chuck Pfieffer has gotten his real girlfriend Lisa Crosby in the film and \nmy marriage has become a threesome. \nSensing our concern of not making it onto the silver screen Oliver tells his first assistant director to seat a dinner table with \nSusan Hess, Jill Fairchild, Prince Dimitri, Chuck Pfieffer, Grace Meigher and Mario Calvo-Platero. He directs us to chat with each \nother turning left and right as the camera closely pans past our faces. \nElsewhere on the set are John Buffalo Mailer, as Shia's character's best friend, Austin Pendleton, 94-year-old Eli Wallach and \nNatalie Morales. Also in this film are: the magnificent Frank Langella, as Shia's boss, who throws himself in front of a train early in \nthe film, Susan Sarandon as Shia's real-estate broker mother, Sylvia Miles, who reprises her hilarious cameo as another real-estate \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 032002 \nagent and Jean Pigozzi as an international banker. \nLunch is called at 4 p.m. and Michael Douglas takes seven heavily made-up and bejeweled women including Susan, Jill and me \nto a restaurant around the corner. Gordon Gekko hosts a hen party talking about children, schools, country houses and vacations. \nBack on the set Oliver is shooting the actual dinner. Assistant directors ask for volunteers to dance to the live music. Prince \nDimitri twirls and dips Jackie Weld. Kelly Klein, in her own Karl Lagerfeld sheer black organza, watches from a table with scattered \nchampagne glasses half-filled with apple juice along with her 86-year-old father, Tulley Rector. Charlie Sheen leaves for LA and \nShia is very annoyed he was not introduced to his hero. Carrie Mulligan, costumed like Audrey Hepburn, chats with us between \ntakes. \nThe final set up is a long tracking shot of Josh Brolin and his wife as they triumphantly enter the ball. It is close to 9 p.m. and \nLord William Astor arrives to pick me up for Amalia Dayan and Adam Lindemann's dinner for artists uptown. \nOliver is introduced to William and delights in calling him Lord as he immediately moves him into the top of the shot and \ninstructs him to tell Eli Wallach, \"We must do lunch\". Ever the proper English gentleman, William advises Oliver that Lords do not \nuse American slang and improvises his own lines. The tracking shot continues for numerous takes following Josh and Noelle as \nevery VIP extra gets another shot at instant stardom with one-line greetings. \nAt last, \"It's a wrap\" is screamed after 10 p.m. Prince Dimitri tells The Wall Street Journal it was, \"a day of electrifying \nglamour,\" and \"the longest gala of my life. I was in black tie for thirteen hours.\" \nNovember 25, Tommy Gun Salon, Ludlow Street, last day of shooting \nDonald Trump is on set at 7 a.m. ready for his close up. He is trying to make a mid-day departure on his jet from Teterboro \nwith wife Melania and son Baron for Thanksgiving weekend in Palm Beach. Back in September, Oliver had invited Donald Trump to \ndinner at \"21\" to meet his leading men Josh and Shia so they could observe New York's most charismatic powerbroker in his natural \nenvironment. \nThe scene is London so the grey skies are perfect. Gekko has moved abroad to make his financial comeback. The scene opens \non the back of his head in a barber's chair as he watches the financial news on TV. The camera pulls back and Gordon Gekko is \nfinally revealed as the powerful bull he once was in an exquisite suit and signature slicked-back hair. Donald Trump walks into the \nshop for a cut and the banter begins about the money market. From his chair, Donald leans into Michael and suggests a \"comb over\" \nlike his famous do. Gekko, with a slight grin, says, \"No thanks Donald, I am a gel man.\" \nThe crew is yucking it up and Donald feels great. Paparazzi shoot the whole scene with long lenses from across the street.

You would not be\nable to do a competing book or documentary before then. This is not to say that they shouldn't be pursued. In a\nsense, better that they know what Patterson's position is and, a year from now say, be able to counter it. I have\nsome thoughts on book and doc to share at your convenience.\n\nThat being said, you do need an immediate counter narrative to the book. I believe Trump offers an ideal\nopportunity. It's a chance to make the story about something other than you, while, at the same time, letting\nyou frame your own story. Also, becoming an anti-Trump voice gives you a certain political cover which you\ndecidedly don't have now. Still, this necessary involves you going public. And so the most basic decision is\nabout your willingness to do that. My view is that in a couple of weeks you could master message and\ntechnical proficiency. I know a bunch of people who could be very helpful here. This would involve something\nalong the lines of you writing an op-ed, doing a high profile television interview (Charlie Rose, I'd say), and\nperhaps some social media efforts.\n\nSpeaking of which, again, I think a strategic plan, involving your public identity, philanthropic activities and\ninterests, and the development of media allies, ought finally to be put in place. A big, comprehensive,\nexpensive effort.\n\nThe alternative is to continue to keep head down and hope Patterson book is just more he-said she-said and\nConnolly getting lost in the reeds (which, as an inveterate conspiracist, he always does). My worry is that\nPatterson can be counted on to produce a bestseller, and while he isn't regarded as a serious writer, he'll surely\nbe unloading a lot of tabloid copy. Because this will be tied to the election, the Trump-Clinton angle will amp\nup the attention 10-fold, in fact, possibly, a hundred fold. Possibly more than anything you've encountered\nbefore.\n\nMeanwhile--\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_032858\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

Emphasize Strengths, Don’t Fix Weaknesses.\n\nMost people are good at a handful of things and utterly miserable at most. I am great at product creation\nand marketing but terrible at most of the things that follow.\n\nMy body is designed to lift heavy objects and throw them, and that’s it. I ignored this for a long time.\nI tried swimming and looked like a drowning monkey. I tried basketball and looked like a caveman.\nThen I became a fighter and took off.\n\nIt is far more lucrative and fun to leverage your strengths instead of attempting to fix all the chinks in\nyour armor. The choice is between multiplication of results using strengths or incremental improvement\nfixing weaknesses that will, at best, become mediocre. Focus on better use of your best weapons instead\nof constant repair.\n\n7. Things in Excess Become Their Opposite.\n\nIt is possible to have too much of a good thing. In excess, most endeavors and possessions take on the\ncharacteristics of their opposite. Thus:\n\nPacifists become militants.\nFreedom fighters become tyrants.\nBlessings become curses.\n\nHelp becomes hindrance. More becomes less +\n\nToo much, too many, and too often of what you want becomes what you don’t want. This is true of\npossessions and even time. Lifestyle Design is thus not interested in creating an excess of idle time,\nwhich is poisonous, but the positive use of free time, defined simply as doing what you want as opposed\nto what you feel obligated to do.\n\n8. Money Alone Is Not the Solution.\n\nThere is much to be said for the power of money as currency (I’m a fan myself), but adding more of it\njust isn’t the answer as often as we’d like to think. In part, it’s laziness. “If only I had more money” is\nthe easiest way to postpone the intense self-examination and decision-making necessary to create a life\nof enjoyment—now and not later. By using money as the scapegoat and work as our all-consuming\nroutine, we are able to conveniently disallow ourselves the time to do otherwise: “John, I'd love to talk\nabout the gaping void I feel in my life, the hopelessness that hits me like a punch in the eye every time I\nstart my computer in the moming, but I have so much work to do! I’ve got at least three hours of\nunimportant e-mail to reply to before calling the prospects who said ‘no’ yesterday. Gotta run!”\n\nBusy yourself with the routine of the money wheel, pretend it’s the fix-all, and you artfully create a\nconstant distraction that prevents you from seeing just how pointless it is. Deep down, you know it’s all\nan illusion, but with everyone participating in the same game of make-believe, it’s easy to forget.\n\nThe problem is more than money.\n\n9. Relative Income Is More Important Than Absolute Income.\n\nAmong dietitians and nutritionists, there is some debate over the value of a calorie. Is a calorie a calorie,\nmuch like a rose is a rose? Is fat loss as simple as expending more calories than you consume, or is the\nsource of those calories important? Based on work with top athletes, I know the answer to be the latter.\n\nWhat about income? Is a dollar is a dollar is a dollar? The New Rich don’t think so.\nLet’s look at this like a fifth-grade math problem. Two hardworking chaps are headed toward each\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_013821\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

They recruited Conway in 2015 to work on the Cruz campaign, when Trump\nwas still far from the conservative ideal, and then, in August 2016, inserted her into the\nTrump campaign.\n\nShe understood her role. “I will only ever call you Mr. Trump,” she told the candidate\nwith perfect-pitch solemnity when he interviewed her for the job. It was a trope she would\nrepeat in interview after interview—Conway was a catalog of learned lines—a message\nrepeated as much for Trump as for others.\n\nHer title was campaign manager, but that was a misnomer. Bannon was the real\nmanager, and she was the senior pollster. But Bannon shortly replaced her in that role and\nshe was left in what Trump saw as the vastly more important role of cable spokesperson.\n\nConway seemed to have a convenient On-Off toggle. In private, in the Off position, she\nseemed to regard Trump as a figure of exhausting exaggeration or even absurdity—or, at\nleast, if you regarded him that way, she seemed to suggest that she might, too. She\nillustrated her opinion of her boss with a whole series of facial expressions: eyes rolling,\nmouth agape, head snapping back. But in the On position, she metamorphosed into\nbeliever, protector, defender, and handler. Conway is an antifeminist (or, actually, in a\ncomplicated ideological somersault, she sees feminists as being antifeminists), ascribing\nher methods and temperament to her being a wife and mother. She’s instinctive and\nreactive. Hence her role as the ultimate Trump defender: she verbally threw herself in\nfront of any bullet coming his way.\n\nTrump loved her defend-at-all-costs shtick. Conway’s appearances were on his\nschedule to watch live. His was often the first call she got after coming off the air. She\nchanneled Trump: she said exactly the kind of Trump stuff that would otherwise make her\nput a finger-gun to her head.\n\nAfter the election—Trump’s victory setting off a domestic reordering in the Conway\nhousehold, and a scramble to get her husband an administration job—Trump assumed she\nwould be his press secretary. “He and my mother,” Conway said, “because they both\nwatch a lot of television, thought this was one of the most important jobs.” In Conway’s\nversion, she turned Trump down or demurred. She kept proposing alternatives in which\nshe would be the key spokesperson but would be more as well. In fact, almost everyone\nelse was maneuvering Trump around his desire to appoint Conway.\n\nLoyalty was Trump’s most valued attribute, and in Conway’s view her kamikaze-like\nmedia defense of the president had earned her a position of utmost primacy in the White\nHouse. But in her public persona, she had pushed the boundaries of loyalty too far; she\nwas so hyperbolic that even Trump loyalists found her behavior extreme and were\nrepelled.

Is knowledge generation simply a\nnumbers game?\n\nLeo Tolstoy’s War and Peace is generally assumed to be the longest\nnovel ever written. This is not quite true. Wikipedia reckons the longest\nnovel is a French book, Artamene, with over 2.1 million words. Tolstoy\ncomes in sixteenth, with a mere half million!\n\nWritten in 1869, War and Peace tells the story of five Russian families\nduring the Napoleonic wars. Originally written in a mixture of Russian\nand French, and numbering over 500,000 words, it was quickly translated\nto other languages. The mistress of composer Franz Liszt translated it\nfully into French, where it expands to 550,000 words. Contrary to popular\nmyth the length of the book drops slightly in German. If you really want\nto save paper Chinese is best. Because\nit uses a single symbol per word, the\nChinese translation needs only 750,000\ncharacters compared with the 3 million\nfor English. It is wrong to assume this\nis necessarily more efficient than a\nphonetic language. Although it might\nsave on paper, it is considerably more\nlaborious to write. Three strokes are\nrequired to write ‘war in English\nwhereas the Chinese pictogram\nrequires ten.\n\nComputers work with numbers. It is a simple process to translate\na book into numbers because books are composed of discrete symbols.\nAll we need do is give each symbol a unique number and record those\nnumbers in digital format.

USA!\n“We as a country, made up of flawed people, come together as one of the greatest countries on Earth, because\nwe are a nation of laws,” he said, according to a transcript of the proceedings. “This was about hard work and\nwhat happens when your work is destroyed and taken, how you're entitled to be treated under the laws of the\nUnited States.”\n\nFor Ruemmler, the appeal was not emotional or jingoistic. It was rational all the way.\n\nHer first line: “Mr. Bajwa has come up with an interesting story, but it's not what happened.”\n\nAnd then, in the most matter-of-fact, conversational way, she annihilated his case.\n\n“There are at least five fatal flaws in Mr. Bajwa's case, and any one of those alone sinks his case. Any one,”\nshe said, according to the transcript.\n\nBajwa couldn’t prove that SpanCash was ever fully functional and commercially ready, Ruemmler said. In\nfact, she argued, it was never even a real product.\n\nFurther, she said, Bajwa didn’t prove that the technology or platform was comprised of any trade secrets; or\nthat Emirates Bank stole SpanCash; or that it ever used it. Finally, Bajwa didn’t prove InfoSpan suffered any\ndamages, she said.\n\nSome of her turns of phrase are refreshingly non-lawyerly. ““Sham is going down there... It's not as if these\nguys were exactly rubes...This is some flimflam thing... One of the many, many dog-ate-my-homework\nexcuses....This is an absolute double-down lie.”\n\nThe overall effect: she simplified without being condescending.\n\nBut there was still a hurdle for Emirates. Or as Latham’s Schecter put it in an interview, “There are some facts\nwe wouldn’t script.”\n\nAfter the bank terminated its agreement with InfoSpan and demanded its investment back, Infospan’s deputy\nCEO, Larry Scudder, was arrested when he tried to leave the UAE.\n\n“At the Dubai Airport that day, the Dubai police arrested Mr. Scudder after he presented his passport at an\nelectronic terminal. Police told Mr. Scudder that a charge of criminal fraud had been filed against him for\n$1,465,000. Mr. Scudder was handcuffed and marched through the airport and then held in police detention\nfacilities and interrogated,” the complaint states.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_012039\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

An out-of-\ncontrol arms race in lethal autonomous weapons that drives the price of automated\nanonymous assassination toward zero will be very hard to stop once it gains momentum.\nThe second goal would require reversing the current trend in some Western countries\nwhere sectors of the population are getting poorer in absolute terms, fueling anger,\nresentment, and polarization. Unless the third goal can be met, all the wonderful AI\ntechnology we create might harm us, either accidentally or deliberately.\n\nAI safety research must be carried out with a strict deadline in mind: Before AGI\narrives, we need to figure out how to make AI understand, adopt, and retain our goals.\nThe more intelligent and powerful machines get, the more important it becomes to align\ntheir goals with ours. As long as we build relatively dumb machines, the question isn’t\nwhether human goals will prevail but merely how much trouble the machines can cause\nbefore we solve the goal-alignment problem. If a superintelligence 1s ever unleashed,\nhowever, it will be the other way around: Since intelligence is the ability to accomplish\ngoals, a superintelligent AI is by definition much better at accomplishing its goals than\nwe humans are at accomplishing ours, and will therefore prevail.\n\nIn other words, the real risk with AGI isn’t malice but competence. A\nsuperintelligent AGI will be extremely good at accomplishing its goals, and if those goals\naren’t aligned with ours, we’re in trouble. People don’t think twice about flooding\nanthills to build hydroelectric dams, so let’s not place humanity in the position of those\nants. Most researchers argue that if we end up creating superintelligence, we should\nmake sure it’s what Al-safety pioneer Eliezer Yudkowsky has termed “friendly AI’—AI\nwhose goals are in some deep sense beneficial.\n\nThe moral question of what these goals should be is just as urgent as the technical\nquestions about goal alignment. For example, what sort of society are we hoping to\ncreate, where we find meaning and purpose in our lives even though we, strictly\nspeaking, aren’t needed? I’m often given the following glib response to this\nquestion: “Let’s build machines that are smarter than us and then let them figure out the\nanswer!” This mistakenly equates intelligence with morality. Intelligence isn’t good or\nevil but morally neutral. It’s simply an ability to accomplish complex goals, good or bad.\nWe can’t conclude that things would have been better if Hitler had been more intelligent.\nIndeed, postponing work on ethical issues until after goal-aligned AGI is built would be\nirresponsible and potentially disastrous. A perfectly obedient superintelligence whose\ngoals automatically align with those of its human owner would be like Nazi SS-\nObersturmbannfithrer Adolf Eichmann on steroids. Lacking moral compass or\ninhibitions of its own, it would, with ruthless efficiency, implement its owner’s goals,\nwhatever they might be.!?\n\nWhen I speak of the need to analyze technology risk, ’m sometimes accused of\nscaremongering.

Written in 1987, this book is a classic among American business\nbooks and has influenced a generation of entrepreneurs.

New\nYork City tried for six years to fix it, spent $13 million, and the rink still was not ready to open. In June of\n1986 Trump, who could see the rink from his apartment, finally got tired of the embarrassment and offered\nto fix the rink at his own expense. At first the city turned him down because its bureaucracy did not want to\nbe embarrassed by someone fixing something they couldn’t fix. Trump kept pushing and finally out of\nembarrassment the city gave in.\n\n>>\n\n>> The key part of the story is Trump’s reaction to being put in charge. He promptly recognized that he\ndidn’t know anything about fixing a skating rink. He asked himself who built a lot of skating rinks.\n“Canadians!” he concluded. He found the best Canadian ice skating rink construction company. When the\nCanadians flew in to assess the situation, they were amazed at how bad the city had been at solving the\nproblem. They assured Trump that this was an easy job. Trump fixed the six year embarrassment two\nmonths ahead of schedule and nearly $800,000 under-budget.

But in the ideological dialect of the\nCommunist Party, it seems to mean several things. First, that there is nothing random about\nwhat is unfolding in the world today. Second, these reflect certain immutable laws of political\nand economic development. Third, the business of Chinese foreign policy is to use this dialectal\nprism to understand precisely what is happening in the world today, why it is happening and\nwhat to do about it. And fourth, applying these disciplines to the current period, it means that\nthe global order is at a turning point with the relative decline of the US and the West, with\nthis coinciding with the fortuitous national and international circumstances currently enabling\nChina’s rise.\n\nTo use Xi’s own language, this: “has been in the best period of development since modern\ntimes, while the world is undergoing the most profound and unprecedented changes in a\ncentury” adding that “the two aspects are intertwined and interact with each other.” Xi refers\nto the current period as a period of unprecedented strategic opportunity for China and the\ncurrent mission of the party. Although this is not itself a new term, Xi says the party’s mission\nis to extend this period. To do this, he calls for the party to engage in “in-depth analysis of\nthe law of how the international situation changes as the world comes into this transitional\nperiod, as well as developing an accurate grasp of the basic characteristics of the external\nenvironment China is facing at this historical juncture in order to better plan and facilitate the\ncountry's work on foreign affairs.”\n\nIn other words, what is being said here is that China now has the wind at its back. Of course\nthere are formidable obstacles ahead. But a dialectical analysis of history causes China to\nconclude that the forces of reaction facing the US and the West are greater. Just as the\ncontradictions operating domestically within the US and the West (in their particular political\nsystems) are greater as well. Which in turn renders China’s overall domestic and international\ncircumstances much better by comparison in the emerging contest between the two. All of\nwhich, again in this view, pushes towards a new historical synthesis more in China’s (and\nChinese socialism’s) favour.\n\nYou will all be forgiven if you think this all sounds more like medieval theology than modern\ninternational relations. And it’s anyone’s guess what any of this actually will have to do with\nconcrete foreign policy reality. But we often forget that how one-party states, and in particular\nMarxist states, choose to ‘ideate’ reality actually matters.

I was one of ten\nnew recruits, bringing the size of the sayeret to twenty. We were almost all\nteenagers. In fact, the oldest of our officers was 21. Most of the men were\nSephardi Jews. For a unit like ours, with the aim of undertaking secret missions\nin Arab countries, Avraham believed that a background in Arabic culture and\nlanguage was an important asset. I was the sayeret’s only lock-picker. But all of\nus had been recruited in the much same way that I was. It was how the top\nPalmach units had been formed, and the way Sharon assembled Unit 101:\nfriends recommending friends, in my case, my old yeled chutz schoolmate from\nthe kibbutz.\n\nWe trained in the whole range of commando skills. We used not only Uzis,\nbut Soviet-made Kalashnikovs and Gurionov machine guns. We worked with\ndetonators and explosives. We staged raids on Israeli airfields. We conducted\nexercises using rubber dinghies to practice attacking from the sea. But mostly\nwe walked. For hundreds of miles, almost always at night the length and breadth\nof the country. We would study a map of each area, committing every town or\nvillage, hilltop or dry creek bed, to memory before we set off. I can still\nremember what Meir Har-Zion told us: to be truly prepared, you needed to\nspend “an hour for an hour” — an equal time mastering the lay of the land to the\namount you’d need to carry out an operation. It was a gruelling regime —\ndesigned to push us to the very limits of endurance. On one series of exercises,\nwe were limited to a single canteen of water as we trekked deep into the Negev\nDesert. It was gruelling, designed to push us to the very limits of endurance. I\nremember the first time Errol set eyes on me after I joined the unit. He turned to\nAvraham, laughed, and said: “Are we taking high school kids now?” But before\nlong, I was a “high school kid” no longer.\n\nMeir Har-Zion rarely took a direct part in our exercises. On his final\nCompany A mission, a month before the 1956 war, he had been shot in his\nthroat and arm. A medic saved his life by performing a tracheotomy. But his\nspeech was affected, and he still had almost no use of his right arm. Errol,\nMicha Kapusta and Yitzhak Gibli were more actively involved with us.

The\nmap and compass helped. But I soon realized that it was almost impossible to\nget an accurate reading from inside the truck. Every few minutes, I waved the\nconvoy to stop, got out, and walked fifty or sixty yards into the sand and clumps\nof acacia trees and calibrated our progress from there. My fallback was the\nstars. From them, I could at least make sure we were headed in broadly the right\ndirection. But the need to navigate around the dunes meant we were never\nmoving in a perfectly straight line. The miles ticking by on the truck’s odometer\ncouldn’t tell me exactly how far we’d travelled. A couple of times, I realized we\nwere wandering off line — not by a much, but enough to risk leaving us either a\nmile or two south of where we were supposed to go or, worse, on the Egyptian\nside of an unmarked desert frontier that, especially at night, would look pretty\nmuch the same on either side.\n\nFinally, a few hours before dawn, I brought the convoy to a halt. I climbed\nout, walked back to the staff sergeant and told him, with more confidence than I\nfelt: “We’re here.” I had no way of knowing for sure. But I felt we were\ngenerally in the right place. Before we’d set off, I was briefed by the officer in\ncharge of one of the operational APC battalions. He had been to the area before,\non training exercises. Because of the emergency call-up, he was too senior to\nlead a supply convoy. But he told me that once we got there, we should stop and\nwait. He would follow our tracks the next morning and link up with us. An hour\nafter sunrise, we saw his jeep bobbing over the sand towards us. He pulled to a\nstop, shook hands with the staff sergeant, and then he turned to me.\n“Unbelievable,” he said. ““We’re where we need to be.”\n\nOur role in the grand scheme of things, and certainly mine, was hardly\ndecisive. But the rest of the border mobilization also went to plan. That, along\nwith some frantic diplomatic activity and a healthy common sense on all sides,\nensured that a new war with Egypt was averted — at least for a further half-\ndozen years, until 1967. By then, the lesson of Rotem would be learned: our\nneed to find a realiable way to tap into the battle plans of the hostile Arab states\naround us.

I’d guess that it will be many decades before engineering\ncatches up, but—barring catastrophic wars, climate change, or plagues, so that\ntechnological progress stays vigorous—few centuries.\n\nIf that’s right, we can look forward to several generations during which humans,\nempowered and augmented by smart devices, coexist with increasingly capable\nautonomous Als.

Given the intrinsic advantages that engineered devices\nwill eventually offer, the vanguard of that evolution will be cyborgs and superminds,\nrather than lightly adorned Homo sapiens.\n\nAnother important impetus will come from the exploration of hostile\nenvironments, both on Earth (e.g., the deep ocean) and, especially, in space. The human\nbody is poorly adapted to conditions outside a narrow band of temperatures, pressures,\nand atmospheric composition. It needs a wide variety of specific, complex nutrients, and\nplenty of water. Also, it is not radiation-hardened.

The allegations first surfaced in British newspapers, which have\nzeroed in on Epstein’s friendship with Prince Andrew, who has recently tried to publicly disassociate himself from his\nold pal.\n\nI wrote a piece for Vanity Fair in 2003 called “The Talented Mr. Epstein.” It was largely a business piece that focused\non his mysterious exit from Bear Stearns in 1981, his close relationships with Jimmy Cayne, Les Wexner, the\nchairman of Limited Brands, and above all, the man who claimed to be his mentor, Steven Jude Hoffenberg, who is\ncurrently serving a 20-year-jail sentence for bilking investors in Towers Financial out of $450 million.\n\nThe piece alluded to Epstein’s great friendship with Maxwell, and how she introduced him to young women with\nwhom he had sexual relationships. But, in the end, the story didn’t really go there, focusing instead on the issue that\nremains a mystery—how Jeffrey made his money, and how Ghislaine made hers.\n\nThis is not to say I didn’t hear stories about the girls. I did. But, not knowing quite who to believe, I concentrated on\n\nthe intriguing financial mystery instead. But now the women have come back. Not the same ones, different ones.

For the rest of the night he was\noddly quiet and asked to be dropped off at his parent’s house, I was more\nthan obliged to do so. I couldn’t stand the sight of him let alone want to\nbe around him tonight. Being so revved up it didn’t yet dawn on me that\nsomething wasn’t right. The next morning I was woken up by an alerting\nphone call, | had the manager from the restaurant where I worked, on the\nother end screaming at me and asking where the money is. I sat up in bed,\ncompletely awake now, and asked him back, “What are you talking\nabout, what money?” His tone had calmed a bit and he could hear the\neamestly in my voice and explained his accusations “The tip jar was\nempty after you had left last night and there was over a hundred and fifty\ndollars in there, now it’s missing”. The answer hit me instantly and I got\na terrible knot in my stomach...T.J. When I left him at the bar not even\nthinking about the tip bowl to talk with the manager, he saw an\nopportunity to fund more drugs and he took it. That’s why he didn’t even\nwant to come back to my apartment last night. It was all too clear for me\nnow and I tried to explain to my manager about my boyfriend’s sickness\nand asked him to take the lost money out of my wages. “I have no choice\nbut to let you go and file a police report for the missing money”. I\ncouldn’t believe what I was hearing. How did things tum upside down so\nquickly? I exclaimed “Even though I’m paying you from my pocket for\nmoney I didn’t even steal and you’ve never even had any problems from\nme before?”. His apologies were short and icy, nothing that could be\ndone. I slammed down the receiver only to pick it up again to dial T.J’s\nparents house and to no surprise he hadn’t slept there last night and was\nnot able to be reached. J felt like I was in a bad dream I couldn’t wake up\nfrom and with no money to pay rent, eat, or even survive, | was back to\nthe drawing board.\n\nThe week passed without hearing from T.J, he was in hiding, for now.\nWhen the phone rang early one morning [ expected it to be him, instead it\nwas a surprise phone call from a familiar voice. Jeffrey decided to give\nme a call to invite me over to his Palm Beach mansion for some lunch\nand to catch up, it really was just his way of finding out if | was cleaned\nup and ready to come back to work for him. With my life in chaos once\nagain and having to borrow money off my parents for grocery food, I saw\na quick solution to my situation and was even convinced this is what I\nhad to do to take care of myself.\n\nHe greeted me at the door and led me inside. Ghislane was at her usual\nspot, her desk working away, and we headed past her with a quick wave\nand lip-synced a “Hello”, not wanting to disturb her important sounding\nphone call. She glanced up quickly and gave a brisk wave my way, then\nput her attention back to the computer. Once we were inside the poolside\ncabana, which was Jeffrey’s office, & gym, Jeffrey took a seat behind his\n\n85\n\n\\ Copyright Protected Material\nCONFIDENTIAL GIUFFREO0$218\n\ndesk and told me to have a seat across from him. He took a sip of water\nfrom an already poured glass and asked if I'd like some. “Yes, Thank\nyou” My reply was short and polite, already just wanting to get this\nmeeting done and over with. His face was like steel and his expressions\nwere stern, I felt like a child in trouble sitting in the principles office.\n\nHe cut straight to the chase wanting to know “Are you on drugs\nanymore?” There was a moment’s pause as | took a deep breath and told\nhim the entire truth. “I got really depressed for awhile and coped with my\nemotions by blanketing them with mind-altering substances. Just smoking\najay to relax wasn’t good enough anymore. | needed to be high and\nflying to believe I was happy and dealing with all of life’s curveballs.\nSnorting things like coke and popping amphetamines replaced my\nsorrows with an overflow of endorphins, making it possible to keep up\nwith everything, until | would come down and the cycle just kept on\nrepeating itself”.\n\nHe listened to me continue to tell him about the good things that have\ncome from the break. Like my dog, yoga, and working at a restaurant,\nmaking lots of new friends but most of all, I got my smile back, without\nthe drugs this time. He was really happy to hear the upside of everything,\nbut there was one thing I was reluctant to tell him about. My recent\ntravail that T.J effortlessly caused at the restaurant where I was so happily\nemployed. As my manager had warned he had to file a police report\nstating that after I had left, the tips were gone, putting the blame solely on\nme.\n\nGiving Jeffrey a clear picture of the entire ordeal he exclaimed “What\nare you doing with this idiot Jenna, he is no good for you! I know you can\ndo better for yourself, why do you let him drag you down every time?”\nNodding my head in concurrence I went on to finish my epic drama. “T\nreceived a phone call from the PBCP asking me to come in about the\nmoney, I told them what happened over the phone but they still want me\nto come in. I don’t want to have a record for something I never did or\never would do!’ I put my face into my hands and covered the tears now\ntrickling down my cheeks. “I just can’t believe this is happening to me\nwhen everything has been going so uphill, now I’m out of work and in\ntrouble” I wiped my face and looked up at him “ What do I do?” Enabling\nhim as my mentor once again, his sly grin said it all.

Repeat the process with the 12-month timeline if desired.\n\n5. Determine the cost of these dreams and calculate your Target Monthly Income (TMI) for both\ntimelines.\n\nIf financeable, what is the cost per month for each of the four dreams (rent, mortgage, payment plan\ninstallments, etc.)? Start thinking of income and expense in terms of monthly cash flow—dollars in and\ndollars out—instead of grand totals. Things often cost much, much less than expected. For example, a\nLamborghini Gallardo Spyder, fresh off the showroom floor at $260,000, can be had for $2,897.80 per\nmonth. I found my personal favorite, an Aston Martin DB9 with 1,000 miles on it, through eBay for\n\n$136,000—$2,003.10 per month. How about a Round-the-World trip (Los Angeles... Tokyo ...\n\nSingapore . . . Bangkok . . . Delhi or Bombay . . . London. . . Frankfurt . . . Los Angeles) for $1,399?\nFor some of these costs, the Tools and Tricks at the end of Chapter 14 will help.\n\nLast, calculate your Target Monthly Income (TMI) for realizing these dreamlines. This is how to do it:\nFirst, total each of the columns A, B, and C, counting only the four selected dreams. Some of these\ncolumn totals could be zero, which is fine. Next, add your total monthly expenses x 1.3 (the 1.3\nrepresents your expenses plus a 30% buffer for safety or savings). This grand total is your TMI and the\ntarget to keep in mind for the rest of the book. I like to further divide this TMI by 30 to get my TDI—\nTarget Daily Income. I find it easier to work with a daily goal. Online calculators on our companion site\ndo all the work for you and make this step a cinch.\n\nChances are that the figure is lower than expected, and it often decreases over time as you trade more\nand more “having” for once-in-a-lifetime “doing.” Mobility encourages this trend. Even if the total is\nintimidating, don’t fret in the least. I have helped students get to more than $10,000 per month in extra\nincome within three months.\n\nSample Dreamline\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_013835\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

Scores of children were killed. It was the first time a\nmajor outside event had intruded into the Trump presidency.\n\nMost presidencies are shaped by external crises. The presidency, in its most critical\nrole, is a reactive job. Much of the alarm about Donald Trump came from the widespread\nconviction that he could not be counted on to be cool or deliberate in the face of a storm.\nHe had been lucky so far: ten weeks in, and he had not been seriously tested. In part this\nmight have been because the crises generated from inside the White House had\novershadowed all outside contenders.\n\nEven a gruesome attack, even one on children in an already long war, might not yet be\na presidential game changer of the kind that everyone knew would surely come. Still,\nthese were chemical weapons launched by a repeat offender, Bashar al-Assad. In any other\npresidency, such an atrocity would command a considered and, ideally, skillful response.\nObama’s consideration had in fact been less than skillful in proclaiming the use of\nchemical weapons as a red line—and then allowing it to be crossed.\n\nAlmost nobody in the Trump administration was willing to predict how the president\nmight react—or even whether he would react. Did he think the chemical attack important\nor unimportant? No one could say.\n\nIf the Trump White House was as unsettling as any in American history, the president’s\nviews of foreign policy and the world at large were among its most random, uninformed,\nand seemingly capricious aspects. His advisers didn’t know whether he was an isolationist\nor a militarist, or whether he could distinguish between the two. He was enamored with\ngenerals and determined that people with military command experience take the lead in\nforeign policy, but he hated to be told what to do. He was against nation building, but he\nbelieved there were few situations that he couldn’t personally make better. He had little to\nno experience in foreign policy, but he had no respect for the experts, either.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_020021\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

As another example, if we\nsimilarly partition the decimal number 729 = 512 (2°) + 128 (2”) + 64 (2°) + 16 (2°) +\n8 (2°) + 1(2°), we find that its binary transformation results in 729 = 1011011001,\nthe 0’s representing the descending powers of two that are absent in the powers of\ntwo partition.

Trump in Atlantic City in 1990, seeking approval for his Trump Taj Mahal casino. Credit Associated Press\nDonald J. Trump proudly acknowledges he did not pay a dime in federal income taxes for years on end. He\ninsists he merely exploited tax loopholes legally available to any billionaire — loopholes he says Hillary\nClinton failed to close during her years in the United States Senate. “Why didn’t she ever try to change\nthose laws so I couldn’t use them?” Mr. Trump asked during a campaign rally last month.\nBut newly obtained documents show that in the early 1990s, as he scrambled to stave off financial ruin,\nMr. Trump avoided reporting hundreds of millions of dollars in taxable income by using a tax avoidance\nmaneuver so legally dubious his own lawyers advised him that the Internal Revenue Service would most\nlikely declare it improper if he were audited.\nThanks to this one maneuver, which was later outlawed by Congress, Mr. Trump potentially escaped\npaying tens of millions of dollars in federal personal income taxes. It is impossible to know for sure\nbecause Mr. Trump has declined to release his tax returns, or even a summary of his returns, breaking a\npractice followed by every Republican and Democratic presidential candidate for more than four decades.\nTax experts who reviewed the newly obtained documents for The New York Times said Mr. Trump’s tax\navoidance maneuver, conjured from ambiguous provisions of highly technical tax court rulings, clearly\npushed the edge of the envelope of what tax laws permitted at the time. “Whatever loophole existed was\nnot ‘exploited’ here, but stretched beyond any recognition,” said Steven M. Rosenthal, a senior fellow at\nthe nonpartisan Tax Policy Center who helped draft tax legislation in the early 1990s.\nGraphic\nMr. Trump managed to save millions in\npersonal taxes by borrowing – then losing\n– other people’s money.\nMoreover, the tax experts said the maneuver trampled a core tenet of\nAmerican tax policy by conferring enormous tax benefits on Mr. Trump\nfor losing vast amounts of other people’s money — in this case, money\ninvestors and banks\nhad entrusted to him to build a casino empire in\nAtlantic City.\nContinue reading the main story\nOPEN Graphic\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

(Steve Mnuchin, then the campaign’s\nfinance chairman, came to collect the loan with the wire instructions ready to go, so\nTrump couldn’t conveniently forget to send the money.)\n\nThere was in fact no real campaign because there was no real organization, or at best\nonly a uniquely dysfunctional one.

Lewandowski and Hope Hicks, the PR aide put on the campaign by\nIvanka Trump, had an affair that ended in a public fight on the street—an incident cited by\nNunberg in his response to Trump’s suit.

I've spoken to BDSMers who feel that the S&M community\npushes back far too hard, and that survivors are being aggressively silenced simply\nbecause the rest of us are so invested in fighting mainstream stereotypes. I have\nnever personally experienced this, but I would not be surprised if I did. And the fact is\nthat I'm sure there are toxic dynamics in some BDSM communities -- we aren't a\nmonolith, folks -- and that even in 100% awesome communities, I'm sure there are at\nleast a few abusive relationships. And even one abusive relationship in the community\nis obviously too many.\n\nAs Thomas MacAulay Millar wrote when the most recent abusive BDSM case hit the\nmedia, \"Our declaration that the abusers are not us has to be substantive.\" This is\nsomething we should be taking action on. But how?\n\nte ok ok\n\nDynamics Within the Community\n\nI have personally had excellent experiences within the S&M community. However, I am\nalso pretty thick-skinned (unfortunately, this is partly due to lots of time spent working in\na sexist industry); and I have a well-developed sense of my own boundaries. I am saying\nthis not to sound self-congratulatory but because I believe that, due to being thick-\nskinned, I may be less bothered by actual harassment and pressuring dynamics than\nothers are. Also, I am lucky enough that I've never experienced an assault. Therefore, it's\nincumbent upon me to listen to how other S&Mers -- especially female or genderqueer\nS&Mers -- feel about their experiences being pressured within the community.\n\nThere are issues that even I have noticed. For example, I think that there is a distasteful\ntendency to talk about \"real BDSM\" or \"serious BDSM,” as if some S&M is more\nlegitimate than other S&M. That's wrong and dangerous because it can make some\npeople feel as though they have to push past their boundaries -- do things they aren't\ncomfortable with -- in order to be accepted, liked, or seen as \"real.\" On the rare occasions\nthat I encounter this, I try to point out the problems right there and then. There is no such\nthing as \"more real\" and \"less real\" S&M. The only truly important part about any\nS&M activity is that it happen among enthusiastic, consenting adults.\n\nThomas once wrote to me by email that \"I tend to think that the dynamics of abuse in the\ncommunity are a combination of the desire to avoid washing our laundry in public,\npatriarchy colonizing our own, and the usual thing in small communities where people's\nwillingness to do the right thing in theory bumps up against their personal friends and\nloyalties.” I completely agree. I'd add that similar issues arise in almost all small\ncommunities, and it's not fair to blame S&M in itself for these problems. At the same\ntime, though, it's incumbent upon all BDSMers to contribute to an environment\nwhere people who don't want to participate can easily say \"no\", and can rely on\nbeing supported by others when they do.\n\nte ok ok\n\nExisting Anti-Abuse Initiatives in the BDSM Community\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_018555\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

Wiener recognized the\nrole of feedback in machine learning, but he missed the key role of representation. It’s\nnot possible to store all possible images in a self-driving car, or all possible sounds in a\nconversational computer; they have to be able to generalize from experience. The “deep”\npart of deep learning refers not to the (hoped-for) depth of insight but to the depth of the\nmathematical network layers used to make predictions. It turned out that a linear increase\nin network complexity led to an exponential increase in the expressive power of the\nnetwork.\n\nIf you lose your keys in a room, you can search for them. If you’re not sure\nwhich room they’re in, you have to search all the rooms in a building. If you’re not sure\nwhich building they’re in, you have to search all the rooms in all the buildings in a city.\nIf you’re not sure which city they’re in, you have to search all the rooms in all the\nbuildings in all the cities. In AI, finding the keys corresponds to things like a car safely\nfollowing the road, or a computer correctly interpreting a spoken command, and the\nrooms and buildings and cities correspond to all of the options that have to be considered.\nThis is called the curse of dimensionality.\n\nThe solution to the curse of dimensionality came in using information about the\nproblem to constrain the search. The search algorithms themselves are not new. But\nwhen applied to a deep-learning network, they adaptively build up representations of\nwhere to search. The price of this is that it’s no longer possible to exactly solve for the\nbest answer to a problem, but typically all that’s needed is an answer that’s good enough.\n\nTaken together, it shouldn’t be surprising that these scaling laws have allowed\nmachines to become effectively as capable as the corresponding stages of biological\ncomplexity. Neural networks started out with a goal of modeling how the brain works.\nThat goal was abandoned as they evolved into mathematical abstractions unrelated to\nhow neurons actually function. But now there’s a kind of convergence that can be\nthought of as forward- rather than reverse-engineering biology, as the results of deep\nlearning echo brain layers and regions.\n\nOne of the most difficult research projects P ve managed paired what we’d now\ncall data scientists with AI pioneers. It was a miserable experience in moving goalposts.\nAs the former progressed in solving long-standing problems posed by the latter, this was\ndeemed to not count because it wasn’t accompanied by corresponding leaps in\nunderstanding the solutions. What’s the value of a chess-playing computer if you can’t\nexplain how it plays chess?\n\nThe answer of course is that it can play chess. There is interesting emerging\nresearch that is applying AI to AI—that is, training networks to explain how they operate.\nBut both brains and computer chips are hard to understand by watching their inner\nworkings; they’re easily interpreted only by observing their external interfaces. We come\nto trust (or not) brains and computer chips alike based on experience that tests them\nrather than on explanations for how they work.\n\nMany branches of engineering are making a transition from what’s called\nimperative to declarative or generative design. This means that instead of explicitly\ndesigning a system with tools like CAD files, circuit schematics, and computer code, you\ndescribe what you want the system to do and then an automated search is done for\ndesigns that satisfy your goals and restrictions.

The rebuilding of Indonesia. Or New Orleans. Or both. Go there. I've just been. \nYou will never think the same way about anything again.\" \nSo spoke not Bill or Melinda Gates, but Ghislaine Maxwell, the 48-year-old woman being written up \neverywhere at the moment as the alleged \"procurer\" of young women for billionaire Jeffrey Epstein. \nEpstein, 57, is the financier who spent a year in jail on charges of soliciting prostitutes—and now there is talk of \nanother investigation because various women, now in their twenties and thirties, have come forward with \nallegations that he molested them when they were under-age. The allegations first surfaced in British \nnewspapers, which have zeroed in on Epstein's friendship with Prince Andrew, who has recently tried to \npublicly disassociate himself from his old pal. \nI wrote a piece for Vanity Fair in 2003 called \"The Talented Mr. Epstein.\" It was largely a business piece that \nfocused on his mysterious exit from Bear Stearns in 1981, his close relationships with Jimmy Cayne, Les \nWexner, the chairman of Limited Brands, and above all, the man who claimed to be his mentor, Steven Jude \nHoffenberg, who is currently serving a 20-year-jail sentence for bilking investors in Towers Financial out of \n$450 million. \nThe piece alluded to Epstein's great friendship with Maxwell, and how she introduced him to young women \nwith whom he had sexual relationships. But, in the end, the story didn't really go there, focusing instead on the \nissue that remains a mystery—how Jeffrey made his money, and how Ghislaine made hers. \nThis is not to say I didn't hear stories about the girls. I did. But, not knowing quite who to believe, I \nconcentrated on the intriguing financial mystery instead. But now the women have come back. Not the same \nones, different ones. And their stories are bone-chilling. Journalists from England have phoned—and, in one \ncase, flown—to ask me about Epstein and Maxwell. Who is he? And the British, especially, want to know: Who \nis she? At this point, I am so bored of repeating myself to others—it was, after all, my 2003 Vanity Fairstory \nthat really brought him into the limelight—that I have decided to write about this myself. \nBizarrely, perhaps, I have gotten to know Jeffrey and Ghislaine far better after my piece than before it. I kept \nrunning into both of them, separately, at parties. Jeffrey is not a social animal so he usually has a couple of \nyoung women with him who stand two feet behind him, as if serving a monarch. \"Do they speak?\" I remember \n1 \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 022234 \nasking him once, nodding at his lookalike blondes. He laughed. \"Not like you,Vicky,\" was his riposte. \nI remembered that when we'd once discussed math—in particular, an isosceles triangle—and I revealed I hadn't \nstudied math since I was 14 (such is, or was, the way of the British educational system), I received a package at \nhome via messenger. It was a book: \"Math for idiots.\" \nSo he is not without humor, even though he doesn't drink or smoke, and hates restaurants. \n\"Jeffrey knows a good deal about most subjects,\" newspaper publisher Mort Zuckerman told me last week. He \nwas certainly preaching to the converted. The truth is, Epstein does know a lot about a lot of things. Just a few \nmoments in his company and you know this to be true. \nWhen I saw pictures of Prince Andrew walking in Central Park with Jeffrey, my immediate thought was that \n\"Andy\"—as Jeffrey calls him—is probably asking for help with his role as British trade envoy, or whatever his \nstrange title is. Because if one thing's for sure: When it comes to international business, Jeffrey knows what \nhe's talking about far more than \"Andy\" does. Which is why Leon Black, Mort Zuckerman and a few other \nfinanciers hang out with him. \nAnd Ghislaine? \nFull disclosure: I like her. Most people in New York do. It's almost impossible not to. \nShe is always the most interesting, the most vivacious, the most unusual person in any room. I've spent hours \ntalking to her about the third world at a bar until 2am. She is as passionate as she is knowledgeable. She is \ncurious. She has spent weeks at the bottom of the ocean, literally going deeper than anyone else. She has sent \nme a DVD of the fish there. Her rolodex would blow away almost anyone else's I can think of—probably even \nRupert Murdochs'. She is very well-read and can talk about most things for hours. She is passionate about Bill \nClinton with whom she is close friends. \nYet, touchingly, when she had to give a speech at the 40th birthday party of her best friend, Ariadne Calvo-\nPlatero, (known fondly to her close friends as \"the Tennis Goddess\") Ghislaine shook a little with nerves. When \nit comes down to things she really cares about—and Ariadne is one of them—Ghislaine shows her vulnerability. \nAnd that vulnerability is key to understanding her friendship with Jeffrey. \n\"He saved her,\" I remember a close friend of mine telling me. \"When her father died, she was a wreck; \ninconsolable. And then Jeffrey took her in. She's never forgotten that—and never will.\" \nIn many ways, the socially awkward Epstein with his big house, plane, island and ranch was the perfect \nreplacement for her father, the late Robert Maxwell, newspaper tycoon and criminal. Sure, Jeffrey had his \nsexual pecadillos, but then Ghislaine's father was not without his oddities. After all, it was he who died leaving \na massive \"black hole\" he'd fraudulently created. To Ghislaine, Jeffrey's habits may not have seemed that \nstrange. \nIn fact, she probably figured, rather like I have, after years of writing about he very rich, that most successful \npeople in the end either have some weird habit (the late Bruce Wasserstein had the weight issues, the girl \nissues, and moved countries to avoid paying tax), or they break the law (Sam Waksal, Martha Stewart.) You \ndon't tend to get to the top by being the world's most balanced human being. Even the folksy Warren Buffett \ndidn't quite manage a normal life—whatever that is. He had a second \"wife\" for many years whose existence he \nhas been open about. \nSo what to make of the current fuss over Ghislaine? I haven't spoken to her or to Jeffrey, but I suspect that her \nloyalty to friends like Bill Clinton will keep her in good stead, in the end, she'll be out and about as always. Look \nat Waksal and Stewart. No one sees them and thinks: criminal. Au contraire. In this city, money makes up for \nall sorts of blemishes. \n2 \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 022235 \n--\n*********************************************************** \nThe information contained in this communication is \nconfidential, may be attorney-client privileged, may \nconstitute inside information, and is intended only for \nthe use of the addressee.

If an appreciated asset is includible in the estate, it generally\nreceives a step-up in basis for income tax purposes equal to the fair market value at death. Accordingly, there\nwould be little or no capital gains tax for appreciated assets sold soon after death.\n\nProposals. President-elect Trump has proposed to repeal the estate tax. The House Republicans’ Tax Proposal\nalso proposes federal estate tax repeal. It would appear that such repeal would be temporary, unless the tax\nchanges proposed can be enacted on a revenue neutral basis.’ It is not clear whether the federal gift tax would\nalso be repealed. The federal gift tax may be viewed as serving two purposes. First, it serves to support the estate\ntax, because without it you could make unlimited gifts during your life and thereby avoid federal estate tax at\ndeath. From that perspective, repealing the estate tax would suggest that the gift tax would also be repealed.\nHowever, the gift tax also serves to support the federal income tax. Without a gift tax, income-producing property\ncould be given to family members or others in a lower tax bracket (or residing in a state without an income tax),\nand subsequently given back. From that perspective, repealing the estate tax would not suggest that the gift tax\nalso be repealed. Neither President-elect Trump’s proposal nor the House Republicans’ Tax Proposal includes a\nrepeal of the gift tax.\n\nAs noted, appreciated assets includible in the estate generally receive a step-up in basis. President-elect Trump\nhas proposed to change this, however specific details have not been offered. The proposal sets forth a $10 million\nexemption for gains at death. It is not clear whether this exemption is for each decedent, or if that is the combined\nexemption for a married couple. It is also not clear whether any gains above the exemption would be subject to\ncapital gains tax at death (in effect a deemed sale at fair market value), or only subsequently when the asset is\nactually sold. It is also uncertain whether any unused exemption could be transferred to a surviving spouse.\n\n2 In order to comply with the Reconciliation procedure, the repeal needs to “sunset,” resulting in reinstatement of the estate\ntax after approximately 10 years. Under the 2001 Tax Act, there was a temporary repeal of the estate tax (and other taxes)\nfor this reason. Reconciliation rules will likely also add pressure to produce a revenue-neutral tax bill in order to avoid such a\n“sunset.” That could cause Congress to abandon repealing the estate tax.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_014520\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

This is, therefore, a discussion of common\nprinciples in Israeli foreign policy over nearly 3,000 years.\n\nFor convenience, we will use the term \"Israel\" to connote all of the\nHebrew and Jewish entities that have existed in the Levant since the\ninvasion of the region as chronicled in the Book of Joshua. As\nalways, geopolitics requires a consideration of three dimensions: the\ninternal geopolitics of Israel, the interaction of Israel and the\nimmediate neighbors who share borders with it, and Israel's\ninteraction with what we will call great powers, beyond Israel's\nborderlands.\n\nIsrael has manifested itself three times in history.

Under his artistic direction, the Silk Road Project\npresents performances by the acclaimed Silk Road Ensemble,\nengages in cross-cultural exchanges and residencies, leads\nworkshops for students, and partners with leading cultural\ninstitutions to create educational materials and programs.\n\nThe Project’s ongoing affiliation with Harvard\nUniversity has made it possible to broaden and enhance\neducational programming. In the 2011-2012 school year,\nwith ongoing partnerships with arts and educational\norganizations in New York City, it continues to expand Silk\nRoad Connect, a multidisciplinary educational initiative\nfor middle-school students in the city’s public schools.\nDeveloping new music is also a central undertaking of the\nSilk Road Project, which has been involved in commissioning\nand performing more than 60 new musical and multimedia\nworks from composers and arrangers around the world.\n\nAs the Chicago Symphony Orchestra’s Judson\nand Joyce Green Creative Consultant, Mr. Ma is partnering\nwith Maestro Riccardo Muti to provide collaborative\nmusical leadership and guidance on innovative program\ndevelopment for The Institute for Learning, Access and\nTraining at the Chicago Symphony Orchestra, and for Chicago\nSymphony artistic initiatives. Mr. Ma’s work focuses on the\ntransformative power music can have in individuals’ lives,\nand on increasing the number and variety of opportunities\naudiences have to experience music in their communities.\n\nMr. Ma and the Institute have created the Citizen Musician\nInitiative, a movement that calls on all musicians, music\nlovers, music teachers and institutions to use the art form\nto bridge gulfs between people and to create and inspire a\nsense of community. www.citizenmusician.org features\nstories of Citizen Musician activity across the globe.\n\nMr. Ma is also widely recognized for his strong\ncommitment to educational programs that bring the world\ninto the classroom and the classroom into the world.\n\nWhile touring, he takes time whenever possible to conduct\nmaster classes as well as more informal programs for\nstudents—musicians and non-musicians alike. He has also\nreached young audiences through appearances on “Arthur,”\n“Mister Rogers’ Neighborhood” and “Sesame Street.”\n\nMr. Ma’s discography of over 75 albums (including\nmore than 15 Grammy Award winners) reflects his wide-\nranging interests. He has made several successful recordings\nthat defy categorization, among them “Hush” with Bobby\nMcFerrin, “Appalachia Waltz” and “Appalachian Journey”\nwith Mark O’Connor and Edgar Meyer and two Grammy-\nwinning tributes to the music of Brazil, “Obrigado Brazil”\nand “Obrigado Brazil—Live in Concert.” Mr. Ma’s recent\nrecordings include Mendelssohn Trios with Emanuel Ax and\nItzhak Perlman. His new album, “The Goat Rodeo Sessions,”\nwith Edgar Meyer, Chris Thile and Stuart Duncan was\nreleased in October 2011. Across this full range of releases,\nMr. Ma remains one of the best-selling recording artists in the\nclassical field. All of his recent albums have quickly entered\nthe Billboard chart of classical best sellers, remaining in\nthe Top 15 for extended periods, often with as many as four\ntitles simultaneously on the list. In fall 2009, Sony Classical\nreleased a box set of over 90 albums to commemorate Mr.\nMa’s 30 years as a Sony recording artist.\n\nYo-Yo Ma was born in 1955 to Chinese parents living\nin Paris. He began to study the cello with his father at age\nfour and soon came with his family to New York, where he\nspent most of his formative years. Later, his principal teacher\nwas Leonard Rose at The Juilliard School. He has received\nnumerous awards, including the Avery Fisher Prize (1978),\n\nthe Glenn Gould Prize (1999), the National Medal of the\nArts (2001), the Dan David Prize (2006), the Sonning Prize\n(2006), the World Economic Forum’s Crystal Award (2008)\nand the Presidential Medal of Freedom (2010).

Some of the nation’s top\nattorneys have represented Epstein and some of his victims.\n\nBut like many of the past lawsuits spawned by Epstein’s behavior, most of the\nremaining ones are expected to be settled. And even public court records don't\ntell the full story — because many documents have been sealed or are heavily\nredacted.\n\nFor example, a defamation lawsuit against one of Epstein’s close friends was\nscheduled to go to trial in U.S. District Court in New York this coming Monday.\nBut both sides agreed to a delay last week, often a signal that a settlement\ncould be in the works.\n\nThe suit was filed by Virginia Roberts Giuffre against British-born socialite and\nlongtime Epstein friend Ghislaine Maxwell. In a 2009 lawsuit that Epstein\nsettled for an undisclosed amount, Giuffre claimed she was 15 when Maxwell\nrecruited her from her $9-an-hour job in the locker room at Mar-a-Lago, where\nher father had a job as a maintenance worker. Giuffre claims in court records\nthat Maxwell introduced her to Epstein and that Epstein turned her into his\ninternational sex slave.\n\nMaxwell wasn’t sued as part of the lawsuit Giuffre filed against Epstein. But, in\ncourt papers filed by Giuffre, Maxwell was accused of grooming Giuffre to be\nEpstein’s sexual toy.\n\nMaxwell ignored the allegations until Giuffre raised them again in December\n2014 and Maxwell began publicly disputing Giuffe’s claims. Famed attorney\nDavid Boies then filed a defamation lawsuit on Giuffre’s behalf, claiming\nMaxwell “undertook a concerted and malicious campaign to discredit Giuffre.”\nIn media interviews, Maxwell called Giuffre’s claims “obvious lies,” Boies wrote.\n\nThe trial promised to provide scurrilous details about Giuffre’s widely publicized\ncontention in court records that Epstein not only used her but loaned her to his\nrich and powerful friends, including such notables as Prince Andrew and\nformer President Bill Clinton. Similar claims against nationally-known attorney\nAlan Dershowitz, who represents Epstein, were withdrawn when the Harvard\nlaw professor and Giuffre’s attorneys reached a confidential settlement in\ndueling defamation lawsuits they filed against each other over the allegations.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_022992\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

But it wasn’t at hand. It took three more months to complete the Paris Peace Accords, which collapsed in 1975 when North Vietnam overran Saigon.\n\nThis Vietnam history is a caution against premature optimism about diplomatic solutions to deeply embedded conflicts, such as the one in Afghanistan. But the fact remains, as is so often stated, that there is no military solution to such conflicts. The challenge is creating a dialogue among people who profoundly mistrust each other — and averting a pell-mell civil war.\n\nPresident Obama is embracing the logic of a political settlement for Afghanistan with his speech Wednesday night. With Osama bin Laden dead, Obama can claim that America’s core mission of combating al-Qaeda is succeeding. He can bring some troops home and step up diplomatic negotiations with the Taliban to reach a broad peace deal by 2014. \n\nObama’s strategy for the Afghanistan negotiations highlights two factors that could also be relevant in the increasingly messy conflicts in Libya and Syria. First, the dialogue must be sponsored by people inside the country that’s facing internal strife. The United States may encourage contacts, but the process has to be “Afghan-led,” or “Libyan-led,” or “Syrian-led.” Second, this dialogue requires a regional framework, so that the combatants don’t turn to meddling neighbors for help. \n\nAmerica’s secret contacts with the Taliban have made progress partly because President Hamid Karzai wants them to succeed and, perhaps more important, because India, Pakistan, Russia and China are also supporting the outreach process — with silent acquiescence from Iran, too. This regional framework is the real exit ramp that will allow withdrawal of U.S. troops. \n\nLet’s think about how this diplomatic model might apply to Libya and Syria. In both cases, the insurgents are seen in the West as the “good guys,” battling corrupt, autocratic leaders. Personally, I wish that both Moammar Gaddafi and Bashar al-Assad would give up power tomorrow. But that doesn’t seem in the cards: Both leaders have shown they’re willing to kill thousands of their citizens to hang on, and the rebel movements in both countries seem too weak to displace the dictators by force. Outside military intervention may seem tempting, but it isn’t working very well in Libya, and might fare even worse in Syria.\n\nThe right goal in Libya and Syria (as in Afghanistan) is a transition to an inclusive, democratic government — with as little bloodshed along the way as possible. The alternative to such a settlement is a protracted conflict that could mean massacres of civilians and, on present evidence, a bloody stalemate that further destabilizes the region. \n\nIt’s distasteful to contemplate dialogue with leaders such as Gaddafi and Assad who, to put it bluntly, have blood on their hands. But this approach is worth exploring if it can foster a transition to a democratic government — where the autocrats cede power to a coalition that includes reformist elements of the old regime and the opposition.\n\nAn emissary who is close to Gaddafi’s inner circle has outlined in recent interviews a Libyan formula for transition. He proposes a gradual transfer of power to a new government that would unite the rebel Transitional National Council with “reconcilables” from the regime. Gaddafi himself would quit Tripoli and give up power, but this would be an outcome of negotiations, rather than a precondition. State Department officials are skeptical, but they should test the emissary’s ability to deliver. \n\nThe Syrian case is also complicated by the blood-soaked history of the regime. In a speech Monday, Assad proposed a national dialogue, in which the democratic opposition would select 100 participants to meet with government representatives — and plan elections and a new constitution. Given Assad’s disappointing record, it’s doubtful that he can or will deliver. But it makes sense to test his offer — not least because such a process would terrify Assad’s patrons in Iran. If the dialogue fails, the Syrian demonstrations will be all the more potent, and Assad’s hold weaker. \n\nThese internal dialogues should be bolstered by regional support, as with Afghanistan. The right shepherds for Libya are its newly democratic neighbors, Egypt and Tunisia, backed by France, Britain and Germany. In Syria, the obvious mediator-in-waiting is Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan, backed by the Gulf countries. \n\nHere’s the point: The Arab Spring should not turn into a summer of blood, if there are diplomatic alternatives. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\fArticle 2.\n\nProject Syndicate\n\nThe Middle East’s Slow-Motion Revolution\n\nPrince El Hassan bin Talal\n\n\n\n2011-06-21 -- AMMAN – There seem to be a thousand and one interpretations of the changes sweeping across the countries of the Middle East and North Africa. One response that is often heard is a note of cautious optimism, captured in US President Barack Obama recent speech at the State Department when he referred to the “promise of the future.”\n\nBut sometimes we also hear the populist smears that have been applied to the Middle East for so long that nothing, it seems – no amount of extraordinary change – can silence them. After the successful revolts in Cairo and Tunis, the slanders abated. Soon, however, the old messages depicting the Middle East as extreme, fundamentalist, and hostile to democracy began to re-insinuate themselves in the West.\n\nOn the other hand, ordinary men and women in the West seem to feel an instinctive sympathy toward their counterparts in the Middle East and North Africa, many of whom are paying the ultimate price in fighting for their rights. These sacrifices have convinced many Westerners that the Middle East is not beyond redemption, and that the region’s people should be given a chance to enjoy the same liberty that they do.\n\nThis clash of perceptions has caught the world’s policy experts and analysts off guard. That, too, is not surprising, because the situation remains an amorphous mix of hope and destruction.\n\nBut today, in Amman, as in almost every Arab capital, independent meetings and debates about how to move forward are taking place in art galleries, think tanks, salons, ordinary households, and, most significantly, online. A region often depicted as “backward” is debating its destiny both face-to-face and across social networks every second of every day.\n\nYet tweeting is no substitute for thought. Indeed, the events and personalities that have so far gained attention seem to fill the void where the declarations of freedom and treatises on rights – where the ideas – should be.\n\nThe result is the confusion that we now see. Contradictions abound. Governments across the region have been identified as the problem, and yet the state is being called upon to address a social and political agenda that has not yet been fully defined. We are seeing the birth of a more democratic spirit among the region’s peoples, but a corresponding sense of democratic responsibility remains underdeveloped.\n\nNo matter how influential new media have been, they cannot replace the need for a region-wide “manifesto for change” that all who seek freedom can embrace. Any such manifesto must address the two elephants in the room – Palestine and the price of oil – as well as the extent to which regional water and energy resources, now rapidly depleting, should be shared. (Here, I and experts from around the world have been calling for the creation of a Supranational Commission for Water and Energy to ensure the kind of sustainable resource management that the Strategic Foresight Group has labeled “Blue Peace.”)\n\nOf course, generating ideas is easier said than done. By limiting free speech and forcing millions of young people to stay at home without jobs, the only public space left for many people happens to be virtual. Arab governments switched their people off, so their people migrated online. The result is that an old guard now confronts a new wave, and the two sides think entirely differently and speak at cross-purposes.\n\nWhatever the new wave’s limitations, its borderless online conversations are offsetting the region’s political, religious, social, and cultural balkanization. The people of West Asia and North Africa are talking among themselves, even if their governments remain remote. That is a source of hope, if not yet of the systematic and coherent ideas about how to remake their societies that the region needs.\n\nCyber-activism has its limits; it cannot, in the end, deliver either democracy or prosperity. Communication may be instant, but, with no coherent animating ideology, the revolution proceeds in slow motion. The battle being fought for the soul of the Middle East cannot be won online, nor can it be subdued through the cynical manipulation of trust and fear. The quality of freedom in the Middle East, as elsewhere, will depend on its supporters’ commitment to liberal and democratic values.\n\n\n\nHRH Prince El Hassan bin Talal is chairman and founder of the Arab Thought Forum and the West Asia-North Africa Forum.\n\n\n\fArticle 3.\n\nStratfor\n\nTurkey's Inevitable Problems With Neighbors\n\n\n\nJune 21, 2011 -- Syrian President Bashar al Assad delivered a long and uneventful speech Monday, during which he basically divided Syria's protest society into three categories: the good, the criminal and the Salafi. Assad claimed that instability caused by the latter two was to blame for the delay in implementing reforms. Rather than promising concrete reforms that have been strongly urged by the Turks, the Syrian president emphasized that security had to come first, while trying to present himself as a neutral mediator between the population and security forces. Not surprisingly, the speech fell on deaf ears throughout Syria, but also in Ankara, where the government let its growing impatience show and told the Syrian president once again that he isn't doing enough to satisfy the demands of his people.\n\nWith more than 10,000 Syrian refugees spilling across the Turkish border to escape the army's siege, the situation in Syria is undoubtedly growing desperate. However, we have not yet seen the red flags that would indicate the al Assad regime is in imminent danger of collapse. The reasons are fairly straightforward. The al Assad clan belongs to Syria's Alawite minority, who only 40 years ago were living under the thumb of the country's majority Sunni population. Four decades in power is not a long time, and vengeance is a powerful force in this part of the world. The Alawites understand that they face an existential crisis, and if they allow their grip over the Baath-dominated political system - and most importantly the military - to loosen even slightly, they will likely become the prime targets of a Sunni vendetta campaign aiming to return the Alawites to their subservient status. This may explain why al Assad felt the need to stress in his speech that his minority government would not take \"revenge\" against those who stand down from their protests.\n\nTurkey is understandably nervous about what is happening next door in Syria. Ankara would prefer a Syria ruled by a stable Sunni regime, especially one that would look to Turkey's ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) for political guidance. However, the Turks can see that Alawite leadership will not leave power without a long and bloody fight. Recreating a sphere of Turkish-modeled Sunni influence in the Levant may be a long-term goal for Ankara, but the Turkish government is certainly not prepared to pay the near-term cost of civil strife in Syria spilling across Turkish borders.\n\nTurkey has so far addressed this dilemma mainly through rhetoric, issuing angry speeches against Syrian leadership, while floating the idea of a military buffer zone for Syrian refugees. For awhile, assuming the role of regional disciplinarian played well to an AKP public-relations strategy that portrayed Turkey as the model for the Arab Spring and the go-to mediator for the Mideast's problems. But the more Syria destabilizes - and with each time it ignores Ankara's demands - the more Turkey risks appearing impotent.\n\nThe crisis in Syria will likely lead to a recalibration of Turkish foreign policy. The architect of Turkey's foreign policy, Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu, coined the phrase \"zero problems with neighbors\" to describe the guiding principle of Turkey's interactions with surrounding regimes. Turkey obviously has a problem with Syria's leadership, and not a small one. It is becoming increasingly apparent that Turkey may not yet have what it takes to deal with Syria, beyond issuing rhetorical censures. Establishing a military buffer zone as a safe haven for Syrian refugees not only would call for an international mandate, but would entail Turkish troops occupying foreign land - which would likely set off alarm bells among Arabs who already suspect Turkey of harboring a so-called neo-Ottoman agenda. Turkey's ardent support for Libyan rebels against Moammar Gadhafi and public backing for Syrian opposition forces have already unnerved Arab monarchist regimes that are trying to undermine the effects of the Arab Spring and are growing distrustful of Turkish intentions. Moreover, any move construed as Turkey trying to facilitate the downfall of the al Assad regime would undoubtedly create problems with Iran, a neighbor Turkey has taken great care to avoid aggravating. Iran relies heavily on the Alawite regime in Syria to maintain a foothold in the Levant through groups like Hezbollah in Lebanon and Palestinian Islamic Jihad and Hamas in the Gaza Strip. Since the return of Syria to Sunni control would unravel a key pillar of Iranian deterrent strategy, we can expect that Iran is doing everything possible to undermine the very Syrian opposition forces looking to Ankara for support. Turkey has avoided confrontation with Iran thus far while working quietly to build a Sunni counterbalance to Iranian-backed Shia in Iraq in the face of an impending U.S. withdrawal. A power vacuum in Syria filled by Turkish-backed Sunnis would reinforce a nascent confrontation between Iran and Turkey with deep geopolitical underpinnings.\n\nNations do not have friends; they have interests. And Turkey, an historically influential country sitting on one of the most geopolitically complex pieces of real estate in the world, is now finding that a foreign policy built on avoiding problems with neighbors grinds against reality. In STRATFOR's view, this was inevitable, which is why we took interest in Monday's issue of Today's Zaman, an English-language outlet loyal to the movement of Fethullah Gulen and strongly supportive of the ruling AKP. Two editorials in Monday's publication held that the Syrian crisis has exposed the coming demise of Turkey's \"zero problems with neighbors\" policy.\n\nThat this idea is being introduced into the public discourse is revealing, not only of Turkey's internal debate on this issue, but also of the message that Ankara may be trying to send to the United States and others: It needs time to develop the wherewithal to meaningfully influence its neighborhood. The United States wants Turkey to help shoulder the burden of managing the Middle East as it looks to extricate its military from Iraq. Washington especially needs to develop a strong counterbalance to Iran - a role historically filled by Turkey. This obviously presents a conflict of interests: Washington is trying to push Turkey into a role it's not quite ready for; meanwhile, Turkey is trying to sort out its growing pains while appearing influential abroad.\n\nTurkey's evolution will be difficult and uncomfortable, but this should not come as a surprise. \"Zero problems with neighbors\" worked well for Turkey at the start of the century, as it came out of its domestic shell, yet took care to avoid being seen as a resurgent power with imperial interests. After a decade of regional conflict, Turkey is finding that problems with neighbors are not only unavoidable, but may even be necessary as the Turkish state redefines its core interests.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\fArticle 4.\n\nAgence Global\n\nA Defiant Asad Sticks to His Guns\n\nPatrick Seale\n\n\n\n21 Jun 2011 -- All those dreaming of -- and working for -- ‘regime change’ in Syria will be outraged by President Bashar al-Asad’s speech last Monday, 20 June. They want him out, together with the hate figures around him who have been conducting the brutal repression of the protest movement. But he is not stepping down. He intends to stay on -- and to fight on. \nAsad gave no ground to his political enemies. The speech was not, in fact, addressed to them. It was addressed to Syria’s ‘silent majority’ which -- or so the President continues to believe -- aspires to security, stability and national unity, and is terrified, above all, of a sectarian war on the Iraqi model. \nThe President explained that, in order to understand the nature of the crisis, he had held several meetings in recent weeks with citizens from all parts of the country. He wanted to hear directly from them. The conclusion he had reached was that there were several different components to the protest movement.\nFirst, there were those who had legitimate demands, who wanted justice, democracy and jobs, and the resolution of problems which had accumulated over decades. Their demands could not be ignored. He intended to address them and had already started to do so. But then there were the others -- the criminal outlaws, the blasphemous intellectuals who spoke in the name of religion, the vandals, conspirators and paid agents of foreign powers. Under cover of the protest movement, they had taken up arms against the state!\nThese conspirators, he said, had called for foreign intervention, they had smeared Syria’s image and destroyed public and private property. They had no respect for state institutions or the rule of law. No reform was possible with such vandals.\nHe dismissed the argument that Syria was not facing a conspiracy. There was a conspiracy, he declared – designed abroad and perpetrated inside the country. How else to explain the satellite phones, the advanced weapons, the guns mounted on trucks in the hands of his enemies? Syria had always been a target of conspiracy. He had long been under pressure to abandon his principles. (No doubt, by this he meant his Arab nationalist convictions, his alliance with Iran and Hizbullah, his opposition to Israel and the United States.) Syria needed to strengthen its immunity against such conspiracies, he insisted.\nIn this defiant speech, President Asad made no mention of the abuses of his security services -- the callous use of live fire against civilians, the killing of well over a thousand protesters, the deployment of tanks to besiege rebellious cities, the mass arrests, the beatings and the torture, the flight of terrified refugees across Syria’s borders -- a catalogue of outrages which has shattered Syria’s reputation and earned it international condemnation. The refugees in Turkey should return home, he said. They would not be punished. The army would protect them. But those who have had a taste of army brutality may not be persuaded by the President’s assurances. He did, however, have a word of condolence for bereaved mothers.\nThe heart of Asad’s address was a statement of his ambition to shape a new vision for Syria’s future. Reform, he declared, was his firm conviction. His one big idea -- the centrepiece of his speech -- was a plan for a National Dialogue. A special authority had been set up to work out the necessary arrangements for this great debate, which he hoped would provide for the widest possible popular participation. The task was to create a forum where far-reaching political and economic reforms could be discussed, so that legislation could then be drafted and passed into law. There could be no giant leap into the unknown because decisions taken now would affect Syria for decades to come.\nThe speech will disappoint all those who had hoped for immediate and dramatic reforms. The President served up a diet of words rather than of actions. He did mention, however, that elections would take place in August, and that among the bills to be discussed would be a new electoral law, a law allowing for the formation of political parties, a media law, a law to give greater powers to municipal authorities, and the need to amend or even entirely rewrite the Constitution. He seemed to be indicating that the notorious Article 8 of the Constitution, which gives the Ba‘th party a “leading role in state and society,” might be scrapped.\nThis may well prove hard to achieve. Having enjoyed a monopoly on the political scene since 1963, Syria’s Ba‘th party has long since become rigid and Stalinist, and is probably incapable of sharing power with other parties. More battles lie ahead.\nTo all but his diehard political enemies, President Asad seemed thoughtful and even conciliatory. He did not look like a leader battling for survival. No doubt, the credits outweigh the debits in his personal profit-and-loss account. He knows that he need fear no foreign military intervention: After Libya, no Western power would even contemplate it. Some soldiers have defected to the rebels, but there has been no major split in the army or the security services, or in the regime itself. Whatever disputes and dissensions there may have been in the ruling circle have been carefully hidden from view. He knows that so long as they remain united, it will be difficult, if not impossible, for the opposition to topple him.\nAt the UN and elsewhere, Syria enjoys the protection of Russia -- perhaps concerned for its naval base at Tartus. The Russian view is that the Syrian crisis poses no threat to international peace and security. China, India, South Africa and Brazil all side with Syria. At home, the country will not face starvation -- this year’s wheat harvest is estimated at 3.6m tons. Oil and gas exports have so far not been affected.\nOn the debit side, however, tourism has collapsed; inward investment has dried up; the increase Asad has decree in the salaries of government bureaucrats is estimated to cost $1bn a year -- driving the government deficit to dangerous heights. If the crisis continues much longer, Syria will need a large cash injection from somewhere, and is probably looking to Qatar. Then there is the unpredictable factor. What if the protests continue and become more violent? Will the merchant middle class, the backbone of the regime, remain loyal? Could the economy take the strain? What might next Friday bring?\nI was reached this week on the phone by a well-placed Syrian, close to the regime. “Western condemnation of Syria is pure hypocrisy,” he fumed. “Every regime in the world will try to destroy its enemies. Have you heard of a place called Abu Ghraib? Or the hundreds of thousands killed by America in Iraq? Or Israel’s massacre in Gaza? Or the 10,000 Palestinians in Israeli jails? If the U.S. and Israel can get away with large-scale killing and torture, why can’t we? They claim to act in self-defence, so do we!”\nIt would seem that lawlessness and contempt for human life are contagious.\n\nPatrick Seale is a leading British writer on the Middle East.

Over the last decades, Egypt gradually lost its prestige and influence in the region as it became an introverted autocratic regime. In the post-Nasserite period, Egypt strengthened its ties with Israel, isolated Hamas, repressed domestic Islamic movements, marginalized democratic forces, and confronted regional powers such as Iran. However, with the political demise of Hosni Mubarak the country’s foreign policy is gradually moving in a direction that better reflects popular sentiments. The new Egypt is looking to normalize relations with countries like Iran, re-evaluate ties with Israel, and tilt more toward the Palestinian cause.   Given its profound cultural capital, powerful military, huge population, and strong economic fundamentals, Egypt could not only regain its regional influence but also play a more assertive and prominent international role. More importantly, the emergence of a democratic system in Egypt could transform the country into a model for the Arab world.\n\nDemocratic Earthquake\n\nDomestic factors like corruption, political repression, and desperate economic conditions galvanized the populace against the Egyptian state. But Mubarak’s foreign policy doctrine also contributed to the erosion of his political base. The democratic revolution was also a response to the government’s complicity in the siege of Gaza, seeming timidity in foreign affairs, and his growing reliance on the United States for the perpetuation of his reign.  The High Council of the Armed Forces currently rules Egypt, and the military shows no sign of making a decisive break with the past. Nevertheless, the new leaders are more wary and sensitive to the qualms of the people. The prosecution of former ministers, officials, and even the former president and his family symbolizes the junta’s responsiveness to popular demands. The military’s consistently expressed commitment to push through with democratic elections and create a conducive environment for an eventual transition to a civilian democratic political system indicates that the balance of forces has shifted to the people — despite the lingering threat of counterrevolution, mobilization fatigue, and medium-term disenchantment with democracy.   The military occupies a position of prestige and privilege in the society, and it is in its best interest to create a smooth transfer of power in succeeding months and years. Perpetuating the policies of the past regime would anger the population. So it's more than likely that the new Egyptian leadership will review the tenets of the former regime’s foreign policy architecture.   The Islamists are already pre-empting their opponents by talking about how they seek to emulate the Turkish model, where Islam and political moderation coincide, especially in the realm of foreign affairs. Moreover, the Muslim Brotherhood has expressed its interest in occupying more low profile and welfare-oriented executive ministries. So far, the Islamists have not even vied for the position of presidency, content with gaining some parliamentary representation and possibly some influence in the executive branch.   The Islamists at this point are more concerned with gaining domestic political support and avoiding any backlash from the military, democrats, and foreign powers. Any Islamist-backed radical departure from the past could justify a crackdown by the military or compromise the country's economic well-being and political stability, which could, in turn, erode broader popular support for their agenda. However, if Israel steps up its aggressive policies in the region — with the West failing to support the democrats — the Islamists could try to pressure the government — through mass rallies, political mobilization, and populist rhetoric — to abrogate the peace treaty with Israel or to qualitatively shift, if not downgrade, bilateral relations with the United States. Such a dynamic would inadvertently put pressure on post-revolutionary Egypt to be more assertive in its ties with Israel and the West.\n\nThe Gushing Wound of Palestine\n\nThe Palestinian question has been at the heart of the Arab political discourse for the last seven decades. The 1979 peace deal between Egypt and Israel ushered in an unprecedented phase of strong bilateral cooperation between the two former enemies, but it was also a major cause of the unpopularity of both Sadat and Mubarak. Israel benefited from the cold peace by neutralizing the most powerful conventional force in the Arab world. It even coordinated closely with Egypt on the siege of Gaza.Although the peace accords allowed Egypt to avoid another conflict with Israel and win substantial economic-military aid from the United States, the country’s image has suffered a significant blow in the last three decades. Strategically, Egypt’s withdrawal from the Arab-Israeli conflict allowed other powers to raise their political profile and regional influence. The resulting strategic vacuum simply shifted the regional balance of power in favor of non-Arab and/or non-traditional powers. Iran, Syria, and Qatar — and later Turkey — have been the biggest beneficiaries of Egypt’s neutrality on the Palestinian issue.\n\nAware of the popular sentiment in favor of the Palestinian cause, the new Egyptian leadership initiated two important policy shifts. First, it re-opened the Rafah border, which has allowed most residents of Gaza to escape the suffocating siege imposed by Israel. Second, Egypt has played an active role in facilitating the unity deal between rival factions in Palestine. The deal represents the best chance for Palestinians to finally form a united front in future negotiations with Israel and break the oppressive deadlock that has plagued previous negotiations. These two developments may portend more critical foreign policy reformulations, especially on Israeli-Egyptian relations, in coming years.\n\nReaching out to Others\n\nAnxieties over political change in Egypt are not only confined to the Palestine-Israel equation. Egypt’s emerging détente with Iran is beginning to worry not only the United States and Israel, but also monarchies in the Persian Gulf.  A year before the 2011 revolution, many prominent leaders in Egypt and the Arab world began to realize the value of normalized relations with Iran. The two countries began to consider the resumption of direct flights between the two nations after 32 years. Also in 2010, the head of the Arab League, Amr Moussa, urged member countries to acknowledge the new geopolitical realities in the region: namely, the rise of non-Arab countries such as Turkey and Iran. He touched on the thorny issue of Iran-Arab tensions by stating, “I realize that some are worried about Iran but that is precisely why we need the dialogue.” He reiterated his  position after the revolution as he was preparing to run for the presidency in the Egyptian elections:“Iran is not the natural enemy of Arabs… We have a lot to gain by peaceful relations -- or less tense relations -- with Iran.”   Just weeks after the downfall of Mubarak, Egypt allowed Iranian warships to cross the Suez Canal, provoking uproar among Israelis and even Americans. In succeeding months, the diplomatic flirtation between the two countries took an even more interesting turn when Egyptian Foreign Minister Nabil El-Arabi stated that Egypt was \"turning over a new leaf with all countries, including Iran.\" Iran’s Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Salehi immediately expressed his countrys appreciation of El-Arabi’s comments by expressing his wishes for “expansion in relations.” The two ministers met on the sidelines of the Organization of Islamic Conference (OIC) in Bali, where the OIC expressed its support for improvement of ties between the two major Muslim countries.\n\nEgypt’s Changing Role\n\nGamal Abdel Nasser was the central figure behind the first Arab revolution, which precipitated the withdrawal of colonial powers, Britain and France, from the Middle East. As Saudi Arabia spearheads a regional counter-revolution by abetting repressive monarchs in the Persian Gulf and providing sanctuary to fallen autocrats — with President Saleh of Yemen being among the latest beneficiaries — post-revolutionary Egypt could once again inspire change across the region. Given its size, history, and cultural influence, a successful transition to democracy would undoubtedly transform Egypt into a role model for smaller fellow Arab countries.\n\nThe era of yes men in the Arab world is beginning to end, and the new Egypt — though it has maintained good ties with the U.S. — will be more assertive and independent in its foreign policy choices. The case of Turkey is very instructive. Despite being a pillar of NATO, and a strong ally of the Unites States, Turkey has repeatedly shown its independence on a number of key regional issues such as Iran's nuclear program, the invasion of Iraq, and the siege of Gaza.\n\nThere are limits to this independence. Egypt is heavily reliant on aid, investments, tourism, and trade. Economic concerns are still the country’s top priority. According to the latest Gallup poll, the majority of Egyptians are extremely pessimistic about the economy. Therefore, the priority of post-revolutionary Egypt’s leaders is ultimately the restoration of confidence and economic dynamism.\n\nDemocrats and Islamists are also aware that the military could choose to intervene — with tacit support from outside — if the democratic process gives birth to a radical government that jeopardizes the interests of the military and the state. This has been the case in other comparable countries such as Turkey and Pakistan, where the military has also played a central role in determining the destiny of the nation-state. Egypt is still the top U.S. recipient of military assistance after Israel. It is simply too embedded in the U.S. military-industrial complex to risk alienating Washington. So, too, has the financial clout and political weight of the Gulf Cooperation Council made a precipitous Egyptian tilt toward Iran unlikely.   Already, the Saudis are reportedly trying to sabotage the emerging rapprochement between the two countries. According to the head of Iran's Interest Section in Cairo Mojtaba Amani, “Saudi Arabia has even threatened to expel 1.5 million workers to dissuade Cairo from the resumption of ties with Tehran.”  Given these undeniable realities, an abrogation of the Israeli-Egyptian 1979 peace accords or the formation of an axis between Iran and Egypt is not in the offing. Moreover, the Egyptian foreign minister has injected realism into the rapprochement euphoria by indicating that Iran should not expect any substantial improvement in bilateral ties unless a new government is elected. In fact, just recently, Egypt expelled an Iranian on grounds of espionage, denting efforts by both states to improve relations.  Nonetheless, Egyptians from across the political spectrum seem to support normalizing ties. A delegation composed of Egyptian academics and civil society leaders recently visited Iran. According to a member of the delegate, Mustafa Nagar, “Iranians believe Egypt is a strong country, not only to put Israel under pressure, but to benefit from the Egyptians themselves, that’s why Egypt must restore ties with this great civilization.”\n\nThe Post-Hegemonic Era\n\nThe United States should play a constructive role in the democratic transition of Egypt. Despite anxieties over the possible shift in Cairo’s foreign policy doctrine, Washington should ensure that the development of civil democratic institutions is not, again, compromised in the name of stability. The last thing Washington needs is the emergence of a Pakistan-like political system, where the military controls the state at the expense of economic development, democratization, and political stability. The collapse of Arab autocracies and the impending conflagration in Pakistan should serve as wake-up calls for policymakers in Washington.\n\nInstead of indiscriminately throwing its weight around and unconditionally cultivating ties with intransigent allies such as Israel and Saudi Arabia, the United States should be looking toward further cooperation with powerful and democratizing countries such as Turkey and Egypt. Maintenance and deepening of close ties with legitimate states with civilian governments committed to democracy and economic development is the best way for the United States to create islands of peace in different regions and construct durable multilateral arrangements, which serve common interests.\n\nSuch strategic patience could also rehabilitate the battered U.S. image around the globe. For instance, Brazil’s case is very instructive: the rise of a democratic and progressive government, under President Luiz Ignacio Lula da Silva, ushered in a new era of stability and economic progress. Today, Brazil is sharing the responsibilities of hemispheric leadership with the United States and contributing to regional stability and integration. The lesson is simple: reliance on responsible regional powers is America’s best chance for a smooth transition to a truly multipolar global system. Egypt can and should be just such a partner. \n\n\n\nForeign Policy In Focus contributor Richard Javad Heydarian is a foreign affairs analyst based in Manila.\n\fArticle 6.\n\nForeign Affairs\n\nHow Fatah-Hamas Unity Threatens U.S. Funding\n\nDouglas N. Greenburg and Derek D. Smith\n\n\nJune 20, 2011 -- The reconciliation agreement signed in April between Fatah and Hamas, which called for the creation of an interim Palestinian unity government followed by elections later this year, raises a number of difficult issues for the United States. Among these is whether Washington can lawfully continue to provide aid to the Palestinian Authority (PA) if it includes Hamas as an equal partner. After all, existing U.S. law designates Hamas as a terrorist organization and thus prevents the United States from aiding it in any way. Although the unity pact suffered a setback when a planned conference in Cairo on Tuesday to announce a new government was postponed, negotations are ongoing. Should the two sides eventually succeed in creating a unity government, continued U.S. funding for the PA could be illegal. Despite this, given the PA’s dependence on U.S. aid, Washington may decide that financially sustaining the Palestinian leadership is vital to the peace process or other strategic interests. As a result, it may attempt to continue aiding elements of the PA that remain unaffiliated with Hamas. Yet absent specific congressional authorization, such a strategy will face significant legal obstacles.\n\nU.S. law has long prohibited citizens from providing support to or doing business with Hamas, which has been on the Treasury Department’s designated terrorist list since 1995 and the State Department’s list of designated Foreign Terrorist Organizations since 1997. Under the U.S. criminal code, individuals cannot knowingly provide an FTO with “material support or resources,” which is broadly defined as any “property or service,” including money, training and advice, safe haven, transportation, and weapons, among other forms of assistance. Violation of this statute is punishable by up to 15 years in prison, or life in prison if the support results in the death of any person. \n\nThe Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) also enforces sanctions against Hamas and its affiliates, forbidding U.S. persons from engaging in any transactions with a designated terrorist, and further requiring that U.S. financial institutions block any transactions involving assets of FTOs. OFAC frequently imposes civil fines against violators of these sanctions, who may also suffer criminal penalties. \n\nThe U.S. government has enforced these laws by bringing several high-profile criminal prosecutions against various individuals and charitable organizations for raising funds for Hamas. In 2008, for example, a federal jury in Texas convicted five U.S. citizens on charges of providing material support to Hamas through their ostensibly charitable organization, the Holy Land Foundation, resulting in sentences of 15 to 65 years in prison. The Treasury Department has also targeted charities acting as fundraising fronts for Hamas, such as the Al-Aqsa Foundation, an international relief organization formerly based in Germany that Treasury designated a terrorist entity in 2003, aiming to put them out of business by freezing their bank accounts. \n\nCurrent U.S. law, then, clearly forbids and severely punishes a wide range of assistance to Hamas. But what if Hamas takes a leading role in another organization not designated as an FTO -- specifically, the PA? This question arose in 2006, when Hamas members defeated Fatah in that year’s Palestinian elections. Hamas’ presence in the PA posed a significant challenge to U.S. interests in the Palestinian territories. Even so, the PA remained highly dependent on U.S. aid, receiving more than $400 million per year from Washington, and it was unclear whether the PA and its president, Fatah leader Mahmoud Abbas, could survive without it. \n\nAs a result, the U.S. Congress responded to Hamas’ 2006 electoral victory by passing the Palestinian Anti-Terrorism Act (PATA), which conditioned assistance to the PA on a presidential certification that Hamas did not effectively control any “ministry, agency, or instrumentality” of the PA and made “demonstrable progress” toward five benchmarks related to transparency, democratization, and antiterrorism. PATA provided a national security waiver that allowed the White House to continue funding various entities in the PA presidential office and judiciary branch, so long as Hamas did not control the recipient. It also permitted funding to nongovernmental organizations that provide aid to the West Bank and Gaza relating to humanitarian needs and democracy promotion. \n\nUltimately, the dilemma over funding the PA resolved itself in 2007, when Hamas broke with Fatah and the PA and took control of Gaza. This separation freed OFAC to allow all transactions with the Fatah-controlled PA in the West Bank. But should Hamas rejoin the PA as a result of the recent unity arrangement, there may be pressure on OFAC to take a tougher stance. Indeed, in recent appropriations bills, Congress has made assistance to a “power-sharing government” in Palestine contingent on compliance with PATA. \n\nCongressional authorization to fund a Hamas-affiliated PA would likely overcome existing legal prohibitions. In the face of PATA, however, there is a substantial risk that providing aid without specific congressional authority would violate U.S. criminal laws. Although there are several arguments for exempting the PA from the U.S. laws against dealing with FTOs, none is particularly convincing. To begin with, it could be argued that although U.S. law prohibits individuals from assisting Hamas, the president’s constitutional powers to conduct foreign affairs might exempt officials carrying out the government’s international policy from criminal prosecution. The existing laws and regulations, however, make federal officials just as liable for providing aid to FTOs as any private citizen, and any contrary argument would rest, at best, on untested grounds. \n\nAdditionally, it could be argued that because Hamas does not control the PA outright, aid to the PA is not the same as aid to Hamas. This may seem persuasive in some circumstances; for instance, if Hamas held only a small minority of the PA’s parliamentary seats. But that is hardly the case with regard to the current reconciliation agreement, which places equal power in the hands of Fatah and Hamas to form an interim government and appoint various ministers through consensus. Moreover, according to OFAC’s regulations, Hamas needs only an interest in PA transactions, rather than full control of the PA itself, to trigger sanctions against funding the PA. In fact, following Hamas’ election success in 2006, OFAC determined that Hamas had “a property interest” in PA business; this may have some bearing on funding the new unity government. Much like the OFAC regulations, the U.S. criminal code does not clearly specify when an FTO’s interest in an organization becomes so great that it is unlawful to provide that organization with “material support.” Moreover, the serious penalties associated with violating these criminal laws demand caution when considering whether to aid an organization in which an FTO such as Hamas plays a significant role. \n\nAnother possible method for the United States to continue funding the PA is an exception in the criminal code for persons who provide “personnel,” “training,” or “expert advice or assistance” to an FTO with approval of the secretary of state and the attorney general. This exception could allow the United States to advise PA security and police forces, but it would not permit direct financial aid. Similarly, the United States could attempt to convince non-Hamas elements in the PA to use and disseminate U.S. funds without any knowledge or participation of Hamas. Yet such a plan may not withstand legal scrutiny. If non-Hamas PA officials failed to honor the agreement and Hamas gained access to U.S. funds, prosecutors might one day argue that the persons who made the donation knew that such a result was likely and disregarded the risk. Such “willful blindness” could serve as the basis of a criminal prosecution. Or, the whole government may turn out to be Hamas-affiliated, rendering any such distinction meaningless. \n\nThe Obama administration could also instruct OFAC to grant specific exemptions so that the United States could fund particular entities within the PA. OFAC followed this strategy in 2006, announcing at the time that “consistent with current foreign policy” it was “authorizing U.S. persons to engage in certain transactions in which the PA may have an interest.” Mirroring some of the exceptions listed under PATA, OFAC exempted transactions with the Palestinian judiciary, non-Hamas members of the Palestinian Legislative Council, and various entities controlled by Abbas. \n\nAlthough the United States sought to continue supporting non-Hamas elements of the PA in 2006, it is doubtful that OFAC could repeat the same tactic now, thanks to the relationship between Fatah and Hamas. In 2006, Hamas campaigned against Fatah and tensions between the two camps remained strong after the election. Armed conflict broke out the following year despite the creation of a de facto unity government, splintering the PA. Should the current reconciliation agreement come to fruition, however, it would create a joint power-sharing government. As a result, it may be more difficult for OFAC to justify special exemptions on the grounds that certain entities within the PA are insulated from Hamas; by all appearances, they will be intertwined. \n\nLastly, OFAC could simply delist Hamas or continue allowing aid to the PA under a “general license.” But this would not do away with the independent criminal ban on providing “material support” to an FTO. To remove Hamas from the criminal law banning FTO support, either the secretary of state or Congress would have to revoke the designation of Hamas as an FTO -- a highly unlikely scenario. \n\nShould the Obama administration want to continue funding a Hamas-affiliated PA to maintain U.S. influence or otherwise promote U.S. interests, current law gives him little leeway to do so. PATA places numerous restrictions on any aid to a Hamas-affiliated PA, and any attempt by the White House to continue funding the PA in spite of PATA risks violating criminal statutes. Short of removing Hamas as a designated terrorist organization and FTO, the safest way to proceed would be on the basis of legislative action that allows White House to support the PA even under a Fatah-Hamas coalition. Without it, the Obama administration’s legal options are limited. No matter how much it may want to continue aiding the PA, then, its continued support may well be illegal.\n\n\n\nDOUGLAS N.

The Shi'ite groups, in particular, were quick to organize into political parties, set up grass-roots organizations across the country and form practical coalitions ahead of elections. Long assumed to be ideologically opposed to democracy, these groups showed they were in fact brilliantly adaptable. Their leaders, despite having little experience in kissing babies, campaigned like seasoned pros.\n\nIn contrast, Iraq's liberal parties were rank amateurs. Their leaders, despite having spent decades in exile in Western democracies (whereas most Islamist exiles were confined to places like Iran and Syria), seemed not to understand how democracy works: people like Iyad Allawi and Ahmed Chalabi had an air of entitlement, assuming that people would vote for them merely because they were modern, progressive and famous. They didn't bother to create a national party infrastructure, nor did they care to campaign. Instead, they held all-day salons in the manner of medieval monarchs giving audience to the elite.\n\nSomething very similar is unfolding in Egypt. Of all the political groups to have emerged since the fall of Hosni Mubarak — including the myriad youth movements, secular parties, leftists and remnants of the old National Democratic Party — the Muslim Brotherhood seem to have the best understanding of how democracy works. The Islamist group may have taken a backseat to the liberal youth movement that brought down the dictator, but it has wasted little time in preparing for the post-Mubarak era. Although the generals in charge of Egypt's transition have not yet announced a date for the parliamentary elections (which are expected in the fall), the Brotherhood is already campaigning vigorously, in Cairo and the countryside. The youth movement, on the other hand, seems unable to break out of protest mode. The gap between the two sides was exposed in a mid-March referendum on constitutional reforms. The Brotherhood mobilized a massive \"yes\" vote to ensure that any meaningful reforms would take place after the parliamentary elections. The liberals were split, unsure as to which scenario they feared more: a constitution written by a military-appointed panel before the elections, or one written by a Brotherhood-dominated parliament afterward. It was a rout: 77% voted yes.\n\nThe gap has not closed. Since the referendum, many liberals have sought to undermine the result by trying to force through reforms before the elections. Their great champion, former U.N. nuclear watchdog (and Nobel laureate) Mohamed ElBaradei, argues that the constitution can't wait for people's elected representatives. The youth leaders agree and are threatening to return to Tahrir Square if they don't get their way. They claim the referendum doesn't matter because the Brotherhood misled Egyptians by portraying it as a vote on religion. (The Islamists deny this, and some neutral observers say both sides played fast and loose with the facts.)\n\nThis carping makes the liberals look like sore losers, and far from democratic. Critics accuse them of trying to buy time: a postponement in the elections would give liberals more time to get their political house in order and hopefully catch up with the Brotherhood's organizational lead. Even Alaa al-Aswany, a novelist and strong Brotherhood critic, acknowledges that it ill behooves the liberals to attempt an end run around the referendum. \"The people made a choice, and we have to respect it,\" he says.\n\nThe Brotherhood, meanwhile, is sitting pretty. It has offered to form a broad coalition with liberals and leftists in the elections, and promises that there will be no attempt to hijack the constitutional reform process afterward. \"The new constitution has to be written by all Egyptians,\" says Essam Erian, a top Brotherhood leader. \"No one group should have a louder voice than the others.\" This makes the Islamists look responsible and conciliatory, and is likely to play well with voters. (See more on the Brotherhood's election strategy in posts to come.)\n\nIn Iraq, it took the liberals years to catch up with the religious parties in organizational and campaigning skills. In the last election, Allawi finally cobbled together a coalition that won more seats than any other group, only to be outmaneuvered by postelection horse trading. If Egypt's liberals aren't careful, a similar fate awaits them.\n\n\n\n\n\nBobby Ghosh, TIME's Deputy International Editor, writes mainly about conflict and terrorism.

On\nthe contrary that Act left to the Board the\nwork of applying the Act’s general\nprohibitory language in the light of the\ninfinite combinations of events which might\nbe charged as violative of its terms. Thus a\n“rigid scheme of remedies” is avoided and\nadministrative flexibility within appropriate\nstatutory limitations obtained to accomplish\nthe dominant purpose of the legislation.\n\nRepublic Aviation Corporation v. NLRB,\n324 U.S. 793, 798 (1945) (citation\nomitted). Accordingly, since its\ncreation, the Board in interpreting\nSection 8(a)(1) has found numerous\nactions as to which “Section 8 is\n\nsilent” —e.g., coercively interrogating\nemployees about their protected\nconcerted activities, engaging in\n\n140 Consistent with precedent, it will be unlawful\nfor an employer to threaten or retaliate against an\nemployee for filing charges or testifying in a Board\nproceeding involving an alleged violation of the\nnotice-posting requirement. NLRA Sections 8(a)(1),\n8(a)(4), 29 U.S.C. 158(a)(1), (4); Romar Refuse\nRemoval, 314 NLRB 658 (1994).\n\n141 See, e.g., comments of FMI, Assisted Living\nFederation of America (ALFA).\n\n142 See, e.g., comment of U. S. Chamber of\nCommerce.\n\n143 See, e.g., comments of Employment and Labor\nLaw Committee, Association of Corporate Counsel\n(“ACC”); California Chamber of Commerce\n(California Chamber); and National Council of\nAgricultural Employers (NCAE).\n\nsurveillance of employees’ union\nactivities, threatening employees with\nretaliation for engaging in protected\nactivities—to violate Section 8(a)(1) by\n“interfer[ing] with, restrain[ing], or\ncoerc[ing] employees in the exercise of\nthe rights guaranteed in section 7” of\nthe NLRA. Section 8 is equally silent\nconcerning unions’ duty to inform\nemployees of their rights under NLKB v.\nGeneral Motors, above, and\nCommunications Workers v. Beck,\nabove, before attempting to obligate\nthem pursuant to a union-securily\nclause, yet the Board finds that a\nunion’s failure to provide that notice\nrestrains and coerces employees in\nviolation of Section 8(b)(1)(A).\nCalifornia Saw & Knife Works, above,\n320 NLRB at 233, 259, 261.144\n\nBecause, as described in detail above,\nnotice posting is necessary to ensure\neffective exercise of Section 7 rights, a\nrefusal to post the required notice is at\nleast an interference with employees’\nexercise of those rights. For these\nreasons, in finding that an employer’s\nfailure to post the required notice\ninterferes with, restrains, or coerces\nemployees in the exercise of their NLRA\nrights, in violation of Section 8(a)(1), the\nBoard is acting consistently with its\nsettled practice. Some comments claim\nthat the Board has not identified any\nspecific Section 7 right to justify this\nremedy. But such specificity is not\nneeded, because all Section 7 rights are\nimplicated by an employer’s failure to\npost the required notice. As previously\nstated, there is a strong nexus between\nknowledge of Section 7 rights and their\nfree exercise. It therefore follows that an\nemployer’s failure to post this notice,\nwhich informs employees of their\nSection 7 rights, reasonably tends to\ninterfere with the exercise of such\nrights.\n\nFinally, although most violations of\nthe NLRA involve actions rather than\nfailures to act, there are instances in\nwhich a failure to act may be found to\ninterfere with, restrain, or coerce\nemployees in the exercise of their\nSection 7 rights. Thus, a union’s failure\nto provide the required notices under\nNLRB v. General Motors, above, and\n\n144 See Harkin and Miller. Although the Board\nsuggested in a footnote in California Saw that there\nwas no obligation to inform employees of their\nSection 7 rights, 320 NLRB at 232 n. 42, this dicta\nmerely indicated that no such obligation had yet\nbeen recognized in that particular context. To the\nextent it could be read as denying that such an\nobligation may exist, it is the considered view of the\nBoard that this reading must be rejected. Similarly,\nthe statement in U.S. Postal Service, 241 N.L.R.B.\n141, 152 (1979), regarding affirmative notice\nobligations is limited to Weingarten rights, and, in\nany event, does not suggest that notice of NLRA\nrights may never be required.\n\nCommunications Workers v. Beck,\nabove, violates Section 8(b)(1)(A) of the\nNLRA. California Saw & Knife Works,\nabove, 320 NLRB at 233, 259, 261. An\nemployer that fails or refuses to execute\nan agreed-to collective-bargaining\nagreement on request of the union\nviolates Section 8(d), 8(a)(5) and,\nderivatively, Section 8(a)(1). An\nemployer that fails to provide relevant\ninformation requested by the union that\nrepresents the employer’s employees\nviolates Section 8(a)(5) and (1). See, e.g.,\nNLEB v. Truitt Mfg. Co., 351 U.S. 149\n(1956).\n\nThe NLRA’s recognition that a failure\nto perform a legal duty may constitute\nunlawful interference, coercion or\nrestraint is not unique. Courts have\nexpressly held that the failure to post\nnotice required by regulation can be an\n“interference” with employee Family\nand Medical Leave Act rights. In a\nprovision that “largely mimics thle\nlanguage of] § 8(a)(1) of the NLRA,”\nBachelder v. Am. W. Airlines, 259 F. 3d\n1112, 1123 (9th Cir. 2001), the FMLA\nstates that “‘[i]t shall be unlawful for any\nemployer to interfere with, restrain, or\ndeny the exercise of or the attempt to\nexercise, any right provided under this\ntitle.” 29 U.S.C. 2615(a)(1). In\ninterpreting this language, the\nDepartment of Labor’s regulations\nspecifically state that failure to post the\nrequired notice of FMLA rights “may\nconstitute an interference with,\nrestraint, or denial of the exercise of an\nemployee’s FMLA rights” under section\n2615(a)(1). 29 CFR 825.300(e). Courts\nhave agreed, finding that the failure to\nprovide FMLA notices is an “adverse\naction” against the employee that\nsupports a prima facie case of\ninterference. Greenwell v. Charles\nMachine Works, Inc., (W.D. Ok. April\n15, 2011); Smith v. Westchester County,\n(S.D.N.Y. February 14, 2011).\nAccordingly, the Board finds no\nimpediment to declaring that an\nemployer’s failure to post the required\nnotice will violate Section 8(a)(1).145\n\nAs it explained in the NPRM,\nhowever, the Board expects that, in\npractice, few violations will be found\nfor failures to post the notice. The Board\nanticipates that most employers that fail\nto post the notice will do so because\nthey are unaware of the rule, and that\nwhen they learn about the rule, they\nwill post the notice without the need for\nformal administrative action or\nlitigation. 75 FR 80414. To that end,\n\n§ 104.212(a) of the rule states that if an\n\n145 ALFA contends that failure to post a Board-\nrequired notice is not an unfair labor practice, but\nthe authorities cited do not support that\nproposition.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_022303\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

The original Hebbian\nlearning rule, proposed by Donald Hebb in his 1949 book [Heb49], was roughly\n\n1. The weight of the synapse 2 > y increases if x and y fire at roughly the same time\n2. The weight of the synapse « — y decreases if x fires at a certain time but y does not\n\nOver the years since Hebb’s original proposal, many neurobiologists have sought evidence that\nthe brain actually uses such a method. One of the things they have found, so far, is a lot of\nevidence for the following learning rule [DC02, LS05]:\n\n1. The weight of the synapse x > y increases if x fires shortly before y does\n2. The weight of the synapse « — y decreases if x fires shortly after y does\n\nThe new thing here, not foreseen by Donald Hebb, is the “postsynaptic depression” involved in\nrule component 2.\n\nNow, the simple rule stated above does not sum up all the research recently done on Hebbian-\ntype learning mechanisms in the brain. The real biological story underlying these approximate\nrules is quite complex, involving many particulars to do with various neurotransmitters. IIl-\nunderstood details aside, however, there is an increasing body of evidence that not only does\nthis sort of learning occur in the brain, but it leads to distributed experience-based neural\nmodification: that is, one instance synaptic modification causes another instance of synaptic\nmodification, which causes another, and so forth? [Bi01].\n\n13.5.2 Virtual Synapses and Hebbian Learning Between Assemblies\n\nHebbian learning is conventionally formulated in terms of individual neurons, but, it can be\nextended naturally to assemblies via defining “virtual synapses” between assemblies.\n\nSince assemblies are sets of neurons, one can view a synapse as linking two assemblies\nif it links two neurons, each of which is in one of the assemblies. One can then view\ntwo assemblies as being linked by a bundle of synapses. We can define the weight of the\nsynaptic bundle from assembly Al to assembly A2 as the number w so that (the change\n\n? This has been observed in “model systems” consisting of neurons extracted from a brain and hooked together\nin a laboratory setting and monitored; measurement of such dynamics in vivo is obviously more difficult.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_013174\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

Mary thought it would be a good idea to share this with our clients given the events of the day.\n“Here is what I plan to say at our Aspen Insights conference tomorrow about today’s events. The last two weeks have been a\nsevere setback for financial markets and the global recovery.\n1. Today, Italian equity markets sold off sharply and were eventually shut down after the ECB (for now) rejected being\nthe buyer of last resort for Italian government bonds, as the markets were hoping. The Bundesbank apparently has\nobjections to the idea. This is a problem: Italy has issued around as much public debt as Germany, but is a considerably\nsmaller country with almost twice the debt load as a percentage of its GDP. Absent a decision by Germany to move to\nFederalism or a lot more debt monetization by the ECB, the European Monetary Union (as it is currently configured) could\nbe facing its final stretch. Today’s reported move by Italian regulators to seize documents at Moody’s regarding declines in\nItalian bank stocks is an indication of the pressure the system is under, and the possible search for scapegoats. I don’t think\nyou will find a firm that has written more often and more direly about the structural inconsistencies of the EMU than we\nhave (I have a 2-year bibliography of what we said and when, if anyone wants it). The “Sick Men of Europe” paper from\nFebruary 2010 and “Don Quixote Thanksgiving” from November 2010 go into the greatest detail on why. Our concerns\nsky-rocketed upon Greece’s financial disclosures in November 2009, after which we took portfolio decisions to back that\nup, purging exposures to the GIPSI countries from our credit, government bond and equity portfolios. Since early 2010, our\nunderweight positions in Europe represent the largest regional underweights we have ever held.\n2. Will there be another recession in the US? Our friend Marty Feldstein at Harvard puts the odds at 50-50. Sell side\nand buy side economists missed last month’s US economic rollover by a country mile, so I am not sure how much weight to\nput in their current forecasts. Most summarily dismissed our concerns that the recovery earlier this year had elements of a\nstimulus-driven mirage. Bridgewater Associates was the only firm we spoke to that consistently highlighted the broader\nprocess of household deleveraging; and cautioned that when stimulus faded, so would the US economy, given the weakness\nin household income. Their insights have been invaluable to us in terms of not stepping into this and taking too much risk\nprematurely during the three market swoons this year. Our central scenario for the US in 2012 is not another recession, but\nlow growth in the 2.0% range, which is enough of a problem given the low job creation that entails. Note that the CBO\nassumes growth rates of 3.0% to 3.6% over the next few years in their analyses of future US federal debt levels.\n3. Do not blame today’s events on the debt ceiling debate, US politicians or European regulators. If we get to the point\nwhere economic and profit fundamentals in a given market or region are not sustainable on their own, then we\nshould be underweight that region (as in Europe). Owning an asset class under the assumption that there will always be\na “Lord of the Flies” type rescue from Central Banks and Treasuries is very risky, and historically, fraught with failure. I\nremember similar logic in the summer of 1998, when the accepted mantra was that the US would bail out Russia and Boris\nYeltsin, since President Clinton would not want to see a nuclear power like Russia slide back into Soviet rule, or anarchy\n(that view turned out to be wrong). Anyone market-weight European risk out of the expectation that “Trichet and Merkel\nwill fix surely it” is taking a binary risk that impossible to handicap. Similarly, we should not start buying anything just\nbecause we think Qe3 is coming in the US (in the form of securities purchases, a permanently controlled long bond, etc).\n4. When we began this year, I made the following decision: we would risk underperforming if there was a strong equity\nrally, out of concerns about the macroeconomic landscape (weakness in the West, inflation in the East). As a result,\nwe have held less equity exposure than usual for a period of high margins, low P/E multiples and strong earnings. Instead,\nwe’ve held larger exposures to investment grade and high yield credit, and hedge funds. Over the last couple of years, our\nhedge funds (long-short funds with low net positions, macro hedge funds, distressed credit) have helped cushion portfolio\nreturns when markets declined. We won’t know until the data comes in, but we expect the same to happen this time.\n5. The “Eye on the Market” has endlessly chronicled this year the fissures which are now affecting financial markets:\nEuropean sovereign risk and inadequate bank capitalization; weak labor compensation as an Achilles heel of the US profits\nrecovery, given its negative impact on spending; the political divide in Congress over how to deal with falling government\nrevenue and rising entitlement spending; inflation risks in Asia and Latin America and the resulting need for more policy\ntightening; and the mixed track record of low interest rates to sustainability solve structural problems. The cover of the\n2011 Outlook (a printing press, out of control) expressed our concern regarding a recovery built upon a stimulus machine.\nI would contrast this with the cover of a competitor’s 2011 publication, which had a picture of George Washington crossing\n1\nAugust 4, 2011\nToday\nthe Delaware, with the caption “America’s structural resilience, fortitude and ingenuity will carry the economy and financial\nmarkets in 2011 – and beyond”. Our job is not to point to where we would like the financial markets to go, but rather\nto point to where they might end up. It’s like the scene in Oliver Stone’s Nixon, when Nixon looks up at a portrait of JFK\nand says, “When they look at you, they see what they want to be. When they look at me, they see what they are.” Our job is\nto see financial markets for what they are.\n6. All that said, we have lessons to learn here.\nToo many of our investment discussions this year focused on the negative real return characteristics of cash,\nand why to reduce it. In a world of deflation risk on financial assets (rather than of goods and services),\ncash retains substantial option value at times like these.\nWe could have connected the dots more aggressively on our views on\nweak growth and easy monetary policy, and owned more gold. While\nwe have had rising price forecasts for gold and owned it in portfolios,\nwe did not have large enough allocations.\nGiven the all-time high of US government transfers to households and\nnegative real interest rates, we should not have interpreted positive\neconomic data earlier this year as being highly representative of the\ntrue run-rate of the US economy. The same goes for the global\neconomy, which as shown in the chart from JP Morgan Securities, has\nbeen the beneficiary of a lot of stimulus that is now fading, for a\nvariety of economic and political reasons.\nGreat corporate profits are no guarantee against a problem in financial markets. Corporate profits and P/E\nmultiples were fine in June 2007, but rested on top of a systemic problem in private sector credit markets and\nprivate sector balance sheets. This year, strong corporate profits and low P/E multiples sit on top of systemic\nproblems in public sector finances.\n7. In the wreckage, as usual, there are opportunities, and we will be reviewing them with you in the days ahead. There is a\nbenefit to having held back on our firepower this year. With risk to spend held in reserve, there are oversold assets with\nconsidering, particularly among multinationals with strong balance sheets, high dividends and which trade at very low\nmultiples, something we reviewed earlier in the week.”\nMichael Cembalest\nChief Investment Officer\nThe material contained herein is intended as a general market commentary.

Sponsored by the Hanban, an organization directly under the Ministry of\nEducation in Beijing, but also with ties to the External Propaganda Leading Group of\nthe CCP Central Committee, the primary mission of CIs is to teach Chinese language\nand culture abroad. However, faculty and other watchdogs have warned that they may\npresent risks to intellectual freedom by using American universities as vehicles through\nwhich to advance Chinese Communist Party propaganda. Accusations leveled at Cls\nrevolve mainly around the exclusive use of PRC materials that promote PRC Chinese\nviewpoints, terminology, and simplified characters; the avoidance of discussion\n\non controversial topics such as Tibet, Tiananmen, Xinjiang, the Falun Gong, and\nhuman rights in American classrooms and programs; and potential infringement on\ntheoretically independent studies curricula on American campuses.\n\nAlthough proponents of CIs like to compare them with branches of France’s L’Alliance\nFrancaise, Germany’s Goethe Instituts, and Spain’s Cervantes Institute, they are\ndifferent in important ways. Unlike these other institutions, CIs are joint operations\nlocated inside—and co-funded by—a host university or secondary school for which\nthe Hanban arranges a Chinese university to supply teachers, textbooks, and other\nmaterials. The teachers are paid by the Chinese university (and hence do not hold\ngreen cards or pay US taxes). Typically, the Hanban provides a $150,000 start-up grant\nwith $100,000—$200,000 per year follow-on funding (depending on the institution)\ndirectly to the American university. Secondary schools normally receive $50,000 in\ninitial funding and $15,000 subsequently per annum. Most troublesome are two\nprovisions in the Hanban contracts with US host institutions: One forbids the Cls\nfrom conducting any activities that contravene Chinese law while the other requires\nthat the enabling contract remain confidential, making oversight by the academic\ncommunity difficult.\n\nSome participating American institutions have belatedly had second thoughts about\ntheir partnerships. In 2014, the University of Chicago terminated its CI contract\n\nwith the Hanban after months of controversy among faculty, spurred by a high-\nprofile critical article by an emeritus member.’ Since that time, at least two additional\nAmerican universities have also closed their branches (Pennsylvania State University\nand University of West Florida),!° and Senator Marco Rubio (R-FL), a leading critic of\nalleged Chinese “influence activities,” has written letters to a number of other Florida\ninstitutions hosting CIs requesting that they also be closed.'' Representatives Michael\nMcCaul (R-TX) and Henry Cuellar (D-TX) called for the same termination in their own\n\nSection 4\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_020500\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

Much\nwould depend on whether U.S. leaders could persuade others to go\nalong, which would mean convincing them that U.S. forces could\nshield them from Iranian and Iranian-proxy retaliation, or at least\nsubstantially weaken its effects.\n\nCoalition warfare would present a number of challenges to the U.S.\ngovernment.

There would thus be\ntension between the desire for a small coalition of the capable for\noperational and security purposes and a broader coalition that would\ninclude marginally useful allies to maximize legitimacy.\n\nThe U.S. administration would probably not welcome Israeli\nparticipation. But if Israel were directly attacked by Iran or its allies,\nWashington would find it difficult to keep Israel out—as it did during\nthe 1991 Gulf War. That would complicate the U.S. ability to manage\nits coalition, although it would not necessarily break it apart.

However, for 2017 we decided that a brief overview would not suffice,\ngiven the current environment of high market valuations, great policy uncertainty,\nsignificant geopolitical tensions and, in all likelihood, an unconventional US\npresidency.\n\nSince the trough of the global financial crisis, we have consistently emphasized US\npreeminence and maintained a strategic overweight to US equities relative to global\nmarket capitalization-weighted benchmarks. Tactically, we have had an overweight\nallocation to US equities and US high yield bonds from as early as mid-2008. Even\nwhen US equities became more expensive, we continued to recommend that clients\nstay fully invested at their strategic allocations. Indeed, we have reiterated that\nrecommendation in our past Outlook publications, client calls and Sunday Night\nInsight reports as many as 59 times since January 2010.\n\nBut now we have crossed into the 10th decile of valuations: US equities have been\nmore expensive than current levels only 10% of the time in the post-WWII period.\nYet we continue to recommend staying the course. We are duly aware that this\nrecommendation is long in the tooth, particularly given such high valuations and the\nunusually high level of policy uncertainty.\n\nPolicy uncertainty, both economic and political, abounds globally: uncertainty with\nrespect to Brexit (the how and when), upcoming elections in Germany and France\n(the who), transitional government in Italy (the how long followed by what) and new\nappointments to the Standing Committee in China and their significance (the who and\nwhat of any reform agenda), to name a few.\n\nWe are also facing rising geopolitical tensions that could trigger significant market\nvolatility. Tensions in the Middle East will not abate. Greater Russian involvement\nin that region is stabilizing in some respects and destabilizing in others. Further\nRussian incursions into Eastern Europe may elicit a more robust reaction from the\nWest.

Mishal\nconfronted me with Yedio?’s version of events.

The so-called ‘story’ was an amateurish\nand distorted depiction of a chief-of-staff who sees wounded soldiers, turns his\nback, deserts them and flies away. That is an evil, vain falsehood.” As Mishal\npressed me about the allegation that I had fled, I cited, by name, other officers\nwho had been there with me and had confirmed precisely the opposite. I had left\nTze’elim, along with Amnon Lipkin, a full 50 minutes after the missiles struck,\nI said. And only after the helicopters had arrived, the injuries had been treated\nand the choppers were evacuating the wounded. “A chief of staffs job is not to\ntreat the wounded, when others are doing that already,” I added. My\nresponsibility was “to keep my head, and ensure a safe and speedy medical\nevacuation.” That was what I’d done. “I’ve given years of my life to serving this\ncountry,” I said. “I have been shot at. I have shot men dead from as close as I\nam to you now. How did the hand that wrote these things against me not\ntremble?”\n\nIt was certainly high drama. But it was not an act. The way that I’d gone\nafter Yediot prompted some pundits to suggest my skin was too thin. One\ncommentator even said I was obviously not suited to politics. Yet what mattered\nmost to me was what the rest of Israel felt: people who were not reporters or\neditors, commentators or politicians. Opinion polls the day afterwards showed\nthat something like 80 percent of Israelis believed what I’d said. I think this was\nonly partly due to the details of the argument I made. When you’re under such\nclose, direct scrutiny, I’m sure viewers have an innate sense of whether what\nthey are hearing is the truth.\n\nAlmost as soon as I’d got home from the interview, the phone rang.

Brown \nNine months before cutting a covert plea deal with sex trafficking suspect Jeffrey \nEpstein, Miami U.S. Attorney Alexander Acosta was notified that the lead \nprosecutor in Epstein's case had concealed victim information in another underage \nsex crimes case, the Miami Herald has learned. \nThe prosecutor, A. Marie Villafaria, was harshly rebuked by a federal judge in \nJanuary 2007 for what he called her \"intentional and/or serious lapse in judgment\" \nwhen she failed to explicitly inform him that the defendant, a Texas man who \ntraveled to Florida to have sex with a 14-year-old girl, had a prior history of \npredatory behavior with minors, court records show. \nAcosta, her boss at the time, not only knew about Villafaria's breach — records show \nthat he subsequently defended it. Acosta assigned another prosecutor in his office to \nwrite a treatise for the judge in an unsuccessful attempt to persuade him to soften \nthe stinging language in his order. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 021729 \nSenior U.S. District Court Judge William J. Zloch copied Acosta on his order, \nnoting, \"The court is at a total loss as to why the Office of the United States Attorney \nfor the Southern District of Florida, as well as the Assistant United States Attorney \nassigned to the above-styled cause, found it appropriate to intentionally withhold ... \ninformation from the court.\" \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 021730 \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 021731 \nA. Marie Villafaria was the lead federal prosecutor in the Jeffrey Epstein sex case. The U.S. attorney's office's handling of \nthe prosecution, which led to a plea to minor charges in state court, has been harshly criticized. \nLater that year, Acosta and Villafaria put together a plea bargain for Epstein, a \nmultimillionaire money manager who sexually abused nearly three dozen teenage \ngirls at his mansion in Palm Beach. The deal, a federal judge ruled last month, was \nintentionally kept from his victims in violation of the Crime Victims' Rights Act. \nWhile the two cases are unrelated, it shows that both Acosta and Villafaria had been \nwarned about the importance of victim disclosure in sex crimes cases before the \nEpstein agreement. They nevertheless forged ahead with a pact with Epstein that \nviolated the law. \nU.S. District Court Judge Kenneth A. Marra wrote: \"When the Government gives \ninformation to victims, it cannot be misleading. While the Government spent untold \nhours negotiating the terms and implications of the [agreement] with Epstein's \nattorneys, scant information was shared with victims.\" \nThis comes as Acosta, who is now the U.S. secretary of labor, is facing mounting \nscrutiny for his oversight of the Epstein case. On Monday, White House press \nsecretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders declined to say whether President Trump has full \nconfidence in Acosta, noting that Acosta's involvement in the Epstein case is \nGG \ncurrently under review.\" \nThe Justice Department launched a probe in January into whether Acosta, Villafaria \nand other prosecutors committed professional misconduct. \nFrancey Hakes, who worked in the Justice Department's Crimes Against Children \nunit, said Zloch's comments were so brutal that it should have deterred Acosta and \nVillafaria from keeping the deal secret. \n\"It is highly unusual for a court to allege an assistant U.S. attorney has intentionally \nwithheld information. That allegation is like dropping a bomb in the legal \ncommunity,\" she said. \nThe story behind a Palm Beach sex offender's remarkable deal \nPalm Beach multimillionaire Jeffrey Epstein is a free man, despite sexually abusing \ndozens of underage girls according to police and prosecutors. His victims have never \nhad a voice, until now. \n\"It seems to show that they are not taking these cases very seriously, they are not \nadvocating for strong punishment for sexual predators, and not advocating for \nvictims in a meaningful way.\" \nVillafaria, a well-regarded 18-year veteran federal prosecutor, would not comment \nfor this story. But her lawyer, Jonathan Biran, said she has worked tirelessly on \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 021732 \nbehalf of crime victims. She received the 2011 National Crime Victims' Rights \nService Award as well as the Attorney General's Project Safe Childhood Award. \nHe also pointed out that the parents of the victim in the Texas man's case wrote a \nletter thanking Villafaria at the conclusion of the case. \n\"AUSA Villafaria has spent her 18-year career advocating tirelessly on behalf of \nvictims of some of the most serious crimes in Florida, and has received numerous \nawards for her successful prosecution of major cases,\" Biran said, adding that \nVillafaria has \"made South Florida a safer place for children and adults alike.\" \nEnticing a minor \nBy all accounts, Adam McDaniel was an awkward and shy Texas teenager who spent \ncountless hours on his computer, socializing with girls on the internet. \nIn 2005, McDaniel, then 19, traveled from Texas to Fort Lauderdale, where he \nhopped into a taxi and headed to Boca Raton to meet up with a 14-year-old girl he \nhad been talking to online for about a year. He picked up the ninth grader at a high \nschool basketball game, and drove her to a Marriott, hotel where they spent the \nnight, court records show. \nWhen she failed to come home that evening, her parents called Boca Raton police. \nOfficers tracked the pair down at the hotel the next day, where they found them in \nbed, clad in little more than their underwear, according to court records. \nMcDaniel was arrested on federal sex charges, and pleaded guilty on Oct. 6, 2006, to \nenticing a minor into sexual conduct by means of interstate commerce, which \ncarried a sentence of from five years up to 30 years in federal prison. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 021733 \nU.S. District Judge William Zloch \nAt sentencing, McDaniel's public defender, Patrick Hunt, argued for a reduced \nsentence, blaming his client's immaturity for the crime. McDaniel had been a good \nstudent at Texas Tech and had a family that supported him, Hunt told Zloch. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 021734 \nFamily and acquaintances, including a former Fort Worth police lieutenant, \nsubmitted letters to the court vouching for McDaniel's character. \nThere were other issues, however, presented to the judge. While McDaniel was \nbeing held in federal lockup awaiting sentencing, he had corresponded with his \nvictim, despite being ordered not to contact her, the court record shows. \nStill, Hunt argued that a sentence of five years was overly harsh. \nVillafaria disagreed, but conceded that McDaniel would benefit from psychological \ntreatment. She advocated for a sentence of five to sex years, which was at the low \nend of the guideline. \nIt was then that the judge heard from the victim's mother. \nIn a statement, the mother decried the emotional and mental trauma her daughter \nsuffered and the long road to recovery she had ahead of her. The mother mentioned \nshe was further upset that McDaniel continued contact with her daughter after his \narrest and she said she believed that McDaniel was still trying to manipulate her \ndaughter by blaming her for his arrest. \nThe mother pointed out that prior to their sexual encounter, McDaniel had directed \nher daughter to watch sexually explicit movies and had described for her sex \nactivities he had had with another underage girl. \nAt that point, the judge interrupted. \n\"...There has been some reference to another incident with a minor girl. What do \nyou know about that, if anything?\" Zloch asked Villafaria. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 021735 \nFormer U.S. Attorney Alex Acosta never told sexual-abuse victims of a lenient plea \ndeal for Jeffrey Epstein. \nGetty Images \nOnly then did Zloch learn that McDaniel had preyed on other girls over the internet, \nincluding a 16-year-old California girl whom he brought to Texas and impregnated. \nHe was also having another relationship with a 15-year-old girl at the time of his \narrest, Villafaria admitted in court. \nThe judge promptly sentenced McDaniel to 10 years — twice what Villafaria \nrecommended. \nThree months later, in January 2007, after reviewing the entire case, Zloch issued \nan order excoriating Villafaria for failing to tell him about McDaniel's prior history. \n\"The serial nature of defendant's seduction of minor girls was revealed for the first \ntime to the court upon the Government's response to the Court's inquiry,\" Zloch \nwrote, explaining that the defendant's past was evidence of predatory behavior that \nwarranted a harsher sentence because he may pose a danger to the community. \nAssistant U.S. Attorney Andrew Lourie was assigned to try to correct the record and \npersuade the judge to strike a portion of his comments. They argued that since \nMcDaniel had never before been charged with a crime, the history was not relevant \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 021736 \nat sentencing. The defendant's prior relationship with a 16-year-old was not illegal \nin Texas or in California, they said, and the girl classified her relationship as a \nfriendship. \nAll the relevant information was provided to the probation department and at \nMcDaniel's detention hearing, they added, making the point that it was in the record \nand therefore, not intentionally withheld by the government. \nWhile Zloch conceded that the information was part of the probation and bond \nhearing record, he said it was nevertheless the U.S. Attorney's Office's duty to \npresent the defendant's prior history with minors at sentencing. He refused to strike \nthe most critical portions of his order. \n\"Lack of candor to the court is a serious charge, and the judge has quite reasonably \nexpressed dismay that the assistant U.S. attorney apparently intended that he never \nbe given a full picture of the defendant's conduct,\" Hakes said. \nBut nine months later, in September 2007, Villafaria was in the throes of thorny \nnegotiations with Epstein's lawyers. While an FBI investigation was ongoing, \nVillafaria discussed ways to quietly resolve the case, emails show. \nA Miami Herald investigation, -Perversion of Justice,\" published in November, \nrevealed how federal prosecutors, including Acosta and Villafaria, tried to keep the \nfull scope of Epstein's crimes out of the public eye. At one point, they discussed \ncharging Epstein in Miami, instead of Palm Beach where the crimes happened, \nnoting there would be less media coverage. \nEmails also show that prosecutors repeatedly abided by Epstein's lawyers' demands \nthat his victims not be told that an agreement had been reached until after he was \nsentenced. That meant that the girls could not appear at the hearing to derail the \ndeal. Prosecutors had drafted a 53-page federal indictment on sex trafficking \ncharges, but Acosta instead allowed Epstein to plead guilty to two prostitution \ncharges in state court. In exchange, Epstein and his co-conspirators were given \nfederal immunity. \nVillafaria wrote Epstein's lawyer, Jay Lefkowitz, to discuss the wording of the \nsentencing agreement for the judge: \n\"I will include all our standard language regarding resolving all criminal liability and \nI will mention co-conspirators, but I would prefer not to highlight for the judge all of \nthe other crimes and all the other persons we could charge,\" Villafaria wrote. \nAt Epstein's sentencing, assistant Palm Beach prosecutor Lanna Belohlavek was \nquestioned by the judge about whether all of Epstein's victims were told about the \ndeal, as required by law. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 021737 \n\"Are there more than one victim?\" Circuit Court Judge Deborah Dale Pucillo asked \nBelohlavek at the June 30, 2008 sentencing. \n\"There's several,\" Belohlavek replied. \n\"Are all the victims in both these cases in agreement with the terms of the plea?\" the \njudge asked. \n\"Yes,\" Belohlavek said. \nCoincidentally, the lawyer representing one of the victims was in the courtroom that \nday. He told the Herald that neither he, nor his client, was told about the agreement. \nAcosta has not responded to the Herald's repeated requests for comment. A \nspokesman at the Labor Department told the Washington Post last month: \"The \noffice's decisions were approved by departmental leadership and followed \ndepartmental procedures.\" \nIn the past, Acosta has said that he believed the deal was the best chance \nprosecutors had of ensuring that Epstein spent some time behind bars and was \nrequired to register as a sex offender. Epstein served 13 months in the Palm Beach \nCounty jail — but he was allowed to leave for up to 12 hours a day as part of a work \nrelease program not normally offered to convicted sex offenders. \nEpstein's victims, now in their late 20S and 30s, are fighting to have his deal \noverturned and Epstein sent to prison. \nBradley Edwards, who represents several of Epstein's victims, defended Villafaria, \nsaying he believed that she was directed to settle the case and not inform Epstein's \nvictims about the deal. \n\"In my conversations with her, I came to believe that she was in a difficult position. \nShe never came out and said this, but I suspected that someone above her directed \nher to do what she did,\" Edwards said. \nDARREN K.
