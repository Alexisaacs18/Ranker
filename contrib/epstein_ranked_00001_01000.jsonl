Even if he was released on bail, the Hong Kong\nauthorities would almost certainly retain all the NSA and GCHQ files he had gone to such lengths\nto steal. He also would not be allowed to leave Hong Kong and possibly denied any access to the\nInternet. As he demonstrated by his subsequent actions, this option was not acceptable to him.\n\nOnce the U.S. criminal complaint was unsealed on June 21, 2013, which became all but\ninevitable after his video, his only route out of Hong Kong went through two adversaries of the\nUnited States, China and Russia. China, as far as is known, did not offer him sanctuary.\nAccording to one U.S diplomat, it may have already obtained copies of Snowden’s NSA files, and\ndid not want the problem of having Snowden defect to Beijing. In any case, if it had not already\nacquired the files. It could assume it would receive that intelligence data from its Russian ally in\nthe intelligence war. Whatever its reason, China did not use its considerable power in Hong\nKong to block Snowden’s exit.\n\nNor did Snowden obtain a visa to any country in Latin America or elsewhere during his month-\nlong stay in Hong Kong. As in the oft-cited Sherlock Holmes’ clue of the dog that did not bark,\nSnowden’s lack of any visas in his passport strongly suggests that he had not made plans to go\nanyplace but where he went: Moscow. His actions here, including his contacts with Russian\nofficials in Hong Kong, speak louder than his words.\n\nSnowden chose, if he had any choice left at all, the Russian option. Just as he believed Chinese\nintelligence could protect him in Hong Kong from the United States, he could assume that the\nFSB could protect him in Moscow from the United States. He was not entirely na* ve about its\ncapabilities. During his service in the CIA, he had taken a month-long training course at the CIA’s\n“farm” at Fort Peary in which counterintelligence officer taught about the capabilities the Russian\nsecurity services\n\nTo be sure, he might not have known that Moscow would be his final destination. He may\nhave naively believed that Russia would allow a defector from the NSA who claimed to have had\naccess to the NSA’s sources in Russia and China leave Moscow before its security services\nobtained that information. But that was not to be.\n\nIt is not uncommon for a defector to change sides in order to find a better life for himself in\nanother country. Some defectors flee to escape a repressive government or to find one in which\nthey believe they are more closely attuned. But Russia is ordinarily not the country of choice for\nsomeone such as Snowden seeking greater civil liberties and personal freedom. So why did\nSnowden choose Russia for his new life?\n\nThe four choices that Snowden made in 2013 did not come out of the blue. They all were\nplanned out well in advance. He applied for the job to Booz Allen in February 2013, more than a\nmonth before leaving his job at Dell. He applied to Booz Allen for his medical leave, although in\nfact he had no medical problem, a month before departing for Hong Kong. He brought with him\nto Hong Kong enough cash to pay his living expenses, according to him, for the next two years.\nHe arranged the encrypted channel with Poitras in February 2013, three months before he would\ninduce her to come to Hong Kong. He made contact with a foreign diplomatic mission at least a\nmonth before flying to Moscow and, at some point, met with Russian officials, who arranged a\nvisa-less entry for him. He called Assange in London to arrange for Wikileaks help, 13 days\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_020367\n"}}}

The decision, despite its limited scope was\ncharacterized as a “Magna Carta for nudism.’’)\n\nPornography, like nudity, offends many Americans, but there are those who would ban not only\npublic displays of pornography, but private use as well. They argue that three distinct types of\nharm are caused by pornography. The first, as with nudity, is that it is offensive to many people\nwho are involuntarily exposed to it. No empirical evidence is required to prove this kind of harm:\nif people say they are offended, that is the end of the matter. The second is that some people are\noffended by the mere knowledge that other people, who are not offending by watching it, are\nwatching it in private. Whether this type of what I call “vicarious offensiveness” warrants an\nexcept to the First Amendment raises profound legal issues. The third, very different, kind of\nharm is that pornography is alleged to cause rape and other physical violence against women.\nThis allegation, which if true would warrant legal protection, is hotly disputed and unproven, if\nnot improvable.**\n\ngroup, he might respond by striking back. Hence, such provocatively offensive expressions have been called\n“fighting words” and have been denied First Amendment protection by some courts over the years. This concept\nhas assumed center stage recently, as some Muslim groups, individuals and even nations have threatened violence\nin response to the publication of “offensive” books, cartoons and other media critiques of Islam and its prophet.\nThe stakes have also risen. Instead of merely fighting words, some radical Muslims regard insults to the prophet\nas killing and bombing words.\n\n* The issue is somewhat complicated, because it may be true that certain kinds of violent pornography (as well as\nviolent non-pornography) may be contributing factors in certain people’s decision or propensity to rape, just as\nalcohol or other drugs may be contributing factors. What is undeniably clear is that only a miniscule fraction of\nmen who view pornography go on to rape or commit violence, and that a great many rapists do not view\npornography.

By the time Shimon Peres, the\nNobel Prize-winning prime minister\nof Israel who helped resolve many of\nthe more intangible issues, died more\npeacefully aged 93 in 2016, he had\nbecome one of the most accomplished\nstatesmen of our age.\nBut perhaps the greatest casualty\nfrom that era – when there were\ngenuine expectations on both sides of\nthe Israeli-Palestinian divide that the\nconflict might be resolved peacefully\n– has been the peace process itself,\nwhich today is almost nonexistent.\nWhen, for example, I told an Arab\nambassador acquaintance I was\ngoing to see a preview of the play,\nhe simply remarked: “No one talks\nabout the peace process any more. It\ndoesn’t exist.”\nThis makes Roger’s examination of\none of the most unlikely diplomatic\ndialogues ever undertaken all the\nmore poignant, as it harks back to\nan era when reconciliation seemed\ngenuinely possible.\nThe task facing the rival delegates\nwhen they first meet is a daunting\none. For the Israelis, if the fact became\nknown that they were talking to the\nPLO, the government would most\nlikely fall. For the Palestinians, it\nwould mean an assassin’s bullet.\nAt the heart of this danse macabre\nstands Rød-Larsen, whom I met on\nseveral occasions in Jerusalem in the\nNineties when the hard work had\nbegun on implementing the deal. A\nquiet, patient man, he never seemed\nto be entirely comfortable with the\nrough-house atmosphere of the\nregion, where disputes were often\nmore likely to be resolved through\nrocks and rubber bullets than rational\npersuasion.\nToby Stephens’s portrayal of Rød-\nLarsen gives him a great deal more\nzest and personality than I recall, but\nthis neatly nuanced performance is\nkey to the pace of this fast-moving,\nentertaining take on the events (Rogers\nhas said that, in order to liven up what\nmight otherwise seem a prosaic and\nconvoluted political process, he studied\nthe plays of Noël Coward).\nMy favourite scene from the play\nis the one where the lead Israeli\nnegotiator, taking a break from\nthe negotiations, entertains his\nPalestinian counterparts by giving\nan impersonation of Arafat as an\neffeminate narcissist, a portrayal I\nfound entirely plausible from my\nown encounters with the PLO leader,\nwhose vanity knew no bounds.\nUri Savir, who was deputed by\nPeres to run the Israeli side of the\nnegotiations, was someone else I\ngot to know during that period. An\nurbane multi-linguist of an academic\ndisposition, I generally found Uri to\nbe softly spoken and thoughtful when\ndiscussing regional issues. Philip\nArditti’s portrayal of him in the play,\nthough, makes him out to be more\nlike the uncompromising, muscular\nIsraeli type, more usually found in the\nranks of the security forces than in the\ndiplomatic service.\nDepictions in theatre of almost\nanything to do with the Middle East\ntend to stir strong passions among\naudiences. I was particularly struck by\nRogers’ sympathetic understanding\nof the Palestinian predicament. “I was\nvery anxious about the combustibility\nof it,” said Rogers in a recent\ninterview. “I assumed there would be\ncontroversy [in America] only because\nsomeone would be enraged that I had\nallowed the ‘other side’ to have their\nsay.” Certainly Peter Polycarpou’s\ndepiction of Ahmed Qurei, the\nPalestinian finance minister sent\nby Arafat to make peace, admirably\ncaptures the conflicting emotions\nof enduring the pain of exile while\nseeking to wreak terrible vengeance\non the Israeli occupiers.\nIndeed, for all the quips and\nlight-hearted banter, Oslo is, at heart,\na deeply emotional drama. When the\nIsraelis finally strike a deal with the\nPalestinians during a telephone call to\nArafat’s headquarters in Tunis, they\nthink they can hear music playing\nin the background. In fact it is the\nbattle-hardened veterans of the PLO\nsobbing at the prospect of being\nallowed to return to their homeland.\nUltimately, the play is an implicit\ntragedy about the failure of both sides\nto build a lasting peace on the basis of\nthe painful concessions made during\nReproduced by Gorkana under licence from the NLA (newspapers), CLA (magazines), FT (Financial Times/ft.com) or other copyright owner.

Patrick is one of the leading sleep and dream researchers (he himself more dreams). More \nimportantly, he is perhaps the leading chronicler of the field, with many publications (including 26 entries in \nrelated encyclopedias). He is co-editor-in-chief of the \"Encyclopedia of Sleep and Dreams\" (2012) and \nthe sole author of the forthcoming \"An Introduction to the Neuroscience of Sleep and Dreams\" (Cambridge \nUniversity Press, 2018), which intends to present the latest science and to become a main textbook for \ngraduate courses/seminars. Patrick is a CTT contributor and colleague. \nWhen we asked Patrick, his first response — \"This is the ideal time to tell the sleep-and-dreams story\" — and he \ncited (in essence) your two questions, in that (i) the multiple breakthroughs are now sufficiently well \ncorroborated by numerous independent labs such that a substantial foundation for the new, deeper \nunderstanding of sleep and dreams is now for the first time (over the past few years) confirmed and \nestablished, and (ii) there are now interesting application and critical clinical questions to pose, explore and \npursue, such as for the treatment of various mental-related illnesses that have known sleep-related syndromes \n(e.g., PTSD and Depression). \nTo understand the significance of recent breakthroughs, a defining characteristic of sleep and dreams is that \nthere are two distinct kinds of sleep — REM (rapid-eye-movement) Sleep and NREM (non-rapid-eye-\nmovement) Sleep. Most dreams are associated with REM sleep (though complex). The eye movement \ngives the eponymous name, but a more important designation defines the two stages in terms of brain waves \n(electroencephalograph — EEG): REM is Fast-Wave Sleep (similar to the waking state) and NREM Sleep is \nSlow-Wave Sleep (very different from the waking state). This difference between REM and NREM sleep has \nbeen known since 1953 (different EEGs since 1937), but its deep significance has only been discovered and \nconfirmed in very recent years (as explained below). \nFollowing are the key areas of breakthrough in sleep and dreams (from Patrick). Patrick states that these are \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 025191 \nnow reproducible, non-controversial, and well-accepted among experts, although still not appreciated by the \npublic - hence the high value of our CTT TV series. The organizing idea is why and how are sleep and dreams \nessential for normal memory consolidation and bodily health / well-being. \nMemory Consolidation. There is a fundamental difference between REM and NREM Sleep for memory \nconsolidation: REM is for emotional memories, whereas NREM is for declarative and procedural memories. \nHence, understanding and dealing with REM emotional memories can lead to treatment for the many \nneuropsychiatric illnesses that have sleep/dream-related disorders or syndromes (Parkinson's Disease, \nAnxiety, Substance Abuse, many sleep disorders such as Nightmare Disorder, etc., in addition to PTSD and \nDepression). Research shows bi-directional causality between neuropsychiatric disorders and sleep disorders. \nThis is a superb example of how fundamental science breakthroughs lead to clinical breakthroughs. This fact \nthat REM is associated with emotional memories is nicely consistent with the apparent psychotic nature of \ndreams, because in REM Sleep the frontal cortex is 'down-regulated' (and the frontal cortex is associated with \nrational planning, reflection, controlling impulses), while in REM Sleep the limbic system is 'up-regulated\" \n(and the limbic system is associated with emotions and feelings) — see Neuroimaging below. This is \nwhy dream states flood the ego with emotional fantasies without rational control. However, it is also true that \nthe limbic system enables creative ideas, thus grounding in science the long-suspected idea that sleep and \ndreams can enhance creativity. \nAs Dr. Robert Stickgold, our other advisor on the series, wrote: \"It would be nice if we could talk about sleep \nand memory as if there were only one type of memory and one type of sleep. But this is far from the case. \nSleep and memory each comes in many forms, and furthermore, memories can go through multiple forms of \npost-encoding processing that must be individually addressed.\" \nImmunity / Immune System. Strengthening the immune system is now a proven product of NREM sleep. \nDiscerning the evolutionary basis for this is a key research project (i.e., it seems counter-intuitive \nthat sleeping facilitates fitness for survival in that predators lurked in the jungles and on the plains so that \ngoing unconscious during sleep does not, at first glance, seem especially adaptive). Studies of sleep in various \nnon-human animals reveals a direct relationship between longer periods of NREM (Slow-Wave) Sleep and a \nstronger immune system, especially in fighting parasites. NREM Sleep releases molecules that \nfight inflection; NREM Sleep works for the maintenance, repair and activation of the immune system. (This \ngives scientific rationale for the need or desire to sleep during illnesses.) Related are \"genetic conflict\" studies \nwith respect to REM and NREM, showing differences in heredity between material and paternal lines, and \ndifferences between males and females in which genes get \"imprinted\". \nNeuroplasticity. Exciting recent research has reversed the century-long conventional wisdom that new \nneurons are never created in adult animals/humans. The development of new neurons — neuronogenesis — is a \nvital part of maintaining normal brain and mental functioning. New neurons are being created, importantly, in \nthe hippocampus (brain organ where new memories are encoded) — but, remarkably, the neuronogensis in \nthe hippocampus occurs only/largely during REM Sleep — a stunning finding. This is another reason why \nREM sleep is needed for emotional memory consolidation (normal functioning). \nDream-Content. Although dreams have sparked human fascination and fantasy for thousands of years, only \nin very recent years, have large-scale surveys been conducted with rigorous design, classifications and \nstatistical analysis. Literally hundreds of thousands of dreams are enabling statistically significant theories, \nincluding cross-cultural analyses (similarities and differences). Dream-posting sites have revolutionized size \nand structure of dream data sets. This enables, for the first time, longitudinal studies of dreams over time. \nPatterns are repeated. For example, in general, the dreams of males and females differ in fundamental ways. \nMales will engage in fighting with other males; females with both males and females. Male dreamers \nare often the initiator of fights and the fights are usually physical. Females fight verbally. Aggressiveness \nby the dreamer is almost always in REM Sleep, rarely in NREM Sleep. (Why is a continuing question.) \n\"Lucid Dreaming\" is a new area of fascinating research. Lucid Dreaming is where the dreamer \"knows\" that \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 025192 \nhe/she is dreaming while dreaming (a talent that a small minority possesses but more can be \ntrained/developed). Lucid dreamers, while sleeping, can now communicate with experimenters by altering \ntheir brain activity and thus becoming detectable by neuroimaging techniques (see below). \nNeuroimaging. Finally, neuroimaging technology has enabled many of these breakthroughs. As such, it is \nitself a methodological breakthrough that has enabled these other content breakthroughs. Neuroimaging now \nenables detailed location of the neuroanatomy and neurophysiology of REM and NREM Sleep. In \nREM Sleep, the dorsolateral, frontal cortex is \"down-regulated\", whereas the limbic system is \"up-regulated\", \nshowing the physiological basis for the emotional, wild-fantasies of dreams (see above). (Neuroimaging will \nenable good visual images for the TV series without extra costs.) \nPatrick stresses that while these breakthroughs form, for the first time, a solid foundation for understanding \nsleep and dreams, they also open opportunities to dig deeper into the \"purpose\" of sleep and dreams, as well \nas engender a new series of questions and directions (e.g., clinical treatments of illnesses). \nAttached is Patrick's quick compiling of summaries of a few recent leading research papers (2009 — 2017, \nespecially 2015-2017). \nYou'd enjoy speaking with him, if you want. \nLove to do this series together with you. \nMuch appreciate and warm regards, \nRobert \nplease note \nThe information contained in this communication is \nconfidential, may be attorney-client privileged, may \nconstitute inside information, and is intended only for \nthe use of the addressee.

The battle for potential Supreme Court justice Brett Kavanaugh's \nnomination this fall will only amplify the polarity of the political debate that is already deeply \noverwrought on both sides. The rising tide of pressure on Donald Trump from the Mueller investigation \nshows no sign of ebbing. \nUnless the underlying political dynamics are disrupted, the outcomes of these unprecedented events will \nstill leave us with the same unsatisfactory two front battlefield of the 2016 Presidential election. \nWatching these unrelenting, compounding events since our discussion in May, I am guessing we are all \nasking the same question: now what? For the 48 percent of Americans who believe Donald Trump \nshould not be in the White House, perhaps we too want our own \"chaos\" candidate in 2020? \nShould Trump run again, this could be a \"break glass\" moment for the majority of Americans who don't \nsupport him. Do we want to break the genteel precedents of two parties running their ceremonious and \nseemingly illogical nominating process to select a candidate? (Why do Iowa and New Hampshire play \nsuch outsized roles? What kind of small-d democratic process relies on superdelegates?) The system \nfailed in 2016, with both parties producing terribly flawed candidates in a race to the bottom. We need to \nbuild a back-up plan in the event the system fails again. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 026499 \nIt's possible, of course, that we won't need a third-party candidate. Trump could decide not to run for \nwhatever reason. The Democrats could nominate a winning 2020 candidate. I am not willing to take \nthose bets. \nThe ideal candidate for a new third party is someone who is widely perceived to be that rare combination \nof both good and great. We are looking for a proven leader of men and women, someone with clear, \ndemocratic — and moral — values that reflect the best of America, not our worst. We know people like this \non the national stage now. \nAs a thought experiment, consider the possibilities of a ticket outside the partisan lanes and imagine the \nchemistry of radical combinations: Biden/Romney? Bill Gates/Hogan? Bloomberg/Haley? Howard \nSchultz/Bob Corker? Sandberg/Kasich? \nAs we have discussed narrow path to electing the first president outside the two major party primary \nsystem in 168 years is more navigable than most think. Heading into 2020, converging trends in \nAmerican's demands for a third party (a historic high of 61%), disapproval of Donald Trump holding \nsteady above 50%, and the increasingly leftward drift of the Democratic Party suggest that electorate may \nbe susceptible to merits of a new centrist party. Cynics will say that the structural impediments of ballot \nand presidential debate access, the overwhelming advantages of legacy parties' fundraising and voter \nturn-out operations preordain failure, but they're wrong; the legal and logistical hurdles are amenable to a \ncombination of lawyering and resources. The bigger, more consequential factors come in terms of \ncandidate quality and policy. I believe a candidate with five specific characteristics including a unique — \nand purposefully non-specific - policy agenda could limbo a win. \n• This is what I think a successful third-party candidate looks like; a dream third party ticket would \nstart off with enough name ID to be an instant contender. Building the name ID to run nationally is \njust too long and expensive of a process to accomplish in the 28 months until the next presidential \nelection. We can't beat a celebrity without some celebrity of our own, whether from politics, \nsports, business, or entertainment. Instantaneous name ID is so crucial because the candidate must \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 026500 \nstart out in striking distance in any three-way poll against Trump and a fill-in-the-blank \nDemocratic flavor-of-the day candidate. The media and political class will predetermine \nirrelevance otherwise. \n• A Democrat-leaning candidate would have to top the ideal third-party ticket. We need someone \nwith a shot at snaking a plurality of the vote in the blue states Hillary Clinton won (227 electoral \nvotes), but moderate enough to win a plurality in some combination of Trump states like Florida, \nPennsylvania, Wisconsin and Michigan (another 119 votes). The right candidate may even to put \nNorth Carolina, Ohio, Indiana in play for a centrist bi-partisan ticket as well (totaling an electoral \nsweep of 464 elector votes). A right leaning candidate would meet the same fate as a primary \nchallenger to Trump — for all intents and purposes we need to assume that 36% of voters won't be \ncleaved from Trump under any circumstances and run to win around them. The deep red states \nwould be off the table entirely. \n• With the Trump reality show airing daily, voters are now expecting to take their politics with a side \nof entertainment. Heretofore, ratings will matter no matter how dry the policy topic. Surely \nStephen Colbert would gladly sacrifice his executive producer Chris Licht to produce a daily \ncomedic segment of this dream candidate interviewing Americans in truck stops and McDonald's \nacross the country. A few of the \"Saturday Night Live\" script writers could certainly be enticed to \ndisguise serious debates as informative amusement. Any candidate must be committed to a near \ndaily cadence of high quality, compelling video production. It will be especially crucial to keep \nthe voters' attention during what will be a raucous Democratic primary season. Rules governing \naccess to the general election debate stage dictate that a candidate enjoy support of at least 15% of \nvoters in the months leading up to the general election. \n• This dream candidate would pledge to serve only four years and address all of the U.S.'s ticking \ntime bombs like Social Security, Medicare, health care reform, climate change, money in politics, \ngerrymandering, and infrastructure investment in a single term. This one-and-done term decouples \nour candidate from the usual politics and gives them the power of promise and deliver decisive \naction. A four-year term pledge ensures governance independent of campaign finance concerns and \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 026501 \nnarrow special interests inherent to winning re-election. This \"fix-it\" ticket would promise to force \ndecisions on all the underlying structural policy matters damaging America's long-term prospects \nand distorting our democracy. No more kicking the can down the road. \n• This candidate should also pledge to push for laws passed that reflect the will of simple majorities \nin Congress. Congress now only allows bills to move forward when a \"majority of a majority\" \nsupports the policy and on many levels seems fundamentally broken. This third-party president \ncould force votes based on a transparent reading of where the votes lie via coalition building. The \nSenate filibuster power will present a high hurdle, but a third-party candidate would be a de facto \ndisruptor of the two-party system. Party discipline could well break down, and moderates in both \nparties could form a powerful, decisive block willing to work with the new President. The policies \npassed into law may not be ideal for either Democrats or Republicans, but for the major agenda \nitems that must be addressed for America's long-term health, an imperfect fix that corrects course \nis better than those that now have us hurtling toward national bankruptcy. \nAnd if no candidate secures 270 electoral votes in 2020? The House of Representatives would choose the \nnext president. In 2016, reports suggested Michael Bloomberg declined to run on a third-party ticket for \nfear of splitting support from Hillary Clinton and throwing the election to a GOP-controlled House of \nRepresentatives who would then vote to select the president. The fear was the GOP controlled House \nwould have just elected Trump. \nWould Democratic control of the House mean that the House would pick an alternative to Trump as \npresident? Each state delegation has a single vote in selecting a president and it is the incoming Congress \n- the class elected in 2020 that would decide the election. But no matter which party has the speaker's \nchair, the GOP would almost certainly have the upper hand in the majority of state delegations \ncontrolled. Would the state delegations pick a president based on party majority control of the \ndelegation, the winner of the popular vote in each state or their own calculations as to who is best for \nAmerica? Precedent suggests that delegations use secret ballots, which means individual lawmakers may \nvote their consciences. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 026502 \nIf we recruit this ideal candidate; threading the needle of name ID, a center-left bent, a TV- savvy \ncampaign team and a pledge to serve only four years with an apartisan agenda, money and campaign \nexpertise would certainly follow. And 50 state ballot access is a function of time (starting in the fall of \n2019 would be prudential) and hard work as we have discussed and many of you have exhaustively war-\ngamed. \nPart and parcel of this effort would be motivating the often politically lackadaisical middle to vote. The \nraft of new technologies in data targeting and biometric mobile voting technology could transform the \nelectorate in the next few, amping voter participation and injecting the voices of moderates (both in \npolitical views and level of political interest) into the process. And any third-party effort must \nincorporate advocacy for accelerated adaption of these all but inevitable voter verification tools. I believe \nSilicon Valley could be game-changing allies in this effort. \nI am sure none of us doubt that chaos could potentially be unleashed by jamming three viable candidates \ninto a two-party system. An election that ends up in the House of Representatives is an uncontrollable, \nmurky and ancient process. But might that be a less scary prospect than relying on the Democrats to \nnominate a candidate who can beat Trump in 2020? \nI look forward to talking more about all of our ideas on this hopeful project in coming weeks.

Watching our\nintricate mini-war draw to its close, he made no effort to hide his enthusiasm for\nthe kind of quick, assertive battlefield maneuvers he’d long championed. But\nmore than that, his closest aide soon began sounding me out on my views about\nthe long-term organization, force balance and funding for the Israeli military. A\nfew weeks later, Arik offered me a promotion: a return to the kirya, as a two-\nstar general, to become head of planning for the armed forces.\n\nI don’t know why he chose me: the Sinai exercise perhaps, the fact he knew\nI'd studied “large and complex organizations” at Stanford, or maybe just the\nfact our paths had first crossed two decades earlier when I was in Sayeret\nMatkal. But even though it meant leaving my division command, especially\ntough since the final Sinai withdrawal was approaching, it was an offer I never\ncontemplated turning down. Not just because of the second star on my uniform.\nEver since the 1973 war, along with a few other senior officers including Dan\nShomron, I had been making the case for a shift to more mobile and less\nvulnerable forces and weapons systems. I saw the new role as a chance to help\nencourage that critically important change.\n\nThere was just one hitch: all senior military assignments required the formal\napproval of the chief-of-staff, my old friend Raful Eitan. Raful did manage to\ndelay things for several weeks. At one point, he even brought to bear a quality\nI’d never suspected he had: a sense of humor. “OK, Pll agree to promote\nBarak,” he told Arik. The next day, he said he’d meant /itan Barak — a very\ngood commander, by the way, who had been one of my instructors in officers’\nschool. Arik insisted, however. My appointment went through.\n\nAnd one, unanticipated result was that I didn’t just play the field command\nrole I’d anticipated, from our Cinerama deployments, in Arik’s toweringly\nambitious, ill-planned and ultimately disastrous war in Lebanon.

Private compa-\nnies and investors have a clear interest in democratic\npublic goods like the rule of law, which guarantees\ntheir property rights, and the transparency provid-\n\ned by free media and corruption watchdogs, which\nensures the accuracy of economic data and the fair\nallocation of state contracts. They should therefore do\nwhat they can to prevent any further deterioration in\nthe condition of global democracy.\n\nSome sectors are especially vulnerable to authoritarian\npressure, and have a special role to play in combating it.\nWe urge the film industry to reject involvement in joint\nventures with companies that have close ties to au-\nthoritarian regimes and reputations for demanding po-\n\nliticized censorship of artistic content. We also urge the\ntechnology industry to refuse business arrangements\nthat require active complicity in or passive acceptance\nof political censorship or information control.\n\nTo the European Union: We urge the EU to undertake\na comprehensive review of member states’ democrat-\nic institutions to determine whether recent changes\nhave weakened checks and balances or unduly\nprotected incumbent parties from fair electoral com-\npetition. The EU should adopt measures to publicize\ndepartures from democratic standards and develop\n\na new set of sanctions that could be imposed on\nnoncompliant governments—whether inside, outside,\nor hoping to join the bloc—even in the absence of\nunanimity among member states. In the meantime,\nthe EU should use the sanctions already in place, even\nif it means freezing a member state's participation,\nand be prepared to actually impose any new sanctions\nthat might be introduced.\n\nTo private foundations: We urge private foundations\nto recognize and oppose the current assault on\ndemocracy. With a few exceptions, the great institu-\ntions of American philanthropy have studiously—and\nshamefully—ignored the steady erosion of global free-\ndom and the rise of authoritarian powers. The recent\ndevelopments in Europe and the United States will\nhopefully shake their complacency. There is a strong\nneed for analysis, support for individual dissidents,\nand aid for societies under authoritarian threat, and as\nmany democratic governments waver in their com-\nmitment to such priorities, it is essential for private\nfunders to step into the breach.\n\nTo mainstream political candidates: We urge re-\nsponsible political figures to call out colleagues or\nrivals when they show contempt for basic democratic\nideas. Until now, politicians in the democracies have\nbeen unimpressive in their responses to opponents\nwho embrace authoritarian figures like Putin.

But I think for all of us, even Arik, the issue\nof who was behind the bombing was hardly the most urgent concern. The\nimmediate danger was a revival of the kind of rampant bloodletting Lebanon\nhad endured in the civil war. The day after the assassination, I joined a half-\ndozen other members of the general staff and helicoptered up to the Lebanese\ncapital. Arik, ignoring weeks of US pressure not to do so, had already ordered\nIsraeli troops into west Beirut — not to fight, but to take control of key junctions\nand vantage points and keep basic order.\n\nBut the question obviously on everyone’s mind was how to make sure the\nsituation remained under control. It was early afternoon when we reached an\nIsraeli command post in the largely Palestinian southwest part of the city. It was\nset up by Amos Yaron, the former paratroop commander whose division had\nlanded by sea at the start of the invasion and was part of the push north to the\ncapital. At his side was Amir Drori, the head of the northern command. They\nhad set up a rooftop observation post just a few hundred yards in from where I\nhad landed with my Sayeret Matkal team a decade earlier for the Rue Verdun\noperation. It overlooked a pair of Palestinian refugee camps: Sabra and, a\ncouple of hundred yards closer to us, Shatila.\n\nRaful was with us as well. So was Moshe Levy, the deputy chief-of-staff,\nand Uri Saguy, the head of the operations branch in the kirya. I listened rather\nthan spoke. All I could gather from the other generals’ conversation was that\nthey were trying to figure out how to handle the Palestinian camps. No one\nexplicitly mentioned the idea of Israeli troops going in, presumably because\nthey realized that, far from helping ensure order, that might well inflame things\nfurther. Even Raful, at least in my earshot, made no reference to the “several\nthousand” PLO fighters that he and Arik still wanted out of Beirut. The only\nnote that struck me as odd was a general agreement that the Phalangists had not\nbeen carrying their load of the fighting during the war. One comment in\nparticular stuck with me, though I didn’t take it as referring to the Palestinian\ncamps in particular. I can’t remember which general said it, only that everyone\nseemed to agree: “Why the hell do we have to do their fighting for them?”\n\nIt was not until the next morning, back in Tel Aviv, that the alarm bells rang\nfor me, and by then it turned out to be too late. It was Friday, the eve of the\nJewish New Year. Yet in the wake of Gemayel’s assassination, the kirya was\n\n205\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_011676\n"}}}

This means a small teaching load since the best professors\nteach the least. Three semester-long courses in a year is a light load at\na big state university.\n\nYou might wonder, as an outsider to the ins and outs of the uni-\nversity, why the best professors teach the least. You also might wonder\nwhy I knew the types of courses he would teach and what I mean by\nthat. I will explain.\n\nTo start this explanation, it is important to understand why pro-\nfessors are “rewarded” with light teaching loads. (Note the word load.\nThis is the normal way this is discussed in a university.) I was given\nan extraordinarily light load at Northwestern for two reasons. One\nreason was that universities, like baseball teams, recruit so-called “su-\nperstars” (yes, that is how they are referred to in the university) from\ncompetitors. So Northwestern had to beat Yale’s offer in my case. At\nYale I taught one semester-long course per year, so Northwestern sim-\nply made me a better offer.\n\nThe reason both of these universities would even consider such a\nlight load is that I earned money for the university. As I used to tell\nmy children when they asked “why” questions, in the end it is usually\nabout money.\n\nI was recruited by Northwestern (in 1988), but I was really being\nrecruited by Andersen Consulting. They offered Northwestern (that is,\nthey offered me if I came to Northwestern) $30 million (over a 10-year\nperiod). Yes, that’s right, $30 million. I think you can see that North-\nwestern didn’t really care what I taught or when I taught it. They\nwanted that money. And, they also wanted the prestige.\n\nBefore I go too much further, I need to explain the prestige thing\nbecause it is very important. In fact, the prestige issue for professors\nand universities is precisely the root of the problem in our education\nsystem. This will take some time to explain, so let me start simply for\nnow.\n\nWhen Harvard plays Yale in football, they are battling for prestige.\nBut the battle may not be on the field exactly. The real battle is in\nhow powerful and important the alumni who attend the game have\nbecome and how big their respective endowments have become and\nwho has the best chemistry department or business school. It is a real\nbattle. The battle is for reputation. And, although it may seem silly to\ntake this battle seriously, it is taken very seriously. There is no World\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_023935\n"}}}

Such methods will bring key challenges to democracy.\n\nCHALLENGES AHEAD WITH Al, PROPOGANDA, AND PERSUASION\n\nData-centric analyses have been long used in marketing, advertising, and campaigning over\ndecades. However, over the past few years, we have seen the rise of the use of more powerful\ntools, including machine learning and inference aimed at algorithmic manipulation, with the target\nof influencing the thinking and actions of people. Some initial uses of these methods reportedly\nplayed a role in influencing the outcome of recent US presidential elections, as well as the\nelections in 2008 and 2012. We can expect to see an upswing in methods that manipulate states of\ninformation in a personalized automated manner. These systems can be designed and deployed as\nomnipresent/persistent, and aimed at specific goals for group- or person-centric persuasion.\n\nAs our data and models of how people consume and act on information improve, and as an\nincreasing portion of information consumption is mediated through digital systems managed by\npotentially opaque algorithms, it becomes increasingly conceivable that the information ecosystem\nwould get captured by malicious actors deploying increasingly advanced tools to control, shape,\nforge and personalize information, from ads to news reports.\n\nMachine learning, in conjunction with active learning, expected value decision making, and\noptimization of allocations of key resources, such as dollars or human effort, can be targeted at\nmonitoring, understanding, and then working to influence the beliefs and actions of large\npopulations of people. Data can be collected from large-scale populations, across multiple devices\nand services, and used to make inferences about the psychologies and beliefs of people, and for\ndesigning and guiding persuasive flows of sequences of information. Uses of Al can include\nattempts to optimize stealthiness of the interventions.\n\nIn the future, a great deal of the information consumed by citizens on personal devices is subject\nto alteration by information-engineers at media corporations and governmental propaganda\noffices, such that outside a few key positions of power no one really knows what is going on in the\nworld. There is a danger of the growth of domination over time of large populations by a single\ndominant or a few systems.

Better still, from an economist’s viewpoint if not an\naccountant’s, is to trust logic. Capital is present value of expected cash flow. Its loss\nof value with time, under simplifying assumptions, is the present value of the most\ndistant and most discounted cash flow.

I think they've done a very good job of\npolicing themselves to really make sure that people including the British National Front\nand others were not included in the party, and I think you’ve seen that also with tea party\ngroups, where some people would show up and were kind of marginal members of the tea\nparty, and the tea party did a great job of policing themselves early on. And I think that’s\nwhy when you hear charges of racism against the tea party, it doesn’t stick with the\nAmerican people, because they really understand.\n\nI think when you look at any kind of revolution — and this is a revolution — you always\nhave some groups that are disparate.

The flyers talk about how cool it would be to vacation anywhere in the world, zip to work or\nschool, or have fun soaring like an eagle. The invisibility types talk about sneaking into stores and taking\nclothes or music they like, eavesdropping on conversations, and playing tricks on family members and\nfriends. What is even more interesting about these particular answers is how they divide into pure\nhedonism — flying — and pure vice — invisibility. With invisibility you can take risks at no cost, except\nfor the cost that soon becomes apparent to many of these newly donned superheroes: even if they don’t\nget caught, they still did something bad, morally bad. This ratchets up their guilt. With this realization,\nand a dip into the dark side, comes an about face, with some picking flying instead of invisibility. Rarely\ndo people stick with invisibility, but see how they might deploy their power for virtuous purposes. Rarely\ndo these superheroes realize that they can be real heroes, using their invisibility to gain covert information\nabout terrorist organizations, elicit drug traders, pedophilic priests, or abusive parents — minus the risks.\n\nIn real life, there are risks associated with every decision, some clear from the start and others\nonly clear in hindsight. As with self-control, a growing body of evidence shows that there are individual\ndifferences in risk-taking: some are risk-averse, some risk-prone, and some seemingly risk-blind, unaware\nthat they are taking risks at all. Some of these differences are evident early in life. Some of these\ndifferences are strongly associated with crime later in life. Some of these differences provide insights into\nthe invisible risks that individuals and societies confront, risks that can cause great harms.\n\nResearch on clinical populations with antisocial disorders, most notably those with a clinical\ndiagnosis of psychopathy, reveals a major cause of their high risk, costly, and violent behavior: a failure\nto experience fear, anxiety, or stress in response to highly evocative images and sounds. In contrast with\nhealthy populations, psychopaths are emotionally blasé about the things in the world that can cause harm\nor result in punishment. The problem lies in the fact that psychopaths, both adults and those identified as\ncandidates early in childhood, fail to learn about the dangers in life. Their failure to learn is caused by a\nreduction in size and activity of two critical and connected brain areas: a region of the frontal cortex and\nthe amygdala. When this system works efficiently, it allows individuals to learn about the sounds, smells,\nand sights that are associated with bad things in the world. When this system works well, individuals\nlearn to avoid antisocial, immoral, and illegal acts by developing anxiety and fear over the possibility of\npunishment and personal injury. When this system works poorly, as is the case in psychopaths,\nindividuals act as if there are no dangers or risks of punishment — a disposition that enables inappropriate\nactions. But psychopathy covers a broad spectrum, with problems that all of us confront at some point in\nour lives, some of us even repeatedly. This is important as it forces us to look at non-clinical populations\nfor the causes of individual differences in risk-taking, especially our reactivity to dangerous events.\n\nStudies carried out over several decades, in a wide variety of cultures, reveal that children begin\n\nlife with distinctive temperaments. Some are mellow, blasé about events that are startling to many.\n\nHauser Chapter 4.

He's a special guy.\" \nBut when asked by reporters about Cinque in May, Trump denied knowing anything about him or his criminal \npast. \n\"If a guy's going to give you an award, you take it,\" the President-elect said at the time. \"You don't tend to look \nup his whole life story.\" \nThe Trump transition team did not immediately return a request for comment on how the President-elect knows \nCinque or why they appeared together Saturday. \nWhile standing alongside Cinque, Trump also took a moment to address the terror attack that left scores of \nnightclub revelers in Istanbul dead over the weekend — and how the bloodbath somehow necessitates a \nMexican border wall. \n\"We will build a wall, you know that. We will build a wall,\" the President-elect told the raucous crowd. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 033210 \n\"And speaking of walls,\" he continued. \"In Turkey tonight — has anybody heard? Big disaster took place in \nTurkey tonight. Many, many, many people killed...It's a horror show. So we're going to get things running \nproperly.\" \nISIS claimed responsibility for the Saturday attack  , which left at least 39 people dead and dozens more \nwounded, calling the lone gunman who carried out the massacre a \"heroic soldier of the caliphate.\" The suspect  \nhad yet to be named and located by Turkish authorities early Tuesday. \nThe President-elect made building a wall along the country's southern border one of his main campaign talking \npoints, frequently promising his supporters that it will be a \"great\" and \"beautiful\" wall. \nBut his pledge to construct a border barrier has gone under several renditions, with the President-elect admitting \nin November that it might actually end up \"part wall, part fence.\"  \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 033211 \n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

These are the dimensions associated with emotion, and when taken away, cause us to\nperceive the other as an object. Since objects can’t feel pain or joy, we can’t share in their experience\nbecause they lack experience altogether. If that is the case, then when we perceive any human group that\nhas been dehumanized in this particular way, there should be little to no activity in those areas of the brain\nassociated with thinking, feeling, wanting, and believing. To explore this possibility, the social\npsychologist Susan Fiske placed subjects in a brain scanner and presented photographs of either extreme\nout-group members, such as the homeless and drug addicts, or photographs of other groups such as the\nelderly, middle-class Americans, and the rich. When viewing the extreme out-group, not only did Fiske\nsee little activity in an area critically related to self-awareness and the process of thinking about others\nthoughts and emotions — the medial prefrontal cortex — but she also observed an intense increase of\nactivity in the insula, a brain area that is recruited when we experience disgust.\n\nFiske’s results highlight the dangers of dehumanization. Once we turn off areas of the brain that\nare involved in thinking about others’ thoughts and emotions, and turn on areas involved in disgust, we\nhave set ourselves up for moral disengagement. As the distinguished American psychologist Albert\nBandura has documented through decades of research, moral disengagement allows people to justify harm\nby transforming lethal motives into morally justified and even benevolent ones. Moral disengagement\nallows us to excuse ourselves from moral responsibility, either disregarding the harm imposed or\nconvincing ourselves that it was justified, even obligatory. In several international studies of school-aged\nchildren, results consistently show that those who are most morally disengaged are most likely to engage\nin various forms of aggression, including bullying and repeated criminal offenses. These same children\nare also least likely to engage in helpful behavior, revealing that moral disengagement dispenses with the\ntypical process of self-censure and sanctioning that we carry around when we are morally engaged. Ina\nstudy of American prison personnel involved in death penalty sentences, executioners were more morally\ndisengaged than support staff or prison guards. Executioners were more likely to dehumanize the\nconvicted prisoner and provide moral and economic justifications. Executioners also felt less guilt\nbecause they had developed a narrative to justify their actions, one that ascribed complete fault and\nresponsibility to the victim. Support staff flipped in the opposite direction, fully involved with the\nweighty moral issues associated with ending someone’s life. In a study of people’s political attitudes,\nthose with strong right wing authoritarian views, commonly associated with fascism and submission to\nauthority, were more likely to support war by means of morally disengaging. In particular, they were most\n\nlikely to support war by justifying its necessity and trivializing the harm that will necessarily arise — for\n\nHauser Chapter 3.

The freeze would not be open-\nended, but last for 10 months, as a way of boosting the effort to restart\nnegotiations. It would apply to new construction, not work already underway. And\nit would exclude the post-1967 neighborhoods inside the expanded city limits of\nJerusalem. Like his other moves, it was also dismissed as insignificant by the\nPalestinians. Though there was a formal restarting of the talks, they went almost\nnowhere during the period of the freeze, which Bibi cited as a reason for not\nextending it further. From then on, the negotiations produced even less. I didn’t\nbuy the narrative that this was entirely Bibi’s fault. Abu Mazen remained\nsteadfastly, deliberately passive. Obviously not inclined to take the risk of further\nwidening his rift with Hamas in Gaza, he was content to echo the Obama\nadministration’s argument that nothing could happen until there was a settlement\nfreeze. Once the freeze was announced, he went through the motions, avoiding all\nthe difficult issues, in the expectation Washington would ensure the freeze was\nrenewed. President Obama’s initial Mideast moves had made it much easier for\nAbu Mazen to avoid any serious engagement. In contrast to past presidents, Obama\nhad placed almost all of the onus for progress on Israel. But the end result also\nsuited Bibi. Though I never entirely gave up hope of persuading him it was in\nIsrael’s interest to seek a resolution of our conflict with the Palestinians, it became\nmore evident as the months went on that his aim was simply to keep things ticking\nover, and avoid any major new crisis.\n\nHe appointed an old personal friend — a corporate lawyer named Yitzhak\nMolcho — as our negotiator.

We spoke in detail about the state of the\nnegotiations. With Molcho still in the room, I phoned Bibi in Jerusalem on the\nsecure phone line. I said I’d just been updated on the talks, and it seemed clear\nthere were a number of suggestions Israel could make, with no domestic political\nrisk but with every prospect of improving the atmosphere and accelerating\nprogress. “Yitzhak is one of Israel’s top lawyers,” I said. “He’s struck dozens of\ndeals in his life. But he strikes a deal when that’s what his client wants. You are the\nclient. If you tell him: bring me back the best deal you can — not a peace treaty, just\na deal on a specific issue — he’ Il do it. But if his brief is simply to negotiate, he can\ngo on negotiating forever.

Here, she reports on the\nHollywood glamour, excitement and social\nshenanigans, including celebrating with\nColin Firth, Jesse Eisenberg, Elton John,\nOprah Winfrey and many more.\nphotographs by PATRICK MCMULLAN\nQaddafi is hunkering\ndown in Tripoli, giving\npress interviews, denying\nthat rebels are taking\nover Eastern Libya. Oil\nprices are shooting up over one hundred\ndollars a barrel. The U.S. government is on the\nverge of a shutdown. These are not the topsecret\nopening lines of Aaron Sorkin’s new\nscript, but the global headlines of a world\nspinning out of control as I head to Los\nAngeles like an overdressed lemming to attend\nthe 83rd Academy Awards and attempt to\nmake sense of artists thrust into combat.\nFor the second year, nearly 6,000 Academy\nmembers have nominated 10 films and the\nbattle seems to be pared down to 2. The\nbeloved instant classic, The King’s Speech,\nmarches into the arena as the frontrunner, but\npassionate supporters of the edgier (critics’\ndarling) The Social Network have not conceded.\nThe ballots are counted, the party invites are\nout and still the feelings are raw. Nominees are\nexhausted from campaigning.\nWoody Allen and George Lucas tell me they\nare no longer members of the Academy\nbecause pitting artists against each other to\ndetermine the quality of their work is insane.\nThey are right. My event and publicity company\nis considered Switzerland by the studios, as\nwe help every filmmaker to present his work.\nHowever, this year, against my better judgment,\nI am somewhat emotionally sucked in.\nIn 2005, I met the unknown 32-year-old\nEnglish director Tom Hooper on his first film\nfor HBO, Elizabeth I starring Helen Mirren.\nHelen later wins an Oscar for portraying\nQueen Elizabeth in The Queen. Queen\nElizabeth is the daughter of King George VI,\nportrayed by Oscar-winner Colin Firth in The\nKing’s Speech directed by Hooper. No degrees\nof separation.\nAt the Telluride Film Festival, Tom Hooper\nbathed in the glory of a hysterical standing\novation alongside Colin Firth and Geoffrey\nRush at the very first public screening of that\nfilm. Two weeks later at The Toronto Film\nFestival, Harvey Weinstein stood with his\nfilmmakers witnessing the same reaction. The\nfilm won The Audience Prize. Their strategy\nwas to say nothing, do nothing. They have a\npossible Oscar winner—four out of five past\nBest Pictures have premiered in Toronto.\nCut to New York City at the end of\nSeptember. It’s opening night at The Film\nSociety of Lincoln Center. One of America’s most important\nand prolific producers, Scott Rudin, along with Jesse\nEisenberg, Andrew Garfield and Aaron Sorkin, are in a\nbrightly lit box waving down to their equally hysterical\naudience who have just seen The Social Network. The film\nopens the next day to rave reviews and endless publicity.\nDavid Fincher is off making The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo.\nAaron Sorkin becomes the face of the film and an immediate\nshoo-in for the adapted screenplay Oscar.\nThe Hamptons International Film Festival in October\nsuddenly becomes a launching pad for 127 Hours, where\nstar-cum-Yale/NYU student James Franco appears. More\nOscar buzz. Producer/director Danny Boyle (Oscar winner for\nSlumdog Millionaire) stays in London all fall directing the play\nFrankenstein. Black Swan also unspools there in a tiny theater as\nMadonna, Alec Baldwin and Harvey Weinstein slip in the\nback. Darren Aronofsky is hailed a genius. Natalie Portman is\ninstantly the hot nominee for Best Actress. Both films are sensations,\nbut it’s The King’s Speech that wins The Audience Prize.\nMid-November: David O. Russell and Mark Wahlberg\nsneak The Fighter in Manhattan. As their audience erupts in\ncheers, I tell producer/actor Wahlberg, “Clint Eastwood is\ngoing to kill himself for not directing this.” He says, “You’re\nwrong. He turned it down because he’s done it. He’s seen it\nand he loves it.” David O. Russell becomes my new Clint\nEastwood. Christian Bale and Melissa Leo are hailed the\nsupporting actors to beat.\nTrue Grit, directed by the Coen Brothers and also produced\nby Scott Rudin, finally throws its cowboy hat in the ring in\nmid-December at the Ziegfeld as the last serious Oscar\ncontender for Best Picture. It gallops off to box office gold.\nThe Social Network now cements its battle cry with one\nword: relevance. Mark Zuckerberg lands on the cover of\nTime Magazine as “Person of the Year.” A smart and extensive\nad campaign positions the film in the lead. Critics and\npundits proclaim the race is over. Everyone goes on holiday.\nThis is one of the few times in Harvey Weinstein’s life that\nhe’s caught off guard. He quickly mobilizes an inner team of\n15 and conducts strategy meetings 7 days a week, including\nChristmas. They’re like a Chinese restaurant: always open. He\nsends screenwriter David Seidler and Tom Hooper to every\ncorner of the country doing Q&As until they are both blue in\nthe face from “finding their voice.” SAG voters begin seeing\nthe film two and three times.\nIn January at the Golden Globes, about 88 foreign journalists\ngive awards to The Social Network for Best Drama, Director\nand Screenplay. The film is still perceived as the Oscar winner\nand nobody can stop the steamroller. Only Academy voters\ndisregard these awards.\nThe King’s Speech wins the PGA in L.A. Everyone is totally\nsurprised when Tom Hooper goes on to win the DGA. After\na tremendous amount of hard work by team Weinstein, the\nactors win for the SAG Ensemble. The BAFTAs reinforced\ntheir lead; the film is now the frontrunner. It takes the media\na few weeks to catch on.\nEmma\nStone\nCollin Firth and\nAnne Hathaway\nGwyneth\nPaltrow\nSandra\nBullock\nTom Hooper\nCarolina\nHerrera\n\nJennifer\nLawrence\nMarisa\nTomei\nLeslie Mann\nand Judd\nApatow\nMelissa\nLeo\nSteve\nMartin\nSteven\nTyler and\nLiv Tyler\nGeorge Hamilton and\nKimberly Blackford\nKevin\nSpacey\nL’Wren\nScott and\nMick\nJagger\nI whisper to Harrison\n[Ford], “That looks just like\nJohnny Depp.” Harrison rolls\nhis eyes and reluctantly\nintroduces me to his\nfriend . . . Johnny Depp.\nThe Daily Mail announces Her Royal Highness Queen\nElizabeth has enjoyed a private screening of The King’s\nSpeech and is “moved” by the film. With no proof the Queen\nhas actually seen the film, press agents send out a global press\nrelease thanking her Majesty for the endorsement.\nFRIDAY, FEBRUARY 24\nMid-day, I arrive at The Beverly Hills Hotel. As the housekeepers\nunpack my bags upstairs I peek into the Polo Lounge\nand find Warren Beatty in a booth. I tell him I’m rooting for\nhis wife, Annette Benning, and love her film, The Kids Are All\nRight. Warren says The Social Network will win.\nThis year I am two days late arriving to Oscar weekend. I\nam shown to a very, very small room—the size of a broom\ncloset. Uncharacteristically, I have a slight melt down. I am\nmoved. The housekeepers run down the hall with my clothes\nflying. The hotel is sold out, so I get someone else’s room.\nAnother unsuspecting victim checking in downstairs will get\nthe broom closet.\nIt is cold, grey and rainy. Taffeta, organdy and embroidered\nsilk evening clothes hang in my closet. I stay in my sweaters\nand fur coat, and head to Arianna Huffington’s home in\nBeverly Hills where she and Wendi Murdoch are hosting a\nparty for Tom Freston’s wife, the beautiful, blonde Kathy.\nHer book is called Veganist: Lose Weight, Get Healthy, Change\nthe World—perfect for monks.\nArianna has just sold the Huffington Post to AOL for $315\nmillion dollars and is rumored to have personally landed\naround $20 million. She is euphoric as she greets Nicole\nKidman and Keith Urban at the door. Other drenched power\nplayers include Disney’s Bob Iger and wife Willow Bay,Fox’s\nJim Gianopulos, Candice Bergen and journalist daughter\nChloe Malle, Google’s Eric Schmidt, Oliver Stone escorting\nhis daughter Tara and avoiding questions about Charlie\nSheen, Moby, Jamie Niven, Brian Grazer, Vivi Nevo, CBS’s\nLes Moonves and Julie Chen, Rob Reiner, Paramount’s Brad\nGrey and fiancé Cassandra Huysentruyt and Jeff Bezos.\nHors d’oeuvres include pigs in blankets—a food group not\nmentioned in Kathy’s book.\nThe action migrates to UTA Jim Burkus’ home for a party\nfor True Grit’s Ethan and Joel Coen. I pass Ron Howard on\nthe way in and he says, “Keep me on your list.” Is he kidding?\nSunrise and Mark Ruffalo, Focus Feature’s James Shamus,\nNancy Meyers and John Goldwyn mingle. Adorable Hallie\nSteinfeld is there with her parents. I am trying to fix her up\nwith Justin Bieber. She giggles, “Peg, I am only 14.”\nI am face to face with Harrison Ford and stupidly tell him\nI love him in Morning Glory. He’s looking at me in utter\ndisbelief, but I will not shut up. A gorgeous guy is inches away\nin a hat and glasses. I whisper to Harrison, “That looks just\nlike Johnny Depp.” Harrison rolls his eyes and reluctantly\nintroduces me to his friend . . . Johnny Depp. I babble a bit\nabout his great work then run for cover in a corner next to my\nbuddy, Jerry Bruckheimer.\nI head over to the CAA/Bryan Lourd’s “Friday Night\nParty.” Torrential rains and horrific winds cause a traffic jam\nthat makes it impossible to get near the house. The world’s\nmost famous faces cower under black umbrellas and make a\nrun for it. Bryan Lourd and Bruce Bozzi receive friends at the\ndoor all night.\nInside, Uma Thurman tells me she finally moved into a\ndoorman building in New York after being terrorized by\nstalkers for years. Ben Walker talks about Abraham Lincoln:\nVampire Hunter, which he is about to shoot, while his fiancé,\nMamie Gummer, looks sexy shivering in a white satin gown.\nProducer Jon Kilik mentions he oversaw a new cut of Julian\nSchnabel’s Miral, to be released in March. Bennett Miller,\nstanding with Kristin Gore, says Sony loves his new film,\nMoneyball, and Brad Pitt is terrific. (When is Brad Pitt not\nterrific?) Sandy Gallin tells me he has an actual job\ndecorating Jeffrey Katzenberg’s home. I congratulate Barry\nLevinson’s son Sam, a director, for winning the writing\naward at Sundance for his first film, Another Happy Day.\nAlso seen floating around are Taylor Swift and Jake\nGyllenhaal—but not together—Sean Penn, Tom Cruise and\nKatie Holmes, Anderson Cooper, Hilary Swank, Kelly Ripa,\nPaul Haggis, Marisa Tomei, Kate Beckinsale, Demi Moore\nand Ashton Kutcher, Kate Hudson, Gerard Butler, Renee\nZellweger with Bradley Cooper, Biutiful director Alejandro\nGonzalez-Inarritu, Kathryn Bigelow and Mark Boal, Ellen\nBarkin (who is headed to Broadway in The Normal Heart this\nspring) and CAA’s Kevin Huvane, Richard Lovett and Hylda\nQueally. Sony Classic’s Michael Barker tells me The Social\nNetwork will win.\nTired celebs try to go home, but limo lock is at a standstill.\nCell phones don’t work in the area. Two hundred swells\nbecome party prisoners and happily hang out till 5 a.m.\nSATURDAY, FEBRUARY 26\nOut comes the sun and dries up all the rain. IAC chairmen\nand owner of Newsweek/The Daily Beast Barry Diller\nand his wife Diane Von Furstenberg (with her kids Alex\nand Tatiana) host their 15th annual lunch for Graydon\nCarter in their Coldwater Canyon home. Barry introduces\nme to his star guest, Gov. Jerry Brown, just elected to his\nthird (nonconsecutive) term as California governor.\nLike last year, enormous clear plastic tents are erected\non the hill near the house. Long wooden picnic tables sit\non oriental rugs covering the soggy ground. VIPs wears\nwinter clothes, comfy sweaters and sensible shoes. I arrive\nin a fur coat.\nStephen Gaghan and\nMinnie Mortimer\nScarlett\nJohansson\nCharlize\nTheron\nLourdes Leon\nand Madonna\nArmie\nHammer\nKate\nBeckinsale\nAaron Sorkin\n\nGeorgina\nChapman\nHilary\nSwank\nCameron\nDiaz\nWendi Murdoch, Kathy Freston and\nArianna Huffington\nNatalie Portman\nBrian Grazer and Jeff Bezos\nTom\nFord\nEverybody knows everybody, and it doesn’t matter if\nyou have a hit film or T.V. show this season. Oprah\nWinfrey kisses David Geffen, casually chats with former\nDisney C.E.O. Michael Eisner and current Sony Chief Sir\nHoward Stringer and Rob Weisenthal. Brett Ratner\narrives with his houseguest Jean Pigozzi, who is allowed to\ntake photographs. Graydon greets people with chic wife\nAnna by his side.\nIngrid Sischy and Sandy Brant, Rupert Murdoch,\nRon Meyer, Francesco Clemente with his twin boys and\nTom Ford chat each other up. People to watch include\npregnant Victoria and David Beckham with Lynn\nWyatt, Fran Lebowitz, Larry Gagosian and Shala\nMonroque, Ben Silverman, Debbie and Allen\nI head over to the CAA/Bryan\nLourd’s “Friday Night Party.”\nTorrential rains and horrific\nwinds cause a traffic jam that\nmakes it impossible to get\nnear the house. The world’s\nmost famous faces cower\nunder black umbrellas and\nmake a run for it.\nGrubman, Sotheby’s Tobias Meyer and Mark Fletcher and\nStephen Gaghan and Mini Mortimer wearing her oversized\ncat glasses.\nBruce Cohen has invited me to the Oscar broadcast\nrehearsal. Inside the Kodak Theater’s massive auditorium,\nI find a seat next to his proud parents. I\nwatch Josh Brolin and Javier Bardem come out in\nwhite dinner jackets and flub their lines as they\npretend to present Best Adapted Screenplay and\nBest Original Screenplay. Josh will later tell me\nthat their acting methods are completely opposite:\nhe’s a quick study and is very creative and\ncomfortable ad-libbing; Javier, whose mother\ntongue is Spanish, likes to have every syllable\nprinted out to study with a dialect coach. Life-size\nphotos on cardboard plaques are taped to each\nnominee’s chair. I memorize their location so when I\nreturn Sunday I can quickly kiss them all.\nBack at the Beverly Hills hotel I slip into my black\ntulle Dennis Basso cocktail dress with a plunging\nneckline and put on my mother’s jewels. Jim\nColeman takes me to the “Night Before Party” in the\nhotel. This is Jeffrey Katzenberg’s 9th annual A-lister event\nbenefiting The Motion Picture & Television Fund where they\nraise $6.5 million dollars in 1 night. I walk into Valentino,\nwho gives me an approving once-over. I tell him and\nGiancarlo Giammetti that Woody Allen’s new film,\nMidnight in Paris, is opening the Cannes Film Festival and\nthey must bring the yacht.\nElton John and David Furnish join our conversation so of\ncourse we ask for intimate details about baby Zachary. I\nsegue over to Amy Adams, who, like them, mentions she\nhates leaving her baby in the hotel room. Next stop is Kate\nCapshaw in a black bowler hat chatting with Steven\nSpielberg’s god-daughter, Gwyneth Paltrow. I have known\nSteven for years (in 1982 I was a publicist on E.T.). I now tell\nhim I’m going to the Lincoln Center opening of War Horse\nwith Kathy Kennedy and Frank Marshall and cannot wait to\nsee his movie version.\nI meet sweet Jennifer Aniston, her new haircut and her\nperfect little body. Her date tells me her secret is a half-hour\non the treadmill everyday—such an understatement. I tell\nJesse Eisenberg I was on his plane home from the Baftas last\nweek, but he was hiding under his hoodie. He says innocently,\n“You should have said ‘hello.’ I always cover my head because\nI think my curls make me look like a girl.”\nThe charity gives us a coupon booklet redeemable at\nvarious booths. Rich people run around like lunatics, collecting\ngifts for their housekeepers. Among the shoppers are\nSteven and Heather Mnuchin, Viacom’s Deborah and\nPhilippe Dauman, Tamara Mellon, Christine Taylor and\nBen Stiller, Cate Blanchet, Susan and Robert Downey Jr.\nand Debra and Hugh Jackman.\nNext stop is The Weinstein Company’s party at the Soho\nHouse sponsored by MontBlanc. Long gone are the funky\nMiramax Saturday night soirees where nominees spoofed\ntheir own films in homemade costumes and ad-libbed\nhilarious skits. No more grown men dressed as Anna Paquin\nplaying the piano in hopes of winning a Max Award.\nAs I come in, a 400-pound gorilla refuses to let me on the\nelevator. Once on, I see Jennifer Lopez in the corner and\nremind her we met on Len Blavatnik’s yacht in Cannes. She\ngraciously pretends to remember me. Her manager, Benny\nMedina, is kicking me.\nI slip into Colin Firth’s booth to have a tête-à-tête with him\nand his wife Livia Giuggioli. Jokingly, I suggest he say “I’m\nspeechless” when he wins. Colin patiently assures me many\npeople, far more clever than I, thought of this. He then says that\nothers are waging bets on whether he might subconsciously\nstutter. I grill him about his wardrobe, assuming he will be\nwearing a new Tom Ford tuxedo. He tells me both he and\nFord will be in older Ford models. I tell him I made rich-butthrifty\nCharles Ferguson, director of Inside Job, spend $6,000\ndollars for a new Tom Ford tux.\nIn the back room, Jennifer Lopez is now seated with\nWeinstein’s wife, Georgina Chapman. Helena Bonham\nCarter, her live-in-lover Tim Burton and her mother Elena\ncirculate. Star power includes Adrien Brody, Mary-Kate\nand Ashley Olsen, Cameron Diaz, Camilla Belle, Chace\nVera\nFarmiga\nAdrien\nBrody\nAndrew\nGarfield\nOliver Stone and Tara Stone\nClaire Danes and\nHugh Dancy\nHailee\nSteinfeld\nTaylor\nSwift\n\nDonald and Melania Trump\nDonna\nKaran\nLynn\nWyatt\nBarry\nDiller\nJon Hamm and\nJennifer Westfeldt\nAnderson\nCooper\nChloe Malle and\nCandice Bergen\nDiane von\nFurstenberg\nTory\nBurch\nCrawford, Claire Danes and Hugh Dancy, Darren\nAronofsky, director John Wells, Kerry Washington, Piers\nMorgan, Rachel Zoe, Sean Parker, Zack Braff and Leonardo\nDicaprio with Bar Rafaeli. Speech filmmakers are functioning\non high anxiety.\nSUNDAY, FEBRUARY 27\nProducer Donna Gigliotti is my date to the awards. We are\nboth so nervous we arrive at the Kodak Theater at 3 p.m. and\nnobody is there. We are driven around for an hour. When we\narrive back at the world’s most famous red carpet, I guide\nDonna through security check-in to the extreme right to\nmake sure we get on camera. I teach her the red carpet\nhustle, which is five steps forward, three steps back, one inch\nbehind a couture-clad nominee. We greet Kevin Huvane as\nSandra Bullock is talking to ABC-TV and a billion people see\nme wearing a black Marchesa gown. Five steps forward, three\nsteps back, we next meet Gwyneth Paltrow, and I hook up the\nback of her dress while another billion people see me correct\nthe fashion malfunction. Five steps forward, three steps back,\nwe’re now posing behind Nicole Kidman and Keith Urban.\nOur Blackberrys begin buzzing; the world has seen us.\nJames Franco and Anne Hathaway are hip hosts. This is the\nyear of no surprises. But it isn’t until Hilary Swank yells out\nHooper’s name for Best Director that Harvey’s gang finally\nrealizes they are getting the Oscar for Best Picture after all.\nHarvey is sitting in Spielberg’s seat as Spielberg announces\nthe win from the stage. Producers Iain Canning, Emile\nSherman and Gareth Unwin leap up and kiss each other.Six\nmonths of grueling work have finally paid off.

The invitation features a gold hologram that transmits\na radio frequency of a photo and details about the\nguest to VF staff as they arrive. The next day “Page Six” will\nreport that the backup private security firm is run by a\nformer Israeli operative, when in fact they are Irish\nCatholics from Staten Island.\nThere’s a hierarchy of arrival times. At 5 p.m. the inner\ncircle of Graydon’s 141 best friends attend a seated dinner.\nThey include Barry Diller and Diane von Furstenberg,\nFrancis Ford Coppola, Jon Hamm and Jennifer Westfeldt,\nBetsey Bloomingdale, Tory Burch and Lyor Cohen,\nCarolina and Reinaldo Herrera, L’Wren Scott and Sir\nMick Jagger, Naomi Watts and Liev Schreiber, Wendi\nStark, George Hamilton, Judd Apatow, Jackie and Joan\nCollins, Donna Karan and Steve Martin.\nThe best and the brightest talent in town arrive at 9 p.m.\nEvery single winner shows up.

I introduce Melania and Donald Trump\nto David O. Russell as The Trumpster gushes about The\nFighter. David tells Donald he used to be a waiter/bar tender\nat many of Trump’s parties. Donald smiles as if looking at yet\nanother apprentice. He then offers me a ride home on his\nplane; he’s leaving in 10 minutes. Too bad James Franco\ndidn’t know because he is presently sitting on a commercial\nflight back to school, skipping his own after-party. The rest of\nthe guests’ social standings are determined by half-hour\nincrements. VF’s Beth Kseniak, Matt Ullian and Jane Sarkin\ntell me the list is cut down to 800 this year.\nAt 11:30 p.m. there is another celebrity migration up the\nhill to Madonna manager Guy Oseary’s house.

Colin Firth, Tom Hooper\nand David Seidler show up at 4:30 a.m. at The Four\nSeasons Hotel for a live broadcast on “The Today Show.”\nFunctioning on an adrenalin rush, they return to the\nKodak Theater with Geoffrey Rush to appear on Oprah’s\nlive broadcast.\nBy the end of this year’s thrilling race between two\ngreat producers—Scott Rudin and Harvey Weinstein—\nFacebook and Twitter are credited for aiding political\njustice from the streets of Cairo to Tripoli.

The widening scope of the crisis, which\nincludes all parts of the world, confirms this unity and the common international pursuit. In addition, President\nObama’s public statement, which verifies that the United States cannot overcome the global crisis on its own, is\nfurther confirmation of the unity of the economy and the market. Other lessons learned from the=2 Ocrisis is\nrealizing the urgent need to develop the regulations, terms of reference and working mechanisms of\ninternational financial institutions to be commensurate with the unified markets and economies, and the\ninvolvement of many influential players.\n\nIn the United Arab Emirates, we perform a wide range of reviews through specialized federal and local\ncommittees which are well aware that within the challenges of the crisis, remain many opportunities.

Financials...\n\ne To analysts looking at USA Inc. as a public corporation, the financials are challenged\n\n- Excluding Medicare / Medicaid spending and one-time charges, USA Inc. has supported a 4% average net\nmargin’ over 15 years, but cash flow is deep in the red by negative $1.3 trillion last year (or\n-$11,000 per household), and net worth2 is negative $44 trillion (or -$371,000 per household).\n\ne The main culprits: entitlement programs, mounting debt, and one-time charges\n\n— Since the Great Depression, USA Inc. has steadily added “business lines” and, with the best of intentions,\ncreated various entitlement programs. Some of these serve the nation’s poorest, whose struggles have\nbeen made worse by the financial crisis. Apart from Social Security and unemployment insurance,\nhowever, funding for these programs has been woefully inadequate — and getting worse.\n\n- Entitlement expenses (adjusted for inflation) rose 70% over the last 15 years, and USA Inc. entitlement\nspending now equals $16,600 per household per year; annual spending exceeds dedicated funding by\nmore than $71 trillion (and rising). Net debt levels are approaching warning levels, and one-time charges\nonly compound the problem.\n\n- Some consider defense spending a major cause of USA Inc.'s financial dilemma. Re-setting priorities and\nstreamlining could yield savings — $788 billion by 2018, according to one recent study*® — perhaps without\ndamaging security. But entitlement spending has a bigger impact on USA Inc. financials. Although\ndefense nearly doubled in the last decade, to 5% of GDP, it is still below its 7% share of GDP from 1948 to\n2000. It accounted for 20% of the budget in 2010, but 41% of all government spending between 1789 and\n1930.\n\nNote: 1) Net margin defined as net income divided by total revenue; 2) net worth defined as assets (ex. stewardship assets like national\nparks and heritage assets like the Washington Monument) minus liabilities minus the net present value of unfunded entitlements (such as\nSocial Security and Medicare), data per Treasury Dept.'s “2010 Annual Report on the U.S. Government’, 3) Gordon Adams and Matthew\nLeatherman, “A Leaner and Meaner National Defense,” Foreign Affairs, Jan/Feb 2011)\nwww.kpcb.com\n\nUSA Inc. | Introduction 15\n\n...Drilldown on USA Inc.

A quick\nskim through the many blogs commenting on this work reveals a common refrain that makes the key\npoint: many that have taken this test, whether focusing on race, sexual orientation, or political affiliation,\nopine that the test must be invalid because they explicitly disavow any groupish biases. But that’s the\npoint! What we disavow explicitly has less impact than we would like on what we hold implicitly.\n\nIf our implicit system champions one view of racism and our explicit system another, then we are\ncontinuously faced with an epic conflict. To resolve this conflict, and enable the explicit system to emerge\ntriumphant, requires self-control, keeping the implicit system quiet. Studies of the brain provide\ninteresting insights into this process. Recall that when we experience conflict, regardless of its content,\nthere is activation in the anterior cingulate. When we exert self-control, regardless of content, there is\nactivation in particular regions within the prefrontal cortex. When we feel threatened by a dangerous\nanimal or person, there is activation in the amygdala. These three brain regions tell an interesting story\nabout how we process race. When Caucasian subjects view faces of Black as opposed to Caucasian\npeople staring at them, there is greater activation in the amygdala. This racial difference disappears if\nsubjects view photos of faces looking away or with eyes closed. It is the potentially threatening aspect of\na face staring at you that engages the racial difference. If you briefly flash faces at Caucasian subjects so\nthat they are unaware of them, there is stronger activation in the amygdala for Black than Caucasian\nfaces. But if you present the faces for long enough, allowing them to enter conscious awareness, the\namyegdala’s pattern of activity goes away, replaced instead by strong activation in the anterior cingulate\nand prefrontal cortex. Staring longer at someone from a different race triggers a sense of conflict and\nengages the system of self-control, pushing down our implicit racism to enable more explicit neutrality\nand equality.\n\nWhat this work shows is that understanding our attitudes and actions toward those of the same\nand different race requires consideration of implicit and explicit components. Think of this process like a\nhand pushing down on an automatic watering fountain. The machinery that produces the pressure to push\nwater out of the holes in the fountain operates without concern for what happens outside in the world. The\nhand that pushes down is under human control, consciously guided, perhaps with the aim of simply\nspreading the water or feeling its’ coolness on a hot day. Though the hand may try to control the\nmovement of the water, it may only do so to some extent, guided by the power of the automatic engine\nbelow. Thus, we have an automatic bottom up mechanism and a controlled top down mechanism. So it is\nwith race. The bottom up mechanism operates automatically, pushing forward our implicit prejudice. The\ntop down mechanism attempts to exert control, when and where it can, to avoid looking racist, sexist, or\n\nwhat have you. Somewhere, the two meet, creating a personality profile that is more explicitly racist,\n\nHauser Chapter 3.

Iam currently on a plane. I sent you earlier from the plane an email response to your letter, which\nIT hope you received. Regarding your note below: My earlier remark to you was based on my correspondence\n\nwith the universities during and after the investigation, and the conclusion I drew from the ANU report, which I\nquoted for you in my response to your note. The claims made in the allegation which were later demonstrated to\nbe false, or which were then not supported after repeated requests from the University to substantiate the claim,\n\nprovided evidence that the claim was fabricated (as I knew it must be), and therefore maliciously so.\n\nI had been planning on resigning my honorary appointment at ANU before I received the original letter from\nANU because my wife had moved to the US several years ago, and I no longer visited the University regularly\nto work with colleagues there as I did in earlier years. When I received the letter from ANU regarding the\ncomplaint, I decided to wait to resign my appointment until the investigation was completed and the complaint\nwas dismissed. After it was, I sent my note of resignation in, and I note that upon its receipt the Dean he\nsuggested I remain on until my appointment expired at the end of this year, but as I had made my decision to\nresign earlier I felt no need to wait until then. I received a very nice note from the director of the unit I work\nwith (who was made aware of the complaint and its resolution by the Dean) who expressed thanks for my many\ncontributions to the University while there, and my interactions with staff, students, and faculty there.\n\nI hope this clarifies your issues.\n\nLMK\n\nOn Dec 11, 2017, at 9:02 AM, Peter Aldhous ( wrote:\n\nDr. Krauss,\nSince sending the note below, we have heard from the Australian National University.

His message was among the simplest and most\ncompact and personal possible: The transmission of faith requires nothing more and\nnothing less than faith itself. Romans teaches us that believing in God, which is faith,\nis enough for access to all the riches of heaven: God’s righteousness, an afterlife,\nforgiveness.\n\nBy Luther’s age, however, access to those riches was not so simple. Among other\nthings, spiritual control had become a source of lucre for the church. The glory of the\nCatholic Church, her magnificent cathedrals and clothes, and her insidious habits of\nselling passes to heaven in the form of indulgences - this was a deployment of faith\nand power marked by a venality that grated against Luther’s from-faith-to-faith\nsensibility. When he saw his own congregation increasingly slipping away to\nchurches with priests who would do what he would not, which was to market and\nsell indulgences, he saw a rank, strange hypocrisy: The Church as an economic\ninstrument. His rage boiled over in the summer of 1517, and he summarized his\ncase against the Church in the 95 Theses that he nailed to the door of his local\nchurch on October 31s\". Papa non vult nec potest ullas penas remittere preter eas,\nquas arbitrio vel suo vel canonum imposuit, he wrote in Thesis Five: No matter what\nyou might pay him, the Pope can’t influence what happens to you after you die. Or,\nThesis 78, Euangelici rhetia sunt, quibus olim piscabantur viros divitiarum.\nIndulgences are nets with which one fishes for the riches of men.\n\nAs much as Luther was crying for a restoration of Saint Paul’s sense of a personal\nfaith, he was also starting a difficult and - for the Church - unpleasant argument\nabout power. Our relation to God, Luther meant, is our relation. It’s not something to\nbe brokered or sold or negotiated. It does not require fancy clothes or cathedrals or\nhierarchies. For Luther, this new logic had engendered a profound spiritual crisis.\nHe recalled, later in life, the very first time he’d encountered the possibility of direct\naccess to God, in the pages of Saint Augustine, probably around 1508. “When I came\nto the words ‘thee, most merciful father,” he wrote, “the thought that I had to speak\nto God without a mediator almost made me flee.”?! Who was he, Martin Luther, to\nspeak directly to God? But from then on, Luther’s experience of God, his own sense\nof power honestly passing from faith to faith - and not from faith to church to faith -\nembodied an extremely heretical idea about power: faith without a middleman.\n\nSuch a concept undid much of what had been taken as inarguable doctrine. The\nChurch immediately understood the danger. They rushed to label Luther as heretical\nand, later, crazy. In arguing that the Catholic Church, with all of its magnificent\ntrappings of faith, was really a useless toll gate, Luther was picking at a still larger,\nmore significant question: How should power be split? If Luther was right, and God\nshould be accessible directly to each of us, then some other questions tumbled after\nthat one. Should we have direct access to political power? To ideas? To money and\nland and control of our own economic destiny? Could “from faith to faith,” be recast\nas “from idea to idea” or “truth to truth” or - and this turned out to be the really\n\n91 “When I came to the words”: Preserved Smith, The Life and Letters of Martin\nLuther, (Boston: Houghton Mifflin, 1911) Introduction\n\n67\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_018299\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

The rest\nwere run of the mill criminal cases—murder, robbery, rape, assault and other street crimes. It\nwas a perfect combination for a budding law professor who was interested in constitutional and\ncriminal law.\n\nOur task began with a case record, which consisted of the appellate briefs filed by the lawyers and\nan “appendix,” which included relevant excerpts from the trial transcript and motions filed before\nthe trial court. Some records were relatively short, perhaps 300 pages in total. Others were\nhumongous, as many as 5,000 pages. Then there was the complete trial transcript—a verbatim\naccount of every word spoken during the trial, as well as during the pretrial and post-trial\nproceedings. Judge Bazelon would often ask me to read the entire transcript in search of errors\nor particular issues that were of interest to him.\n\nWhen we completed the review, we would discuss the case with the judge, who had read the\nbriefs and perused the appendix in preparation for the oral argument in court. Occasionally, we\nwere permitted to listen to the oral argument, especially when leading lawyers were arguing\n(which was rare), or when issues close to the judge’s heart were being considered. But generally,\nwe were required to remain in the chambers working while the judge presided over the oral\nargument.\n\nSince Bazelon was the Chief Judge, he always presided and got to assign the opinion to one of the\nthree judges on a panel (or nine when on rare occasions the entire court heard the case “en\nbanc”). Following the oral argument, there was a conference among the judges during which a\ntentative result was reached and the case assigned. Bazelon always assigned the most interesting\ncases to himself, or to a judge whose decisions he wanted to influence.\n\nWhen the conference was over and the case assigned, we would meet with the judge and he\nwould tell us which clerk was to work on the opinion. I always got the interesting cases (at least\nthe ones that interested the judge). My co-clerk, who the judge didn’t much like, got the dregs.\nThis was fine with him, since he didn’t much like working closely with the judge.\n\nThen the real work would begin. Draft after draft was submitted, marked up by the judge and\nrejected with the admonition, “You can do better,” or sometimes “start over, this draft isn’t\nright.”\n\nAfter many drafts, and some pressure from the other judges on the panel, the opinion was\nreleased to the public. Generally, they were majority opinions, often unanimous, but frequently\nthey were dissenting or concurring opinions. This was a deeply divided court and the dissenting\nopinions pulled no punches in criticizing the majority, and vice versa.\n\nAt the end of the year, the clerks would prepare bound volumes of all the opinions we worked on\nduring our clerkship. One was given to the judge and the others to us, as mementoes of our year.\nAs I write these words, I have in front of me the maroon volume engraved with the following\n\nwords:\n\n“Chief Judge David L.

In fact, France’s revolutionary age was only just beginning.\nThe fall of the Bastille was 18 months away; the flight and death of the King five\nyears off. Paris would soon see a time when one riot a year felt like peace. You can’t\nmiss in Jefferson’s letter, and in the others he exchanged with Madison that winter\nand the following spring, his instinct that the world was changing, that it was being\nriven by urgent new forces, and that America must be positioned for the fresh order\nboth internally and in her foreign policy. Jefferson knows what this new age\ndemands - liberty - and in that spirit he fires off suggestions for Madison. It is in this\nDecember, 1787 letter that he remarks that he “does not like” the absence of a “bill\nof rights”, a hint that led to an adjustment of historic import.\n\nIt is possible to regard the transformations of politics, economics and military affairs\nover the past centuries, the sorts of bold remakings that tore apart places like the\nBastille or built up instruments like the American Constitution, as emerging froma\nfew crucial periods, the sorts of historic turns that mark moments when power\nmakes an epochal shift. It is striking how, in passing through these periods of\nunthinkable change, America has benefited so much, so fully. The country was, to\nbegin with, born out of the social and political revolutions of the 18\" century. The\nnational liberation that pulled Jefferson from his Virginia farm and into politics was\nthe first of the great, revolutionary movements that convulsed and fractured a\ndozen European powers. France followed America, as did Germany and Italy and\nsoon most of the continent. “The boisterious sea of liberty,” Jefferson called the new\npolitical order*. It required a strong stomach. Tempests of accumulated social\npressures - the Reformation, the Enlightenment, the Scientific Revolution - had\npassed over one ancien regieme after another like powerful waves. America, begun\non fresh land and with new ideas inked onto clean paper, had a natural advantage in\nthe situation of her birth. “I think our government,” Jefferson concluded in his letter\nto Madison, “will remain virtuous for many centuries.”\n\nA second transformation of global order began in the middle of the 19 Century, as\nJefferson and Madison's age ended. Their period had largely been one of internal\nrevolutions, as the nations of Europe realigned their domestic orders. What came\nnext were furious contests between these countries. We might think of this new\nperiod as starting with the Franco-Prussian war of 1870 and as running, with\nincreasing violence, through to the summer of 1945 and the end of World War Two.\nIn this era, Europe’s statesmen struggled from one tragically collapsed balance to\nanother.

The freeze would not be open-\nended, but last for 10 months, as a way of boosting the effort to restart\nnegotiations. It would apply to new construction, not work already underway. And\nit would exclude the post-1967 neighborhoods inside the expanded city limits of\nJerusalem. Like his other moves, it was also dismissed as insignificant by the\nPalestinians. Though there was a formal restarting of the talks, they went almost\nnowhere during the period of the freeze, which Bibi cited as a reason for not\nextending it further. From then on, the negotiations produced even less. I didn’t\nbuy the narrative that this was entirely Bibi’s fault. Abu Mazen remained\nsteadfastly, deliberately passive. Obviously not inclined to take the risk of further\nwidening his rift with Hamas in Gaza, he was content to echo the Obama\nadministration’s argument that nothing could happen until there was a settlement\nfreeze. Once the freeze was announced, he went through the motions, avoiding all\nthe difficult issues, in the expectation Washington would ensure the freeze was\nrenewed. President Obama’s initial Mideast moves had made it much easier for\nAbu Mazen to avoid any serious engagement. In contrast to past presidents, Obama\nhad placed almost all of the onus for progress on Israel. But the end result also\nsuited Bibi. Though I never entirely gave up hope of persuading him it was in\nIsrael’s interest to seek a resolution of our conflict with the Palestinians, it became\nmore evident as the months went on that his aim was simply to keep things ticking\nover, and avoid any major new crisis.\n\nHe appointed an old personal friend — a corporate lawyer named Yitzhak\nMolcho — as our negotiator. I finally realized how pointless the exercise was when,\nduring a visit to the United States, I found myself in New York at the same time as\nMolcho. We met at the Israeli consulate. We spoke in detail about the state of the\nnegotiations. With Molcho still in the room, I phoned Bibi in Jerusalem on the\nsecure phone line. I said I’d just been updated on the talks, and it seemed clear\nthere were a number of suggestions Israel could make, with no domestic political\nrisk but with every prospect of improving the atmosphere and accelerating\nprogress. “Yitzhak is one of Israel’s top lawyers,” I said. “He’s struck dozens of\ndeals in his life. But he strikes a deal when that’s what his client wants. You are the\nclient. If you tell him: bring me back the best deal you can — not a peace treaty, just\na deal on a specific issue — he’ Il do it. But if his brief is simply to negotiate, he can\ngo on negotiating forever. And it’s pretty clear me that’s his brief.” Bibi insisted I\nwas wrong. He said that what I saw as time-wasting was simple prudence, to make\nsure the negotiations bore fruit.

My\nmaternal alarm bells went off straight away and I already knew my\nanswer. No way I could I do that to any poor baby, God only knew what\nthese monsters had in store for me let alone a baby, but it was an instant\nreaction that saved me. “I don’t know guy’s, | mean I’m really young\nand never really even thought about having kids yet. Wow, I just don’t\nknow.” I slicked my hand through my hair nervously and took in a silent\nbreath. [ had to go beyond what I was truly feeling and give them the\nfeeling that I’d never let them down. Putting an eager smile on my face\nand sucking up my gut’s intuition I told them “You know what, let me get\nmy certificates in massage and have some time to prepare for this and get\nhealthy then next year we’ll all think about having a baby together.” It\nwas crazy to even hear me say out loud but from the expressions on their\nfaces I had fulfilled their wishes.\n\nMuch reason to celebrate that night they were both in a cheery mood\naround the dinner table. Except for me who had taken double the dosage\nof Xanax to even cope with the high amounts of anxiety I had been\nsuffering from since we got back from the dock. I wasn’t sipping the\nchampagne that night, I was gulping it and when their moods tumed from\ncheery to raunchy later that evening it wasn’t hard for me to comply.\nFrom the full effects of the state I was in I would’ve agreed to just about\nanything, allowing them to treat themselves to ravishing the tender parts\nof my body.\n\nOver the next few weeks everything went on as it normally would, and\nnot another mention of their proposal. My birthday was only a week away\nand I was turning nineteen that year. All ] wanted was to get my\ncertificates before I got any older and get trapped into this life for good.\nWhen my big day rolled around I was in New York with Jeffrey and\nGhislane. Sitting on my bed listening to MTV’s channel blare in the\nbackground of my room I was painting my toenails when I was suddenly\nbuzzed on the intercom. It was Jeffrey calling himself to ask me to meet\nhim in his office in ten minutes. Perfect timing to let my nails dry I\nthought to myself. Already contemplating his desire to come downstairs I\nknew it had something to do with my birthday present but I was more\nexpecting the usual shopping money or piece of jewelry, definitely not\nwhat he had in store for me.\n\nI knocked on the slightly ajar door to Jeffrey’s office and heard him\nbeckon me inside. “Hello, what cha up too?” I asked in a cutesy tone of\nvoice. Walking over to his desk he looked up at me taking his reading\n\n115\n\n©] Copyright Protected Material\nCONFIDENTIAL GIUFFRE004248\n\nglasses off while granting me a big smile. “Come over here and sit down\nwith me” as he ushered me to come sit on his lap. Pulling me onto him he\nhad a funny look on his face, like he had something really big to tell me\nand was letting the anticipation build in the thickness of the silence.\n“What???” I laughed at the way he was looking at me now. “First of\nall.:. Happy birthday today.” Was only the beginning of his\nannouncement and he proceeded to tell me “I know how much you have\nwanted this for so long and you are more than deserving of it. You are\ngoing away to Thailand to learn authentic Thai Massage and within eight\nweeks you'll receive a certificate for being a qualified Thai Massage\nTherapist.” Astonished at his attempts to see me get what 1 wanted, not\nexactly the type of massage I was interested in but it was a start and a\nfirst certificate for me to acquire. My eyes lit up and I threw my arms\naround his neck, planting a big kiss on his lips, which I rarely ever did.\n“Wow, I don’t know what to say, this is beyond my wildest\ndreams...thank you so much!” I did well to let him know I appreciated\nhis grandeur offer. He went on to give me the details of where I’d be\nstaying, the school’s schedules, and how much he loved Thai massage,\napparently it was the next big thing to hit the shores of America. He had\nplanned out an entire itinerary for me. I was to depart at the end of\nAugust and he had already enrolled me in a class at “ITM Massage\nSchool”. I would only have a few days to settle in before I would be\nattending classes five days a week over eight hours a day. He even had an\nassignment for me to do while I was over there. | was to meet up with a\ngirl who was also being put up at the “Princess Hotel” where | was\nstaying. She had an Asian sounding name so I just assumed she was a\nlocal girl hoping for an opportunity of a lifetime, if she only knew what\nshe would be getting herself into. If 1 decided that she met Jeffrey’s\nparticular quota of approval then she would be sent over to the U.S to\nmeet with him or one of his esteemed colleagues. Besides the guilt of\nhaving to decide a stranger’s uncertain fate, everything else sounded\nmore than wonderful. Eight weeks gone from Jeffrey sounded like a\nlifetime away and I couldn’t be more excited at this chance. It was the\nopportunity of my lifetime and I wasn’t going to waste a second of it.\nGhislane came in a few minutes later and the look on her face told me\nshe already knew. I got up from Jeffrey’s lap and gave her a big hug and\ntold her, “This is so nice of you guys, Thank you so much!” She didn’t\nshare my enthusiasm of excitement. In a dull tone she responded, “I\ndidn’t have a thing to do with it, it was all Jeffrey’s idea but good-luck\nanyways.” She gave me her best impression of being human for a brief\nsecond and hugged me back. It was just her way and I had come to accept\nit. Depending on the level of slander her insults provoked was just her\nway of telling you she cares without really ever showing it.

I was\nespecially surprised given that your letter arrived on only the second day back to work after the\nThanksgiving Holiday, and yet your demands regarding timing suggest that I have been sitting on\nmy hands for days.\n\nYou should know that the first time I learned about Judge Davis’s selection of Podhurst\nand Josephsberg, and indeed the first time I ever heard their names, was in our meeting with you\non Wednesday of last week. Nevertheless, I have now been able to confer with my client, and we\nhave determined that the selection of Podhurst and Josephsberg are acceptable to us, reserving, of\ncourse, our previously stated objections to the manner in which you have interpreted the section\n2255 portions of the Agreement.\n\nWe do, however, strongly and emphatically object to your sending a letter to the alleged\nvictims. Without a fair opportunity to review and the ability to make objections to this letter, it is\ncompletely unacceptable that you would send it without our consideration. Additionally, given\nthat the US Attorney’s office has made clear it cannot vouch for the claims of the victims, it\nwould be incendiary and inappropriate for your Office to send such a letter. Indeed, because it is\na certainty that any such letter would immediately be leaked to the press, your actions will only\nhave the effect of injuring Mr. Epstein and promoting spurious civil litigation directed at him.\nWe believe it is entirely unprecedented, and in any event, inappropriate for the Government to be\nthe instigator of such lawsuits.\n\nFinally, we disagree with your view that you are required to notify the alleged victims\npursuant to the Justice for All Act of 2004. First, 18 USC section 2255, the relevant statute\nunder the Non-Prosecution Agreement for the settlement of civil remedies, does not have any\nconnection to the Justice for All Act. Section 2255 was enacted as part of a different statute.\nSecond, the Justice for All Act refers to restitution, and section 2255 is not a restitution statute.\nIt is a civil remedy. As you know, we had offered to provide a restitution fund for the alleged .\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_012676\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

You would not be \nable to do a competing book or documentary before then. This is not to say that they shouldn't be pursued. In \na sense, better that they know what Patterson's position is and, a year from now say, be able to counter it. I \nhave some thoughts on book and doc to share at your convenience. \nThat being said, you do need an immediate counter narrative to the book. I believe Trump offers an ideal \nopportunity. It's a chance to make the story about something other than you, while, at the same time, letting \nyou frame your own story. Also, becoming an anti-Trump voice gives you a certain political cover which you \ndecidedly don't have now. Still, this necessary involves you going public. And so the most basic decision is \nabout your willingness to do that. My view is that in a couple of weeks you could master message and \ntechnical proficiency. I know a bunch of people who could be very helpful here. This would involve something \nalong the lines of you writing an op-ed, doing a high profile television interview (Charlie Rose, I'd say), and \nperhaps some social media efforts. \nSpeaking of which, again, I think a strategic plan, involving your public identity, philanthropic activities and \ninterests, and the development of media allies, ought finally to be put in place. A big, comprehensive, \nexpensive effort. \nThe alternative is to continue to keep head down and hope Patterson book is just more he-said she-said and \nConnolly getting lost in the reeds (which, as an inveterate conspiracist, he always does). My worry is that \nPatterson can be counted on to produce a bestseller, and while he isn't regarded as a serious writer, he'll \nsurely be unloading a lot of tabloid copy. Because this will be tied to the election, the Trump-Clinton angle will \namp up the attention 10-fold, in fact, possibly, a hundred fold. Possibly more than anything you've \nencountered before. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 033589 \nMeanwhile--\nIn a lawyer's letter, I'd suggest including the following points--not necessarily legal, but a warning about how a \npress campaign might unfold (publishers are more worried about being caught in negative media controversy \nthan they are of legal threats): \n1) Little, Brown has made on the record representations to at least one well-known journalist that it was not \npublishing a book by James Patterson about Jeffrey Epstein--possibly an effort to avoid inquiries about the \nquestionable nature of the book; \n2) The actual author of the book, John Connolly, is someone other than the stated author, James Patterson. \nConnolly is known to have developed an obsession with Epstein, such that, his longtime employer, Vanity Fair, \nhas refused to allow him to write about Epstein for the magazine; \n3) Sources have confirmed for us that Patterson has had little more than a minimal consulting role in the book, \nand that Connolly has functioned in every material way as the book's researcher and writer. We believe \nPatterson's \"authorship\" of the book will not stand up to scrutiny. And, indeed, that the entire notion of an \nextension of the Patterson franchise into nonfiction, as it has been used in fiction and children's book--\neffectively other authors writing under the Patterson name—presents a host of journalism ethical issues. \nplease note \nThe information contained in this communication is \nconfidential, may be attorney-client privileged, may \nconstitute inside information, and is intended only for \nthe use of the addressee.

The researchers at-\ntempted to assess the combined impact\nof many different kinds of trials using\nmeta-analysis, a statistical technique for\nextracting information from studies that\nare not statistically significant by them-\nselves. Their article, “Is the Placebo Pow-\nerless? An Analysis of Clinical Trials\nComparing Placebo with No Treat-\nment,” published in The New England\nJournal of Medicine, was a long-overdue\nresponse to Beecher’s 1955 paper.\n\nIn almost every case, the researchers re-\nported, there was essentially no difference\nbetween the placebo group and the openly\nuntreated group. There were particular ex-\nceptions in studies of pain, where there\nwas a slight but measurable placebo effect.\nSince we are physiologically capable of\nmanufacturing our own painkillers—en-\ndorphins—the result may not have been\nsurprising. Expectations and suggestion\nclearly influence behavior, and when we\nexpect to receive medicine our bodies\noften begin to prepare for it. (As the evo-\nlutionary biologist Robert Trivers recently\npointed out, in “The Folly of Fools,” his\nbook about the historical necessity of de-\nceit, what the brain expects to happen in\nthe near future affects its physiological\nstate. Trivers’s theory would explain a fact\nthat has often baffled scientists: the pla-\ncebo effect doesn’t appear to work with\nAlzheimer’s patients. Trivers suggests that\nthis is because most people who have Al-\nzheimer’s disease are unable to anticipate\nthe future and are therefore unable to pre-\npare for it.)\n\nThe Danish researchers repeated the\nstudy in 2004, and again last year, incor-\nporating new data each time. The re-\nsults and their conclusions remained\nthe same. “We found little evidence in\ngeneral that placebos had powerful clin-\nical effects,” Hrdbjartsson wrote. “Out-\nside the setting of clinical trials, there is\nno justification for the use of placebos.”\n\nKaptchuk has great respect for Hré-\nbjartsson, yet he is wary of relying on\nmeta-analyses, and he believes that an\nhonest interaction between a doctor and\na patient can significantly alter the out-\ncome of treatment. That was the point of\nhis study of irritable-bowel syndrome, in\nwhich some subjects were told that they\nwould not be treated. I.B.S., a chronic\ngastrointestinal disorder, is one of the\nmost common reasons that people seek\n\nmedical care. Effective long-term thera-\npies have proved elusive. In Kaptchuk’s\nstudy, eighty patients were randomly di-\nvided into two groups. Patients in the first\ngroup received a placebo pill twice a day;\nthose in the second received nothing. Be-\nfore the study began, both groups were\ntold that placebos were “inert or inactive\npills, like sugar pills, without any medica-\ntion in them.” They were also informed\nthat placebos have been shown in “rigor-\nous clinical testing to produce significant\nmind-body self-healing processes.” Pa-\ntients who received the openly distributed\nplacebo scored far better on standard as-\nsessments of their condition than those\nwho received nothing. There were also\nstatistically significant differences in the\nseverity of symptoms.\n\nAlthough a group of eighty patients is\ntoo small to draw definitive conclusions,\nhonesty seemed to work. “Asbjorn’s stuff\nis a constant intellectual challenge,” Kapt-\nchuk wrote in an e-mail. “His meta-anal-\nyses are tops. Great methods, very careful.\nClear.” Yet Kaptchuk also pointed out\nthat placebos are not the only interven-\ntions that can cause complicated reac-\ntions. Drugs do, too. Opiods, for exam-\nple, increase pain in about ten per cent of\nthose who take them. Antibiotics don’t al-\nways work, and neither does cortisone, a\npowerful steroid used each year by mil-\nlions of people. Meta-analyses are useful\nto help understand large amounts of data\nfrom different trials. But statistical results\nthat combine information from a\nvariety of medical centers, with\ndifferent kinds of patients, often\nin different countries, adminis-\ntered under different conditions,\ncannot be uniform and therefore\ncannot be conclusive.\n\nHrébjartsson and Kaptchuk\nare united on at least one front.\nLike Wayne Jonas, they agree\nthat the medical system needs to\nchange. “You have to put this into\nthe context of the society in which\nyou live,” Hrébjartsson told me. “Because\nI think this may be as much a matter of\nphilosophy as of science. There is an anti-\ntechnological, anti-science feeling in the\nWest. We constantly see frustration with\nthe limits of medicine. The placebo can be\nseen in some sense as a logical avenue for\nthose frustrations. Everyone wants a sim-\nple, pain-free solution. But I wonder if that\napproach isn’t just the mirror image of the\n\npharmacological way of handling illness—\nthat there is a pill for every disease.\n\n“The entire idea of a placebo is very\n‘soapy, ” Hrébjartsson continued. “It slips\naway whenever you try to find a border.”\n\nThat has always been true. After all, for\nmany people a placebo is just a sugar pill.\nFor others, the definition includes the en-\ntire ritual of treatment, the complete inter-\naction between doctor and patient. In-\ncreased attention has mostly raised new\nquestions: What are the physical and psy-\nchological mechanisms that produce pla-\ncebo effects? What are the conditions they\nmost easily affect? And can we actually\nidentify people who respond to placebos?\nScientists now have bits of answers to some\nof those questions, but to reach their goal,\nand introduce placebos into clinical prac-\ntice, they will need to answer all of them.\n\nT Kaptchuk gets a great deal of\npleasure from focussing on what\nother people reject. Indifference seems to\nmotivate him. “I was raised in a crazy\nhome, and it prepared me to accept any\nproposition,” he said. That, he once told\nme, is why he was so active in the sixties:\n“Tt was a time when the underpinnings of\nthe universe were questioned.” Both of\nKaptchuk’s parents, who were Poles, sur-\nvived the Holocaust. “That really defines\na lot of what I do. My father was a Red,\nso I have a tendency to get pleasure from\nsubversiveness.”\n\nA particularly radical son of the six-\nties, Kaptchuk was one of the\nfounders of the Columbia Uni-\nversity chapter of Students for\na Democratic Society, in 1965,\nbut the organization was soon\ndominated by a faction that be-\ncame the Weather Under-\nground. That was too radical\neven for Kaptchuk. He fled to\nthe West Coast. “I was hanging\nout with the San Francisco Red\nGuards and reading Mao, trying\nto get away from U.S. imperial-\nism,” he said. “I was militant and crazy.\nBut at some point I said, Ted, this is not\nbeing human.”\n\nKaptchuk decided to pursue studies in\nChinese philosophy and medicine at the\nsource. Beijing had yet to open its bor-\nders to Americans, but Kaptchuk hoped\nthat his revolutionary bona fides would\nprompt the leadership to make an excep-\ntion. “My request to study there was de-\n\nTHE NEW YORKER, DECEMBER 12, 201 35\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_029930\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

But the internet in particular\nwas seen as an irresistible force that could render\ncensorship of any kind impossible. In 2000, President\nBill Clinton compared China's efforts to control inter-\nnet content to “trying to nail Jell-O to the wall.””\n\nThird, a growing number of experts began to identify\nanew instigator of democratic change in global civil\nsociety. Unlike the “peoples movements’ of earlier\ndecades, in which well-known leaders mobilized mass\ndemonstrations and often insurrectionary violence\nwith the goal of overthrowing despotic regimes, the\nphenomenon that was labeled civil society consisted\nof organizations that were often committed to a single\ncause or a few causes united by a particular theme.\nMost activists were young, with little prior involvement\nin politics, and many regarded themselves as part of\n\na global effort to advance goals like reducing carbon\nemissions, empowering women, or fighting corruption.\n\nIn a prescient 1997 article, Jessica T. Mathews predict-\ned that in the future global civil society would be the\ntriggering force behind liberal change.* She suggested\nthat in many cases civil society organizations would\nplay amore important role than governments. Her\nwords seemed prescient in light of later events in\nSerbia, where student activists organized a campaign\nthat eventually brought about the downfall of President\nSlobodan MiloSevicé in 2000, and in Ukraine, where\nyoung reformers played a pivotal role in ensuring that\nthe 2004 elections were not stolen through fraud.\n\nIn declaring that dictatorships or even authoritarian\nmethods were destined to succumb to this triad of\n\nnew social forces, commentators were also express-\ning optimism about the universal appeal of liberal\nvalues. The decade after the end of the Cold War\nwas a heyday for democratic ideas and norms. It was\nincreasingly expected that countries would not only\nhold elections, but that their elections would meet\ninternational standards and be judged “free and fair.”\nThere was also an expectation that political parties\nwould be able to compete on a reasonably level\nplaying field, that opposition leaders would not be\nharassed or arrested, and that minorities would be\nable to pursue their agendas through normal political\nchannels and not find it necessary to wage perpetual\nprotest campaigns.\n\nHowever, there were nagging questions. It remained\nunclear whether most societies would have access to\nmultiple sources of political ideas, multiple interpreta-\ntions of the news, and open scholarly inquiries about\nthe past. Would there be honest judicial proceedings,\nespecially in cases with political implications? Would\nproperty rights be secure?\n\nBeyond these primarily domestic issues, there was\nanother series of questions related to individual\ngovernments’ relations with their neighbors and the\nrest of the world. The end of the Cold War had brought\na peace dividend, both financial and psychological,\n\nfor all sides. At the time, most assumed that peace\nwould prove durable. But would the general decline\n\nin military budgets hold? Would the new national\nboundaries that divided the former Soviet Union and\nthe former Yugoslavia be sustainable?\n\nAs modern authoritarianism has taken root and ex-\npanded its influence, the answers to these questions\nare increasingly negative.\n\n1.

She certainly won mine. But I was not alone in wondering whether it\nwas worth the price that she, Kadima, and the country would pay as a result: Bibi’s\nreturn as Prime Minister in a Likud-led coalition.\n\nThough I was not surprised when he asked me to remain as Defense Minister,\nand to keep Labor inside the coalition, that was not an easy argument to make to\nmy reduced Knesset contingent. They saw joining Bibi, especially in a government\nwith the right-wing Lieberman as Foreign Minister, as a betrayal of all the efforts\nthat they and I had made to achieve peace with the Palestinians. Still, the decision\non whether to join the coalition ultimately rested with the party central committee,\nalmost every one of whose members was on a local government council. For them,\nthe choice was between a share of power, however limited, and the wilderness of\nopposition. So we joined Bibi’s government.\n\nI was personally in favor of our doing so, but for more complicated reasons. I\nknew that Bibi’s background, his instincts and his undeniably powerful political\nrhetoric were all firmly rooted on the political right. I recognized that he was often\nmore interested in politics than policy, and perhaps above both of those, in the\ntactical maneuvering required to consolidate his political position. But I had known\nhim long enough to dismiss the suggestions of many of my colleagues that he was\nintellectually shallow. I felt he was capable of doing what was best for Israel, and\nthat he had a basic pragmatism that would guide how he got there. All that,\nhowever, was just a reason for not saying “no” when he asked me and Labor to\nstay on. The reason I felt it was right to say yes had to two with specific policy\nchallenges. The first was to ensure there at least some peace process with the\nPalestinians. But that, in turn, was in large part because I believed it would win us\nthe diplomatic support, especially from the Americans, needed to tackle a more\nurgent threat. It again involved an enemy state trying to get nuclear weapons. But\nnot Syria. The Islamic theocracy of Iran.\n\nWe’d been aware for a number of years about Iranian efforts to go nuclear. The\nMossad had notched up a series of successes in delaying the Iranians from getting\nthere. But they were getting inexorably closer. In fact, when I’d taken over as\nDefense Minister under Olmert, I formally directed the new chief-of-staff, Gaby\nAshknazi, to get to work on a plan to attack the most important facilities in the\nIranians’ nuclear network, with the aim of pushing back the point at which they\nmight develop a bomb by five to six years.

L. Rev. 844, *902\n\nResponses to unjustified police violence reveal a third outcome for enforcement redundancy confined to the federalism model.\nFederal enforcement authority extends to cases of police violence to a much greater degree than for sexual assaults. That\nauthority extends as well to other kinds of bias-motivated wrongdoing by both private actors and government officials, which\nlocal police and prosecutors have at times ignored or devalued, and for which state-level enforcement commitment continues to\nbe uneven. !” Federal jurisdiction is coextensive with state jurisdiction regarding police wrongdoing, and the Justice\nDepartment's institutional capacity for enforcement probably exceeds that of its state counterparts, but in one respect the\noverlap is not complete. The key substantive criminal offenses available to prosecutors in the federal code are somewhat more\nrestrictive. The primary federal statute used to charge cases of [*903] police excessive use of force requires proof of willful\n\ndeprivation of rights, °°\n\na strict mens rea standard that makes it harder for federal prosecutors to prove liability than it would\nbe for state prosecutors relying on typical assault or homicide offense definitions. 7°! The fact that Congress has for decades\nlet stand this mens rea hurdle to excessive-force prosecutions suggests that federal legislators, if not Justice Department\nofficials, are less committed to a full federal-state enforcement redundancy - or \"to altering the federal-state balance in order to\nreinforce state law enforcement\" - than they are for public corruption offenses. 7°\n\nThat limit notwithstanding, federal prosecutions in this area have a track record of succeeding where state prosecutions failed\nor were never attempted, and in that way providing at least a partial remedy for underenforcement by state criminal justice\nofficials. Much of the federal advantage comes from the fact that federal prosecutors are, in general, better situated to\nobjectively investigate, assess, and prosecute wrongdoing by police officers than are local prosecutors who ordinarily interact\nwith and depend upon those officers (or at least their agencies). This is not a particular criticism of local prosecutors’ offices; it\nis one instance of the basic problem that officials (and people generally) are untrustworthy judges of the conduct of others with\nwhom they have affiliations, allegiances, or ongoing relationships. For that reason a few states assign such cases to state-level,\nrather than local, officials. 7° And the U.S. Justice Department attempts to collect data on deaths in jails, prison, or during\n[#904] attempted arrests, to facilitate Justice Department oversight. ?°4 The same concerns motivate English laws applying\nspecial judicial scrutiny (when triggered by requests from victims' families) to prosecutor's decisions not to charge in the case\n\nof death caused by law enforcement officials or occurring in official custody. 7°\n\n131 Some federal states such as Germany and Canada lack enforcement redundancy because they use a single, nationwide, criminal code,\nwhich is enforced for prosecution agencies and courts organized at the state or provincial level. See generally Eric P. Polten & Eric Glezl,\nFederalism in Canada and Germany: Overview and Comparison (2014) (describing similarities in German and Canadian federalism,\nincluding allocating authority over substantive criminal law to the federal government but criminal justice administration to state or\nprovincial prosecutors and courts). In Australia, like in the United States, states and the federal government each have their own criminal\ncodes. But Australian federal criminal authority is confined much more narrowly than in the United States to conduct that implicates a\ndistinct federal interest. See generally Arther B. Gunlicks, The Lander and German Federalism 59, 72, 129 (2003) (describing German\ncriminal affairs and jurisdictions as compared to the United States); Polten & Glezl, supra, at 5-6, 10, 13-14; Brian Galligan, Comparative\nFederalism, in The Oxford Handbook of Political Institutions 261, 266-75 (Sarah A. Binder et al. eds., 2008) (discussing federalism and\njudicial review and regulations); Kathleen Daly & Rick Sarre, Criminal Justice System: Aims and Processes, in Crime and Justice: A Guide\nto Criminology 357 (Darren Palmer et al. eds., 5th ed. 2017) (examining the processes and purposes of the criminal justice system); Vicki\nWaye & Paul Marcus, Australia and the United States: Two Common Criminal Justice Systems Uncommonly at Odds, Part 2, 78 Tul. J. Int'l\n& Comp. L. 335 (2010) (highlighting similarities and differences between the two countries in relation to criminal laws and policies).\n\n32 Since 2011, Switzerland also now has unified national criminal law and procedure codes administered in all cantons. See Anna Petrig,\nThe Expansion of Swiss Criminal Jurisdiction in Light of International Law, 9 Utrecht L. Rev. 34, 36 (2013).\n\n33 See Director of Public Prosecutions Act 1983 s 10(2); Annual Report 2014-15, supra note 71.\n\n34 Tn unusual circumstances, two states may also have concurrent jurisdiction over the same crime, enabling one to assess the adequacy of\nthe other's enforcement effort. For a rare example, see Heath v. Alabama, 474 U.S. 82, 91-93 (1985).\n\n35. See U.S. Const. amend. V (Double Jeopardy Clause); Bartkus v. Illinois, 359 U.S. 121, 136-39 (1959) (affirming power of state to\nprosecute defendant after a federal prosecution for the same bank robbery); United States v. Lanza, 260 U.S. 377, 384-85 (1922) (approving\nfederal prosecution after state prosecution based on same conduct).\n\nDAVID SCHOEN\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_016539\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

Crim. L. & Criminology 59, *93\n\nIn 2006, Epstein's acts of abuse came to the attention of the Palm Beach Police Department, which began investigating the case.\n195 At this point, once again, the victims would not have had rights under the proposed CVRA test. The CVRA extends rights in\nthe federal criminal justice process. A state investigation does not trigger the CVRA (although it may trigger certain state law\nprotections, as discussed below). !%°\n\nAt some point in 2006, the Palm Beach Police Department asked the FBI to investigate Epstein on federal sex offenses, such as\nusing a means of [*94] interstate communication in connection with sex offenses and traveling in interstate commerce for the\npurpose of engaging in illicit sexual conduct with minors. !97 The local police provided the FBI with information, which the\nFBI then investigated. Following an investigation, the FBI determined that the allegations of abuse against Epstein were\ncredible, and it presented the case to the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of Florida. In 2007, the Office\ncontacted counsel for Jeffrey Epstein and began negotiating a resolution of the case against him. 78\n\nUnder our proposed test, the victims would not have had CVRA rights the first moment that the FBI became aware of Epstein’s\npossible commission of sex offenses. But after the FBI developed substantial evidence of those sex offenses, identified victims\nof those offenses, and presented the case to the appropriate U.S. Attorney's Office for prosecution, CVRA rights would have\nattached. Accordingly, the FBI would have been required to notify the identified victims of their rights under the CVRA (as\nwell as under the VRRA). From that point forward in the case, the victims would have had CVRA rights, such as the right to\nfair treatment and the right to confer with prosecutors. In this case, the victims would have had the right to confer with\n\nprosecutors about the nonprosecution agreement that they ultimately reached with Epstein. 1°?\n\nC. CURRENT DEPARTMENT POLICY ON PRE-CHARGING RIGHTS\n\nOne objection that might be made to the formulation offered above is that it might unduly burden federal law enforcement\nofficers and prosecutors, who would need to make judgment calls about when an investigation has coalesced to the point where\n\"victims\" are in existence, \"substantial evidence\" has been collected, and notice of rights has to be provided. Any such\nobjection would be ill-founded, though, as it does not appear that implementing such an approach would be difficult. 7°\nPresumably the Justice Department has already been providing such rights in at least Texas, Louisiana, and Mississippi to\ncomply with the Fifth [*95] Circuit's 2008 ruling in In Re Dean, which held that the CVRA extends rights to victims before\n\ndefendants are charged. 7°! We have not seen any reports that providing the rights has been difficult.\n\nPerhaps the reason for the lack of any reported difficulty is that the Department's current policy on crime victims' rights already\nrequires notices to victims during investigations. The Justice Department has promulgated the Attorney General Guidelines for\nVictim and Witness Assistance, the latest edition of which is from May 2012. The Guidelines discuss crime victims’ rights\nunder both the CVRA and the earlier VRRA.

It concerns the experienced direction of time: Why is the past so different from the present and \nthe future? This difference is encapsulated in the expression the arrow of time. It is problematic because all the \nknown laws of nature have exactly the same form, whatever direction, in which time is supposed to flow. The \nBrockman, Inc. Frankfurt 2016 Hotlist \n-1-\nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 025147 \ntechnical expression for this is time-reversal symmetry. This basic property seems to be entirely at odds with the \npronounced unidirectionality of experienced time. In fact, there are several arrows. \n\"Until recent work by myself and my collaborators Tim Koslowski and Flavio Mercati, essentially only one \nproposal had been made—in well over a century—to explain why, despite the time-reversal symmetry of all the \nlaws of nature, these pronounced arrows of time exist, and always have existed, throughout the observable \nuniverse. As I explain in The Janus Point, this sole explanation is a manifest stop gap and satisfies no serious \nscientist. \n\"This has been dubbed the past hypothesis. However, it is not in any sense an explanation that follows from the \nstructure of the law and does not lead to any new prediction. It is an admission of defeat: Modern science fails to \nexplain the most profound aspects of our existence. \n\"The Janus Point is clearly timely because it is about a set of very simple ideas and insights that have the \npotential to solve one of the deepest and longest-standing problems in physics. Everyone is interested in time \nand its numerous puzzling aspects. Proof of that is the success of my earlier book The End of Time, which is still \nselling more than sixteen years after its publication. Some of the ideas conjectured in that book are, in fact, \nrealized in the model now proposed. \n\"For readers, The Janus Point tells the fascinating story of one of the greatest mysteries in science and what \nlooks to be its unexpected and, in principle, remarkably simple solution. More than most books in popular \nscience, its subject resonates profoundly with the reader. Nothing touches us more intimately than the drama of \nbirth, life and death.\" \nJULIAN BARBOUR, an independent researcher, is currently visiting professor at the University of Oxford. He \nhas devoted significant time and effort to issues that lie at the foundations of science, above all the nature of \ntime and motion. His first paper was published in Nature and attracted favorable editorial comment and most \nimportantly led to six years of very valuable collaboration with the well-known Italian theorist Bruno Bertotti. It \nculminated in 1982 with a joint paper in the Proceedings of the Royal Society of London, which is now regarded \nas a seminal paper on the interconnection of local dynamics with the universe at large. Barbour made a big \nimpact in the physics community with the publication of his book, The End of Time, in which, according to \nphysicist Lee Smolin, he presented \"a new theory of time that is the most interesting and provocative new idea \nabout time to be proposed in many years.\" \nAMERICAN KINGPIN \nThe Epic Hunt for the Criminal Mastermind Behind the Silk Road \nBy Nick Bilton \n[US — Portfolio, UK — Virgin Books, Audio — Penguin RH; Manuscript; 304 pages; Publication: May 2017] \nFrom New York Times-bestselling author Nick Bilton comes a true-life thriller about the rise and fall of Ross \nUlbricht, aka the Dread Pirate Roberts, the founder of the online black market Silk Road. \nIn American Kingpin Bilton turns his investigative journalism to the story of Ross Ulbricht, the notorious and \nenigmatic founder of a drug empire called Silk Road. This is a true-life thriller about ambition gone awry, \nspurred on by the defining clash of our time: the new world of libertarian-leaning, anonymous, decentralized \nweb advocates and the old world of government control, order, and the rule of law. Bilton's dazzling rendering \nand gift for narrative make for an endlessly fascinating drama. \nIn 2011, Ulbricht, a twenty-six-year-old libertarian idealist and former Boy Scout, launched \"a website where \npeople could buy anything anonymously, with no trail whatsoever that could lead back to them.\" He called it \nSilk Road, opened for business on the Dark Web, and christened himself the Dread Pirate Roberts (after the \nBrockman, Inc. Frankfurt 2016 Hotlist \n-2-\nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 025148 \nPrincess Bride character). The site grew at a tremendous pace, quickly becoming a $1.2 billion enterprise where \nyou could buy or sell drugs, hacking software, forged passports, counterfeit cash, guns, grenades, and poisons. \nThe Silk Road soon caught the attention of the Feds, who embarked on an epic two-year manhunt for the site's \nproprietor. Ulbricht, in the meantime, struggled to maintain control of his double life and his marketplace, which \nhe originally started to prove that legalizing drugs could make society safer. He gradually abandoned his \nlibertarian ideals to rule Silk Road with increasingly authoritarian force. At one point, he engaged the services of \nhired hit men to take out employees he felt had wronged him. Soon, some of the Federal agents who were \nsupposed to be hunting for Ulbricht were lured into the dark world and switched sides to join him. \nNICK BELTON is a special correspondent for Vanity Fair, where he writes about technology, business, and \nculture, and a contributor at CNBC.

Norton, China— Huazhang, Audio — Audible; Manuscript; Pub Date: April 2017; \n304 pages] \nPioneering neuroscientist Dean Buonomano examines how the brain tells time, predicts the future, and \nunderstands the past in a book that straddles the fields of physics, psychology and neuroscience. \nFew questions are as perplexing and profound as those that relate to time. Philosophers ponder what time is. \nPhysicists grapple with why time appears to be a one-way street, and debate whether it is a single lonely point or \na full-blown dimension. Neuroscientists and psychologists struggle to understand what it means to \"feel\" the \npassage of time and how the brain tells it. Time is also key to the question of free will: is the future an open \npath, or is it preordained by the past? \nThe brain, argues Buonomano, is at its core a time machine. It is the brain's ability to anticipate the actions of \nprey, predators, and mates, and to predict when events will occur in a dynamically changing world, that \nultimately translate into the evolutionary currency of survival and reproduction. \nThe ability of animals to predict the future culminated with Homo sapiens' capacity to grasp the concept of time. \nOnly then were we able to craft a blade for future use, or plant a seed to quench projected hunger. \nYour Brain is a Time Machine explains that, in the end, our intuitions and theories about time reveal as much \nabout the architecture and limitations of our brains as they do about the true nature of time. \nDEAN BUONOMANO is a professor in the Departments of Neurobiology and Psychology at UCLA, and an \ninvestigator in the Integrative Center for Learning and Memory. He is the author of Brain Bugs: How the Brain's \nFlaws Shape Our Lives, which was a Wall Street Journal bestseller, and his research has been highlighted in \nmany national and international magazines and newspapers, including Discover, Newsweek, Scientific American, \nZeit, Cosmos, Horzu Wissen, and the New Yorker. \nBrockman, Inc.

As much as his full length books such as The Selfish Gene, The Blind Watchmaker, and The God Delusion, \nhave changed our perceptions of both science and the world it opens, his essays and articles are potent, pithy, \nthought provoking and revealing windows into the world as he, himself, perceives it. Science in the Soul is a \ncollection of some of Dawkins' best writing: articles and lectures, reflections and polemics, reviews, forewords, \ntributes or eulogies, both published and unpublished. \nFrom the introduction, by Gillian Somerscales: \"Richard Dawkins has always defied categorization. One \neminent biologist of mathematical bent reviewing The Selfish Gene and The Extended Phenotype was startled to \nfind a scientific work apparently free of logical errors and yet containing not a single line of mathematics; he \ncould come to no other conclusion than that, incomprehensible as it seemed to him, 'Dawkins . . . apparently \nthinks in prose.' \n\"If readers of what follows here come to appreciate not only the writer's clarity of thought and facility of \nexpression, the fearlessness with which he confronts very large elephants in very small rooms, the energy with \nwhich he devotes himself to explication of the complex and the beautiful in science, but also some of the \ngenerosity, kindness and courtesy that have characterized all my dealings with Richard over the years since that \nfirst collaboration, then the present volume will have achieved one of its aims. \n\"It will have achieved another if it embodies a condition felicitously described in one of the essays reproduced \nhere, where 'harmonious parts flourish in the presence of each other, and the illusion of a harmonious whole \nemerges.'

This question fascinates people from poets and painters to \nphysicists, psychologists, and philosophers. From Bacteria to Bach and Back is Daniel C. Dennett's brilliant \nanswer, extending perspectives from his earlier work in surprising directions, exploring the deep interactions of \nevolution, brains, and human culture. \nPart philosophical whodunit, part bold scientific conjecture, this landmark work enlarges themes that have \nsustained Dennett's legendary career at the forefront of philosophical thought. In his inimitable style—laced \nBrockman, Inc. Frankfurt 2016 Hotlist \n-4-\nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 025150 \nwith wit and arresting thought experiments—Dennett shows how culture enables reflection by installing a \nbounty of thinking tools, or memes, in our brains. Language, itself composed of memes, turbocharged this \ninterplay. The result, a mind that can comprehend the questions it poses, emerges from a process of cultural \nevolution. \nAn agenda-setting book for a new generation of philosophers and other researchers, From Bacteria to Bach and \nBack will delight and entertain anyone who hopes to understand human creativity in all its wondrous \napplications. \nDANIEL C.

Doudna and Samuel H. Sternberg \n[US — Houghton Mifflin, UK — Bodley Head, China — Hunan Science, Audio — Audible; Manuscript; Pub \nDate: June 2017; 320 pages] \nIn the tradition of The Double Helix, A Crack in Creation is an insider's account of the biggest scientific \ndiscovery of our era: a cheap, easy way of rewriting genetic code, with nearly limitless promise and peril. \nNot since the atomic bomb has a technology so alarmed its inventors that they warned the world against its use. \nNot, that is, until the spring of 2015, when biologist Jennifer Doudna called for a worldwide moratorium on the \nuse of the new gene-editing tool CRISPR to make heritable changes in human embryos. The cheapest, simplest, \nmost effective way of manipulating DNA ever known, CRISPR may well give us the cure to HIV, genetic \ndiseases, and some cancers, and will help address the world's hunger crisis. Yet even the tiniest changes to DNA \ncould have myriad, unforeseeable consequences—to say nothing of the ethical and societal repercussions of \nintentionally mutating embryos to create \"better\" humans. \nWriting with fellow researcher Samuel Sternberg, Doudna shares the thrilling story of her discovery, and \npassionately argues that enormous responsibility comes with the ability to rewrite the code of life. With \nCRISPR, she shows, we have effectively taken control of evolution. What will we do with this unfathomable \npower? \nJENNIFER A.

Lieberman is well known for \nhis unique and unusually integrative approach to research, which combines paleontology, anatomy, physiology \nand experimental biomechanics. \n\"Endurance,\" Lieberman writes, \"argues that we need to rethink how we think about exercise using the dual \nlenses of anthropology and evolutionary biology. As the modern word 'exercise' itself implies, people today \ngenerally think of physical activity as a pastime or a form of medicine. Most of us spend the majority of the day \nsitting and then we briefly exercise in our spare time, sometimes for fun, but increasingly to ward off ill health. \nYet, until very recently, physical activity was a paradoxically fundamental part of being human: utterly \nnecessary but instinctively avoided. Put simply, we evolved to be reluctant endurance athletes. \n\"This legacy underlies and points to urgently needed solutions for today's exercise dilemma. Everyone knows \nthat exercise is vital for good health, yet the vast majority of Americans and others in the developed world are \nunable to exercise enough. Our species endured because we had no choice but to be athletes, and if we wish our \nhealth to endure as individuals, then we still need to make exercise indispensable today. Rather than thinking of \nexercise as a 'magic pill' for good health, it is the absence of physical activity, primarily endurance exercise, that \naccelerates aging and hastens death. Endurance points to a new way of understanding and solving this global \nproblem. \n\"Endurance is the product of a long journey, part intellectual, part physical. Over the last decade I have \ntraversed the globe to observe, often as a participant, how humans are physically active in different traditional \ncultures from Africa to Greenland to India. Among other experiences, I've run barefoot and carried water on my \nhead in Kenya, tracked muskoxen and kudu with indigenous hunters in Greenland and Tanzania, participated in \nthe ancient Tarahumara ballgame under the stars in Mexico, dug millet fields in Rwanda, played barefoot cricket \nin rural India, and raced on foot against horses in the mountains of Arizona. Back in my lab at Harvard, my \nstudents and I have intensively studied the evolution, biomechanics and physiology of key human physical \nactivities, including how we walk, run, throw, dig, climb and even chew. \n\"Endurance weaves together these experiences, perspectives and insights into the form of a highly personal \nnatural history of first rest, then strength, and finally endurance.\" \nDANIEL LIEBERMAN is a professor and chair of the Department of Human Evolutionary Biology at Harvard. \nA leader in the field of human evolutionary biology, Lieberman's research asks how and why evolution made the \nhuman body the way it is.

As E.O. Wilson writes, Losos is a \"world leader in \nresearch and theory of the overlapping fields of herpetology, biodiversity, and species formation.\" \n\"In the last few years,\" Losos writes, \"evolutionary biologists have come to realize that evolution can occur \nmuch more rapidly than Darwin and a century of subsequent biologists ever expected—fast enough, in fact, to \nobserve as it occurs, even during the span of a single research grant! Now that we know that evolution can \nproceed rapidly, experimental studies in natural systems have begun.\" \nLosos' work on lizards has been at the forefront of the experimental evolution movement. Using small \nBahamian islands as test tubes, he and his team have altered conditions and made predictions about how \npopulations should evolve in response. And the results are resoundingly consistent: evolution is extremely \npredictable. \nImprobable Destinies is not only about what we know about evolution, but how we know what we know.

We could only do a cursory explanation of the new reality on campus and how terms like 'trigger \nwarnings,' microaggressions,' and `disinvitations' suddenly rose from obscurity to become part of higher \neducation's and the nation's vocabulary. A full-length book allows us to cover a host of new hot topics, including \nso-called 'safe spaces' and how a warped idea of safety is used to justify campus censorship, as well as campus \n'bias response teams' (BRTs)—Orwellian programs that police the language students use in their private lives \nBrockman, Inc.

It is worth noting that this past spring a professor was actually investigated \nby one of these BRTs for assigning CAM as class reading! \n\"Second, since the article was published, the situation on campus has only worsened. Within a few months after \nthe article's release, student demands for censorship had broken out across the country. \n\"Third, and possibly most importantly, we want to reactivate and deepen the discussion that we started in CAM \nabout the science of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) as a useful lens for looking at any number of modern \nproblems. CBT is a remarkably simple, successful treatment that helps patients overcome their anxiety and \ndepression by teaching them how to identify and combat 'cognitive distortions,' the wild mental exaggerations \nin which the anxious and depressed overindulge. To our knowledge, CAM was the first and only major article to \npropose that we should not only use CBT to examine our own inner thoughts, but also the world around us. \n\"The issue of free speech on campus is extremely hot, and will continue to be for years to come, but virtually no \none besides us is offering a solution that gets to the heart of the problem and can actually help students rather \nthan simply ridiculing them. \n\"Regarding the market, when CAM came out, it seemed that this was a uniquely American problem. But just in \nthe last year, it has spread throughout the UK, and is beginning to appear in Australia. In fact, there has been \nmajor interest in CAM in the UK and European countries. In Europe, I was recently interviewed by \nSiiddeutsche Zeitung, Germany's biggest daily newspaper, and Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung also ran a major \narticle.

Prum \n[US — Doubleday, Audio — Penguin RH; Manuscript; Pub Date: May 2017; 480 pages] \nA major reimagining of how evolutionary forces work, revealing how mating preferences—what Darwin termed \n\"the taste for the beautiful\" —create the extraordinary range of ornament in the animal world. \nIn the great halls of science, dogma holds that Darwin's theory of natural selection explains every branch on the \ntree of life: which species thrive, which wither away to extinction, and what features each evolves. But can \nadaptation by natural selection really account for everything we see in nature? \nYale University ornithologist Richard Prum —reviving Darwin's own views—thinks not. Deep in tropical \njungles around the world are birds with a dizzying array of appearances and mating displays: Club-winged \nManakins who sing with their wings, Great Argus Pheasants who dazzle prospective mates with a four-foot-\nwide cone of feathers covered in golden 3D spheres, Red-capped Manakins who moonwalk. In thirty years of \nfieldwork, Prum has seen numerous display traits that seem disconnected from, if not outright contrary to, \nselection for individual survival. To explain this, he dusts off Darwin's long-neglected theory of sexual selection \nin which the act of choosing a mate for purely aesthetic reasons—for the mere pleasure of it—is an independent \nengine of evolutionary change. \nMate choice can drive ornamental traits from the constraints of adaptive evolution, allowing them to grow ever \nmore elaborate. It also sets the stakes for sexual conflict, in which the sexual autonomy of the female evolves in \nresponse to male sexual control. Most crucially, this framework provides important insights into the evolution of \nhuman sexuality, particularly the ways in which female preferences have changed male bodies, and even \nmaleness itself, through evolutionary time. \nThe Evolution of Beauty presents a unique scientific vision for how nature's splendor contributes to a more \ncomplete understanding of evolution and of ourselves. \nRICHARD 0. PRUM is the William Robertson Coe Professor of Ornithology at Yale University. A lifelong bird \nfanatic, Prum has published more than 100 scientific articles on diverse topics including the evolution, behavior, \nsong, anatomy, developmental biology, phylogenetics, paleontology, optical physics, and pigmentary chemistry \nof birds. He has made ground-breaking scientific contributions to our understanding the evolutionary origin of \nfeathers, the physics of structural coloration, dinosaur feathers, fossil coloration, and the phylogenetic evolution \nof behavior. Over the past thirty years, Prum has developed a unique scientific perspective on evolution, and he \nhas documented this view with major scientific discoveries. \nBrockman, Inc.

Ramachandran, author most recently of The Tell-Tale Brain. \n\"The Interactive Brain,\" writes Ramachandran, \"is a tour of some of the most cherished yet elusive qualities of \nour minds. The book argues that recent advances in neurosciences have contributed to a revolutionary new \nmodel of the brain, in which brain function is controlled, not by highly specialized, hierarchical modules, mainly \nhard-wired, as once thought, but rather by highly interactive modules that can shift their roles in a matter of days \nor even hours The implications are not merely theoretical but have practical applications in medicine, offering \nsolutions for everyone from stroke patients to those with obsessive compulsive disorder. \n\"There are many neurological syndromes I'll discuss throughout the book. For example, a patient who was \notherwise smart and level-headed but kept insisting that his reflection in the mirror was the 'real David,' and that \nthe David viewing the mirror was a clone. He wiped off a tear from his eye and asked 'Dad, if the real David \nreturns will you disown me?' Even the axiomatic foundation of our selfhood—the notion that I'm a single \nperson in one body—is called into question when we encounter patients like him. \n\"Not only can we change our own brains, but we can change the brains of others because of the implications of \nmirror neurons. The Interactive Brain incorporates case studies, such as David's, and my own research on topics \nranging through Capgras Syndrome, chronic pain, calendar synesthesia, gender incongruity, mirror visual \nfeedback, and obsessive-compulsive disorder, the majority of which I have not considered in detail in my \nprevious books. \n\"I conclude by visiting some of the most prized but elusive aspects of our minds considered unapproachable by \nscience, such as math, music, and metaphor, and suggest that these quintessentially human abilities are best \nelucidated by combining an evolutionary approach with old-fashioned neurology.\" \nV.S.

Frankfurt 2016 Hotlist \n-11-\nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 025157 \n\"us\" or \"they\" and it's a question asked millions of times a day in all the languages of the world in response to \nall manner of human behavior, good and bad. \nWhat brings out the best in us? What brings out the worst? For every complex problem, there's a solution that's \nsimple, appealing, and wrong, H. L. Mencken famously said, and there are certainly many simple and wrong \nanswers to this most important of questions, the question at the root of the way we parent, the way we educate, \nthe way we manage, and the way we punish. The simple yet correct response, of course, is that it's \ncomplicated. The longer answer? For that, the great neuroscientist and primatologist Robert Sapolsky needed \nten years, and this book. \nBehave is an epic achievement. In order to make sense of all the sources that conspire to affect human behavior, \nit begins in the very moment of action, when we commit the decisive deed in question. What is happening in \nour brain and body at the very moment, and in the minutes that preceded it? The book then pulls back to look \nhow the behavior is conditioned by what the body is exposed to in the days, weeks and months leading up to \nthat behavior. It then goes back to childhood and adolescence, at how the bending of the bough effects how the \ntree grows. And so on, from neurobiology, endocrinology and the interaction of our senses with the \nenvironment to a lifetime's most primal shaping influences, and from there back to our genetic makeup and the \nvery sticky wicket of how genes and environment interact (and how they don't). Finally, Sapolsky expands the \nview to take in factors that push us past any single person's inheritance and experience: namely culture, in the \npresent tense and back hundreds, even thousands of years, and then back millions of years, to the first humans \nand the evolution of behavior. \nThe result is surely among the most dazzling tours d 'horizon of the science of human behavior ever attempted, \na majestic synthesis of cutting-edge research, some of it the author's own, across a range of disciplines to \nprovide a subtle and necessary reckoning with the roots of our most troubling and inspiring behaviors, relating \nto racism, tribalism, and xenophobia; tolerance and altruism; hierarchy and competition; morality and free will; \nand war and peace. Wise, learned, funny, and fearless, Behave is a great scientist's towering achievement, a \nbook that takes both the angel and the devil off of our shoulders and into our hands. \nROBERT SAPOLSKY is the John A. and Cynthia Fry Gunn Professor at Stanford University, holding joint \nappointments in several departments, including Biological Sciences, Neurology & Neurological Sciences, and \nNeurosurgery.

Yet this saga is an untold story, as far as today's general audience is \nconcerned. Taming Infinity will tell it for the first time. \nBrockman, Inc. Frankfurt 2016 Hotlist \n-12-\nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 025158 \n\"Calculus is one of the greatest ideas that anyone has ever had and certainly the greatest idea in all of \nmathematics. The scientific and technological importance of calculus is one reason why we require all budding \nscientists and engineers to learn the subject. Taming Infinity is the human side of calculus: the gripping story of \nhow it was discovered, and lost, and then rediscovered a thousand years later, or how it perplexed many of the \ngeniuses who struggled to invent it, and in a few tragic cases, drove them insane. In a very real sense, this \nhumanistic side of calculus is just as fascinating and important as its scientific side as it, too, has changed the \nworld. \n\"Central to the story is the mathematicians' quest to tame infinity, which begins with the philosopher Zeno of \nElea (about 450 BC, before Socrates) who raised paradoxes about infinity, continuity, time, space, and motion \nthat confounded his contemporaries and provoked no less than Aristotle to banish infinity from Greek \nphilosophy and mathematics from then on. Fast-forward more than 2,500 years, and we're still wrestling with \ninfinity and the paradoxes it raises. In between, the inventors of calculus, starting with Archimedes around 250 \nBC and culminating with Newton and Leibniz in the mid-1600s, tried to domesticate infinity to make what we \nnow regard as integral and differential calculus. And to a large extent, they succeeded. The carefully controlled \nuse of infinity is the secret to calculus, the source of its enormous predictive power. \n\"But like Frankenstein's monster or the golem in Jewish folklore, infinity was never quite under control. As in \nany tale of hubris, the monster inevitably turned on its creator. Soon after the work of Newton and Leibniz, \ndisturbing paradoxes emerged in the 1700s and early 1800s. Calculations came out wrong. Calculus seemed \nunreliable. These difficulties provoked another wave of philosophical and logical handwringing, much as Zeno's \nhad two millennia earlier. These conundrums were resolved over the next century by the mathematicians who \ncalled themselves 'analysts.' The name was apt. They put calculus on the couch, and probed it, trying to root out \nevery last trace of pathology. They succeeded for calculus, but not for infinity itself. There the pathology ran \ndeeper. The riddles of infinity are still challenging logicians, mathematicians, and philosophers today.\" \nSTEVEN STROGATZ is the Jacob Gould Schurman Professor of Applied Mathematics at Cornell University. \nHe is the bestselling author of The Joy Of X, The Calculus Of Friendship, and Sync.

Norton; Proposal; 70,000 words; Delivery: February 2018] \nAdam Waytz is a rising star in the Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University, whose research \nuses methods from social psychology and cognitive neuroscience to study how people think about minds. Waytz \nis the first person to receive twice the Theoretical Innovation Prize from the Society for Personality and Social \nPsychology. He is also the winner of the SAGE Young Scholar Award and the International Social Cognition \nNetwork's Early Career Award. \nWaytz writes: \"Everyday life is increasingly human-free. Robotic technology has begun replacing human jobs \nand will replace millions more over the next five years. In domains such as manufacturing and agriculture, \nrobotic employees are already a reality. Tasks like getting directions from another human or consulting with a \nbank teller to deposit money have become obsolete. These advances contribute to well-documented declines in \nsocial interaction. Not only has interaction with human beings diminished, but existing human interaction has \nBrockman, Inc. Frankfurt 2016 Hotlist \n-13-\nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 025159 \ndeclined in quality. People feel less trusting of others than in previous decades, face-to-face communication is \nless frequent, and people's social networks have become more fragmented, producing smaller social clusters \nrather than expansive, civic community groups. Empathy with other humans, considering others' wants, feelings, \nneeds, and motivations (the essence of what makes us human), has diminished considerably. Rises in income \ninequality and political polarization also mean that our diversity of social experiences—encountering people \nunlike 'us' —is diminishing as well, enabling little consideration of humans dissimilar to ourselves. \n\"The Power of Human represents a call to action. This book details the psychological cost of losing our \nhumanity and elucidates scientifically supported strategies to counteract this trend, many of which are already \nunderway. Although scholars have bemoaned declines in social interaction, their concerns often erroneously \ncenter on people's deteriorating social skills, communication abilities, and intelligence (for which evidence is \ndecidedly mixed). Meanwhile, the real costs of this decline on moral behavior, employee productivity, \nmobilizing social movements, and finding meaning in life have gone overlooked. This book elucidates how we \noften overlook how psychologically powerful humans are, and provides strategies to rejuvenate efforts to \nrecognize others' humanity. \n\"The Power of Human is unique in providing solutions to this problem that will help businesses retain customers \nand employees, help charities raise more money, help people experience greater significance from simple \neveryday activities, help technologists design better robots, help reduce conflict between different political and \nreligious sects, and increase happiness in relationships with friends and spouses.\" \nADAM WAYTZ is an associate professor of management and organizations in the Kellogg School of \nManagement at Northwestern University. His research has been published in leading journals such as \nProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, and \nPsychological Review. Waytz received the 2008 and 2013 Theoretical Innovation Award from the Society for \nPersonality and Social Psychology, the SAGE Foundation Young Scholar Award, and the International Social \nCognition Network's Early Career Award. In 2015, Poets and Quants named him one of the \"Best 40 Business \nSchool Professors Under the Age of 40.\" He has written articles for the New York Times, the Boston Globe, Wall \nStreet Journal, Harvard Business Review, Scientific American, and Slate. \nSCALE \nThe Search for Simplicity and Unity in the Complexity of Life, from Cells to Cities, Companies to \nEcosystems, Milliseconds to Millennia \nBy Geoffrey West \n[US — Penguin Press, UK — Weidenfeld & Nicolson, Holland — Het Spectrum, Finland — Terra Cognita, \nBrazil — Das Letras; Japan — Hayakawa; Korea — Gimm Young; Taiwan — Locus; China — CITIC; Russia \n— Atticus; Audio — Penguin RH; Manuscript; 400 pages; Publication: May 2017] \nThe former head of the Sante Fe Institute, visionary physicist Geoffrey West is a pioneer in the field of \ncomplexity science, the science of emergent systems and networks. The term \"complexity\" can be misleading, \nhowever, because what makes West's discoveries so beautiful is that he has found an underlying simplicity that \nunites the seemingly complex and diverse phenomena of living systems, including our bodies, our cities and our \nbusinesses. \nFascinated by issues of aging and mortality, West applied the rigor of a physicist to the biological question of \nwhy we live as long as we do and no longer. The result was astonishing and changed science, creating a new \nunderstanding of energy use and metabolism: West found that despite the riotous diversity in the sizes of \nmammals, they are all, to a large degree, scaled versions of each other. If you know the size of a mammal, you \ncan use scaling laws to learn everything from how much food it eats per day, what its heart-rate is, how long it \nwill take to mature, its lifespan, and so on. Furthermore, the efficiency of the mammal's circulatory systems \nBrockman, Inc. Frankfurt 2016 Hotlist \n-14-\nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 025160 \nscales up precisely based on weight: If you compare a mouse, a human and an elephant on a logarithmic graph, \nyou find with every doubling of average weight, a species gets 25% more efficient—and lives 25% longer. This \nspeaks to everything from how long we can expect to live to how many hours of sleep we need. Fundamentally, \nhe has proven, the issue has to do with the fractal geometry of the networks that supply energy and remove \nwaste from the organism's body. \nWest's work has been game-changing for biologists, but then he made the even bolder move of exploring his \nwork's applicability to cities. Cities, too, are constellations of networks and laws of scalability relate with eerie \nprecision to them. For every doubling in a city's size, the city needs 15% less road, electrical wire, and gas \nstations to support the same population. More amazingly, for every doubling in size, cities produce 15% more \npatents and more wealth, as well as 15% more crime and disease. This broad pattern lays the groundwork for a \nnew science of cities. \nRecently, West has applied his revolutionary work on cities and biological life to the business world. This \ninvestigation has led to powerful insights into why some companies thrive while others fail. The implications of \nthese discoveries are far-reaching, and are just beginning to be explored. \nScale is a thrilling scientific adventure story about the elemental natural laws that bind us together in simple but \nprofound ways. Through the brilliant mind of Geoffrey West, we can envision how cities, companies and \nbiological life alike are dancing to the same simple, powerful tune, however diverse and unrelated they are to \neach other. \nGEOFFREY WEST, a theoretical physicist, is distinguished professor and past president at Santa Fe Institute. \nHis primary interests have been in fundamental questions in physics and biology. West is a Senior Fellow at Los \nAlamos National Laboratory and a distinguished professor at the Sante Fe Institute, where he served as the \npresident from 2005-2009. He has been featured in many publications world-wide including the New York \nTimes, Nature, Science, the Financial Times, Wired and Scientific American, and has participated in television \nproductions including Nova, the National Geographic and the BBC. His work on cities and companies was \nselected as a breakthrough idea of 2007 by Harvard Business Review, and in 2006 he was selected for Time \nMagazine's list of \"100 Most Influential People in the World.\" \nFUNDAMENTALS \n(working title) \nBy Frank Wilczek Herman Feshbach Professor of Physics, MIT \nRecipient, 2004 Nobel Prize in Physics \n[US — Penguin Press, UK — Allen Lane, Audio — Penguin RH; Proposal; 50,000 words; Delivery: March \n2019] \nAn exciting new book by Frank Wilczek, one of the world's most eminent theoretical physicists and the most \nimportant of his generation. His scientific work provides the basis for the LHC experiments at CERN. He has \nreceived many prizes for his work in physics, including the Nobel Prize (2004) for work he did as a graduate \nstudent at Princeton University, when he was twenty-one years old, and the King Faisal Prize in 2005. \nWrites Wilczek: \"The premise of the book is simple: I formulated ten basic propositions, which together convey \nthe core of what every thinking person should know about science. In Fundamentals, the ten basic propositions \nsupport a series of interesting and connected chapters, which give historical and cultural context, outline the \nevidence, and draw out the implications. I want the marketing of this book to be based on the following slogan: \n\"If you read just one book about science, this should be the one.\" \nHere are three examples of the ten basic propositions: \nBrockman, Inc. Frankfurt 2016 Hotlist \n-15-\nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 025161 \n1. The World Is Very Big \nOur neighborhood (Earth, Solar System, Milky Way). The accessible universe. How we measure large \ndistances. Consistency checks. The multitudes within. \n2. The World Is Very Old \nThe nature of time. How we measure the age of objects on Earth. What we mean by the age of the \nuniverse, and how we measure it. Consistency checks. \n3. Matter Is Built From A Small Menu Of Ingredients, Which Exist In Vast Quantities \nMicroscopy and its modern refinements. Matter from the bottom up—building from electrons, photons, \nnuclei (protons and neutrons) to everyday materials. How we analyze the chemistry of distant objects, \nlike stars, and establish that they're made of the same stuff. Extraordinary objects. \nFundamentals is a short, sophisticated book that the explains fundamentals of science. \nFRANK WILCZEK won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2004 for work he did as a graduate student. His 1989 \nbook, Longing for the Harmonies, was a New York Times notable book of the year.

L. & Criminology 59, *102\n\nIn other words, while few state judiciaries have addressed the precise timing of state crime victims’ rights, those that have\naddressed the question have typically found that the rights do extend to pre-charging situations.\n\nDespite the relative dearth of state court cases, it is worth noting that most state statutes unequivocally provide for notification\nrights early in the criminal process. 7>! For example, the Illinois statute imposes a limited duty on law enforcement agencies to\nkeep victims mformed of the status of an investigation until the accused is apprehended or the agency discontinues the\ninvestigation. *°? Similarly, law enforcement agencies in Iowa must keep the victim apprised of the investigation \"until the\nalleged assailant is apprehended or the investigation is closed.\" 7°? Michigan's statute requires law enforcement to provide\ninformation within a mere twenty-four hours of contact between the agency and the victim. 74\n\nIn sum, while state law on crime victims' rights before charging is not fully developed, what law exists tends to support the\nposition that crime victims deserve rights before the formal filing of charges. This law fits the long-standing trend in states\ntoward expanding protections for crime [*103] victims. *°° The decision by state legislators to extend notification or\nconferral rights to crime victims demonstrates an express recognition that crime victims' meaningful participation in the\ncriminal justice process may involve granting those victims rights before indictment.\n\nConclusion\n\nCrime victims have important rights at stake in the criminal justice process, even before prosecutors formally file criminal\ncharges. It is hardly surprising, therefore, to find that a federal law that Congress in fact designed to create \"broad and\nencompassing\" rights for victims protects victims during a criminal investigation. As this Article has explained, interpreting the\nCVRA to cover crime victims during the pre-charging phase of a case is consistent with the statute's purposes, text, legislative\nhistory, and interpretive case law. And state criminal justice systems also appear to be moving in that direction.\n\nThe Justice Department's contrary interpretation seems unlikely to prevail when challenged. The CVRA signals a paradigm\nshift in the way that crime victims are to be treated, at least within the federal criminal justice system. Before enactment of the\nlaw, federal investigators and prosecutors might have been able to keep victims at arm's length, refusing to confer with them\nabout the case and otherwise ignoring or even mistreating them during the process. But those days are over. The CVRA\npromises victims that they now have the right to confer with prosecutors and the right to be treated fairly while their cases are\ninvestigated. It is time for the Department of Justice to recognize and embrace that new reality.\n\nJournal of Criminal Law & Criminology\n\n249 See Ex parte Littlefield, 540 S.E.2d 81, 85 (S.C. 2000).\n\n250 See Kimberly J.

There could be no better foundation for the next phase of my\ncareer—teaching law students at the nation’s largest and most prestigious law school, Harvard.\n\nBefore I leave the Supreme Court, I must recount one vignette regarding Justice Goldberg that\ncaused me considerable disappointment. One of the great villains of the day to all liberals was J.\nEdgar Hoover, the head of the FBI. On several occasions, I let my negative views about Hoover\nbe known to Goldberg, but he never said a word. I didn’t understand why. A few years later, I\nasked Bazelon, who smiled, and said “I probably shouldn’t tell you, but it’s important for you to\nknow that there are no perfect heroes.” He continued, “Hoover and Goldberg got along well,\nbecause when Goldberg was the lawyer for the labor movement, he worked hard to rid the C.I.O.\nof Communist influence.” I asked whether that meant he informed on Communist with the Union.\nBazelon replied, “I wouldn’t use the word informed, but he worked closely with Hoover on a\ncommon goal: to rid the C.I.O. of Communist influence.”\n\nBazelon then told me that Thurgood Marshall had played a similar role with regard to the\nNAACP-—trying to cleanse it of Communist influences.”\n\n“That’s how Thurgood and Arthur made it to the Court. If Hoover had opposed them, they\nmight not have been appointed.”\n\nI was shocked. “But there have been other liberals appointed as well,” I insisted.\n\n“Yes, Douglas, but he was Joe Kennedy’s boy, and Hoover liked Joe Kennedy, at least back in the\nday when Douglas was appointed. With Hoover, it wasn’t so much what you believed as were\nyou with Hoover or against him.”\n\n“What about Justice Brennan?,” I asked.\n\n“Bill was an accident, an Eisenhower mistake. They didn’t know he would be so liberal.\nEisenhower regarded Warren and Brennan as his worst mistakes.”\n\nBazelon then paused and said he would tell me something else, if I promised to keep it a secret\nuntil Goldberg and Marshall were both dead. I promised.\n\n“Hoover had something on both of them.”\n“What?” I asked.\n\n“Goldberg apparently had a brief ‘friendship’ with some European woman who may have been a\nRussian spy. Hoover covered it up.”\n\n68\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_017155\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}
