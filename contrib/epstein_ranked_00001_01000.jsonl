Even if he was released on bail, the Hong Kong\nauthorities would almost certainly retain all the NSA and GCHQ files he had gone to such lengths\nto steal. He also would not be allowed to leave Hong Kong and possibly denied any access to the\nInternet. As he demonstrated by his subsequent actions, this option was not acceptable to him.\n\nOnce the U.S. criminal complaint was unsealed on June 21, 2013, which became all but\ninevitable after his video, his only route out of Hong Kong went through two adversaries of the\nUnited States, China and Russia. China, as far as is known, did not offer him sanctuary.\nAccording to one U.S diplomat, it may have already obtained copies of Snowden’s NSA files, and\ndid not want the problem of having Snowden defect to Beijing. In any case, if it had not already\nacquired the files. It could assume it would receive that intelligence data from its Russian ally in\nthe intelligence war. Whatever its reason, China did not use its considerable power in Hong\nKong to block Snowden’s exit.\n\nNor did Snowden obtain a visa to any country in Latin America or elsewhere during his month-\nlong stay in Hong Kong. As in the oft-cited Sherlock Holmes’ clue of the dog that did not bark,\nSnowden’s lack of any visas in his passport strongly suggests that he had not made plans to go\nanyplace but where he went: Moscow. His actions here, including his contacts with Russian\nofficials in Hong Kong, speak louder than his words.\n\nSnowden chose, if he had any choice left at all, the Russian option. Just as he believed Chinese\nintelligence could protect him in Hong Kong from the United States, he could assume that the\nFSB could protect him in Moscow from the United States. He was not entirely na* ve about its\ncapabilities. During his service in the CIA, he had taken a month-long training course at the CIA’s\n“farm” at Fort Peary in which counterintelligence officer taught about the capabilities the Russian\nsecurity services\n\nTo be sure, he might not have known that Moscow would be his final destination. He may\nhave naively believed that Russia would allow a defector from the NSA who claimed to have had\naccess to the NSA’s sources in Russia and China leave Moscow before its security services\nobtained that information. But that was not to be.\n\nIt is not uncommon for a defector to change sides in order to find a better life for himself in\nanother country. Some defectors flee to escape a repressive government or to find one in which\nthey believe they are more closely attuned. But Russia is ordinarily not the country of choice for\nsomeone such as Snowden seeking greater civil liberties and personal freedom. So why did\nSnowden choose Russia for his new life?\n\nThe four choices that Snowden made in 2013 did not come out of the blue. They all were\nplanned out well in advance. He applied for the job to Booz Allen in February 2013, more than a\nmonth before leaving his job at Dell. He applied to Booz Allen for his medical leave, although in\nfact he had no medical problem, a month before departing for Hong Kong. He brought with him\nto Hong Kong enough cash to pay his living expenses, according to him, for the next two years.\nHe arranged the encrypted channel with Poitras in February 2013, three months before he would\ninduce her to come to Hong Kong. He made contact with a foreign diplomatic mission at least a\nmonth before flying to Moscow and, at some point, met with Russian officials, who arranged a\nvisa-less entry for him. He called Assange in London to arrange for Wikileaks help, 13 days\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_020367\n"}}}

The decision, despite its limited scope was\ncharacterized as a “Magna Carta for nudism.’’)\n\nPornography, like nudity, offends many Americans, but there are those who would ban not only\npublic displays of pornography, but private use as well. They argue that three distinct types of\nharm are caused by pornography. The first, as with nudity, is that it is offensive to many people\nwho are involuntarily exposed to it. No empirical evidence is required to prove this kind of harm:\nif people say they are offended, that is the end of the matter. The second is that some people are\noffended by the mere knowledge that other people, who are not offending by watching it, are\nwatching it in private. Whether this type of what I call “vicarious offensiveness” warrants an\nexcept to the First Amendment raises profound legal issues. The third, very different, kind of\nharm is that pornography is alleged to cause rape and other physical violence against women.\nThis allegation, which if true would warrant legal protection, is hotly disputed and unproven, if\nnot improvable.**\n\ngroup, he might respond by striking back. Hence, such provocatively offensive expressions have been called\n“fighting words” and have been denied First Amendment protection by some courts over the years. This concept\nhas assumed center stage recently, as some Muslim groups, individuals and even nations have threatened violence\nin response to the publication of “offensive” books, cartoons and other media critiques of Islam and its prophet.\nThe stakes have also risen. Instead of merely fighting words, some radical Muslims regard insults to the prophet\nas killing and bombing words.\n\n* The issue is somewhat complicated, because it may be true that certain kinds of violent pornography (as well as\nviolent non-pornography) may be contributing factors in certain people’s decision or propensity to rape, just as\nalcohol or other drugs may be contributing factors. What is undeniably clear is that only a miniscule fraction of\nmen who view pornography go on to rape or commit violence, and that a great many rapists do not view\npornography.

By the time Shimon Peres, the\nNobel Prize-winning prime minister\nof Israel who helped resolve many of\nthe more intangible issues, died more\npeacefully aged 93 in 2016, he had\nbecome one of the most accomplished\nstatesmen of our age.\nBut perhaps the greatest casualty\nfrom that era – when there were\ngenuine expectations on both sides of\nthe Israeli-Palestinian divide that the\nconflict might be resolved peacefully\n– has been the peace process itself,\nwhich today is almost nonexistent.\nWhen, for example, I told an Arab\nambassador acquaintance I was\ngoing to see a preview of the play,\nhe simply remarked: “No one talks\nabout the peace process any more. It\ndoesn’t exist.”\nThis makes Roger’s examination of\none of the most unlikely diplomatic\ndialogues ever undertaken all the\nmore poignant, as it harks back to\nan era when reconciliation seemed\ngenuinely possible.\nThe task facing the rival delegates\nwhen they first meet is a daunting\none. For the Israelis, if the fact became\nknown that they were talking to the\nPLO, the government would most\nlikely fall. For the Palestinians, it\nwould mean an assassin’s bullet.\nAt the heart of this danse macabre\nstands Rød-Larsen, whom I met on\nseveral occasions in Jerusalem in the\nNineties when the hard work had\nbegun on implementing the deal. A\nquiet, patient man, he never seemed\nto be entirely comfortable with the\nrough-house atmosphere of the\nregion, where disputes were often\nmore likely to be resolved through\nrocks and rubber bullets than rational\npersuasion.\nToby Stephens’s portrayal of Rød-\nLarsen gives him a great deal more\nzest and personality than I recall, but\nthis neatly nuanced performance is\nkey to the pace of this fast-moving,\nentertaining take on the events (Rogers\nhas said that, in order to liven up what\nmight otherwise seem a prosaic and\nconvoluted political process, he studied\nthe plays of Noël Coward).\nMy favourite scene from the play\nis the one where the lead Israeli\nnegotiator, taking a break from\nthe negotiations, entertains his\nPalestinian counterparts by giving\nan impersonation of Arafat as an\neffeminate narcissist, a portrayal I\nfound entirely plausible from my\nown encounters with the PLO leader,\nwhose vanity knew no bounds.\nUri Savir, who was deputed by\nPeres to run the Israeli side of the\nnegotiations, was someone else I\ngot to know during that period. An\nurbane multi-linguist of an academic\ndisposition, I generally found Uri to\nbe softly spoken and thoughtful when\ndiscussing regional issues. Philip\nArditti’s portrayal of him in the play,\nthough, makes him out to be more\nlike the uncompromising, muscular\nIsraeli type, more usually found in the\nranks of the security forces than in the\ndiplomatic service.\nDepictions in theatre of almost\nanything to do with the Middle East\ntend to stir strong passions among\naudiences. I was particularly struck by\nRogers’ sympathetic understanding\nof the Palestinian predicament. “I was\nvery anxious about the combustibility\nof it,” said Rogers in a recent\ninterview. “I assumed there would be\ncontroversy [in America] only because\nsomeone would be enraged that I had\nallowed the ‘other side’ to have their\nsay.” Certainly Peter Polycarpou’s\ndepiction of Ahmed Qurei, the\nPalestinian finance minister sent\nby Arafat to make peace, admirably\ncaptures the conflicting emotions\nof enduring the pain of exile while\nseeking to wreak terrible vengeance\non the Israeli occupiers.\nIndeed, for all the quips and\nlight-hearted banter, Oslo is, at heart,\na deeply emotional drama. When the\nIsraelis finally strike a deal with the\nPalestinians during a telephone call to\nArafat’s headquarters in Tunis, they\nthink they can hear music playing\nin the background. In fact it is the\nbattle-hardened veterans of the PLO\nsobbing at the prospect of being\nallowed to return to their homeland.\nUltimately, the play is an implicit\ntragedy about the failure of both sides\nto build a lasting peace on the basis of\nthe painful concessions made during\nReproduced by Gorkana under licence from the NLA (newspapers), CLA (magazines), FT (Financial Times/ft.com) or other copyright owner.

Patrick is one of the leading sleep and dream researchers (he himself more dreams). More \nimportantly, he is perhaps the leading chronicler of the field, with many publications (including 26 entries in \nrelated encyclopedias). He is co-editor-in-chief of the \"Encyclopedia of Sleep and Dreams\" (2012) and \nthe sole author of the forthcoming \"An Introduction to the Neuroscience of Sleep and Dreams\" (Cambridge \nUniversity Press, 2018), which intends to present the latest science and to become a main textbook for \ngraduate courses/seminars. Patrick is a CTT contributor and colleague. \nWhen we asked Patrick, his first response — \"This is the ideal time to tell the sleep-and-dreams story\" — and he \ncited (in essence) your two questions, in that (i) the multiple breakthroughs are now sufficiently well \ncorroborated by numerous independent labs such that a substantial foundation for the new, deeper \nunderstanding of sleep and dreams is now for the first time (over the past few years) confirmed and \nestablished, and (ii) there are now interesting application and critical clinical questions to pose, explore and \npursue, such as for the treatment of various mental-related illnesses that have known sleep-related syndromes \n(e.g., PTSD and Depression). \nTo understand the significance of recent breakthroughs, a defining characteristic of sleep and dreams is that \nthere are two distinct kinds of sleep — REM (rapid-eye-movement) Sleep and NREM (non-rapid-eye-\nmovement) Sleep. Most dreams are associated with REM sleep (though complex). The eye movement \ngives the eponymous name, but a more important designation defines the two stages in terms of brain waves \n(electroencephalograph — EEG): REM is Fast-Wave Sleep (similar to the waking state) and NREM Sleep is \nSlow-Wave Sleep (very different from the waking state). This difference between REM and NREM sleep has \nbeen known since 1953 (different EEGs since 1937), but its deep significance has only been discovered and \nconfirmed in very recent years (as explained below). \nFollowing are the key areas of breakthrough in sleep and dreams (from Patrick). Patrick states that these are \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 025191 \nnow reproducible, non-controversial, and well-accepted among experts, although still not appreciated by the \npublic - hence the high value of our CTT TV series. The organizing idea is why and how are sleep and dreams \nessential for normal memory consolidation and bodily health / well-being. \nMemory Consolidation. There is a fundamental difference between REM and NREM Sleep for memory \nconsolidation: REM is for emotional memories, whereas NREM is for declarative and procedural memories. \nHence, understanding and dealing with REM emotional memories can lead to treatment for the many \nneuropsychiatric illnesses that have sleep/dream-related disorders or syndromes (Parkinson's Disease, \nAnxiety, Substance Abuse, many sleep disorders such as Nightmare Disorder, etc., in addition to PTSD and \nDepression). Research shows bi-directional causality between neuropsychiatric disorders and sleep disorders. \nThis is a superb example of how fundamental science breakthroughs lead to clinical breakthroughs. This fact \nthat REM is associated with emotional memories is nicely consistent with the apparent psychotic nature of \ndreams, because in REM Sleep the frontal cortex is 'down-regulated' (and the frontal cortex is associated with \nrational planning, reflection, controlling impulses), while in REM Sleep the limbic system is 'up-regulated\" \n(and the limbic system is associated with emotions and feelings) — see Neuroimaging below. This is \nwhy dream states flood the ego with emotional fantasies without rational control. However, it is also true that \nthe limbic system enables creative ideas, thus grounding in science the long-suspected idea that sleep and \ndreams can enhance creativity. \nAs Dr. Robert Stickgold, our other advisor on the series, wrote: \"It would be nice if we could talk about sleep \nand memory as if there were only one type of memory and one type of sleep. But this is far from the case. \nSleep and memory each comes in many forms, and furthermore, memories can go through multiple forms of \npost-encoding processing that must be individually addressed.\" \nImmunity / Immune System. Strengthening the immune system is now a proven product of NREM sleep. \nDiscerning the evolutionary basis for this is a key research project (i.e., it seems counter-intuitive \nthat sleeping facilitates fitness for survival in that predators lurked in the jungles and on the plains so that \ngoing unconscious during sleep does not, at first glance, seem especially adaptive). Studies of sleep in various \nnon-human animals reveals a direct relationship between longer periods of NREM (Slow-Wave) Sleep and a \nstronger immune system, especially in fighting parasites. NREM Sleep releases molecules that \nfight inflection; NREM Sleep works for the maintenance, repair and activation of the immune system. (This \ngives scientific rationale for the need or desire to sleep during illnesses.) Related are \"genetic conflict\" studies \nwith respect to REM and NREM, showing differences in heredity between material and paternal lines, and \ndifferences between males and females in which genes get \"imprinted\". \nNeuroplasticity. Exciting recent research has reversed the century-long conventional wisdom that new \nneurons are never created in adult animals/humans. The development of new neurons — neuronogenesis — is a \nvital part of maintaining normal brain and mental functioning. New neurons are being created, importantly, in \nthe hippocampus (brain organ where new memories are encoded) — but, remarkably, the neuronogensis in \nthe hippocampus occurs only/largely during REM Sleep — a stunning finding. This is another reason why \nREM sleep is needed for emotional memory consolidation (normal functioning). \nDream-Content. Although dreams have sparked human fascination and fantasy for thousands of years, only \nin very recent years, have large-scale surveys been conducted with rigorous design, classifications and \nstatistical analysis. Literally hundreds of thousands of dreams are enabling statistically significant theories, \nincluding cross-cultural analyses (similarities and differences). Dream-posting sites have revolutionized size \nand structure of dream data sets. This enables, for the first time, longitudinal studies of dreams over time. \nPatterns are repeated. For example, in general, the dreams of males and females differ in fundamental ways. \nMales will engage in fighting with other males; females with both males and females. Male dreamers \nare often the initiator of fights and the fights are usually physical. Females fight verbally. Aggressiveness \nby the dreamer is almost always in REM Sleep, rarely in NREM Sleep. (Why is a continuing question.) \n\"Lucid Dreaming\" is a new area of fascinating research. Lucid Dreaming is where the dreamer \"knows\" that \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 025192 \nhe/she is dreaming while dreaming (a talent that a small minority possesses but more can be \ntrained/developed). Lucid dreamers, while sleeping, can now communicate with experimenters by altering \ntheir brain activity and thus becoming detectable by neuroimaging techniques (see below). \nNeuroimaging. Finally, neuroimaging technology has enabled many of these breakthroughs. As such, it is \nitself a methodological breakthrough that has enabled these other content breakthroughs. Neuroimaging now \nenables detailed location of the neuroanatomy and neurophysiology of REM and NREM Sleep. In \nREM Sleep, the dorsolateral, frontal cortex is \"down-regulated\", whereas the limbic system is \"up-regulated\", \nshowing the physiological basis for the emotional, wild-fantasies of dreams (see above). (Neuroimaging will \nenable good visual images for the TV series without extra costs.) \nPatrick stresses that while these breakthroughs form, for the first time, a solid foundation for understanding \nsleep and dreams, they also open opportunities to dig deeper into the \"purpose\" of sleep and dreams, as well \nas engender a new series of questions and directions (e.g., clinical treatments of illnesses). \nAttached is Patrick's quick compiling of summaries of a few recent leading research papers (2009 — 2017, \nespecially 2015-2017). \nYou'd enjoy speaking with him, if you want. \nLove to do this series together with you. \nMuch appreciate and warm regards, \nRobert \nplease note \nThe information contained in this communication is \nconfidential, may be attorney-client privileged, may \nconstitute inside information, and is intended only for \nthe use of the addressee.

The battle for potential Supreme Court justice Brett Kavanaugh's \nnomination this fall will only amplify the polarity of the political debate that is already deeply \noverwrought on both sides. The rising tide of pressure on Donald Trump from the Mueller investigation \nshows no sign of ebbing. \nUnless the underlying political dynamics are disrupted, the outcomes of these unprecedented events will \nstill leave us with the same unsatisfactory two front battlefield of the 2016 Presidential election. \nWatching these unrelenting, compounding events since our discussion in May, I am guessing we are all \nasking the same question: now what? For the 48 percent of Americans who believe Donald Trump \nshould not be in the White House, perhaps we too want our own \"chaos\" candidate in 2020? \nShould Trump run again, this could be a \"break glass\" moment for the majority of Americans who don't \nsupport him. Do we want to break the genteel precedents of two parties running their ceremonious and \nseemingly illogical nominating process to select a candidate? (Why do Iowa and New Hampshire play \nsuch outsized roles? What kind of small-d democratic process relies on superdelegates?) The system \nfailed in 2016, with both parties producing terribly flawed candidates in a race to the bottom. We need to \nbuild a back-up plan in the event the system fails again. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 026499 \nIt's possible, of course, that we won't need a third-party candidate. Trump could decide not to run for \nwhatever reason. The Democrats could nominate a winning 2020 candidate. I am not willing to take \nthose bets. \nThe ideal candidate for a new third party is someone who is widely perceived to be that rare combination \nof both good and great. We are looking for a proven leader of men and women, someone with clear, \ndemocratic — and moral — values that reflect the best of America, not our worst. We know people like this \non the national stage now. \nAs a thought experiment, consider the possibilities of a ticket outside the partisan lanes and imagine the \nchemistry of radical combinations: Biden/Romney? Bill Gates/Hogan? Bloomberg/Haley? Howard \nSchultz/Bob Corker? Sandberg/Kasich? \nAs we have discussed narrow path to electing the first president outside the two major party primary \nsystem in 168 years is more navigable than most think. Heading into 2020, converging trends in \nAmerican's demands for a third party (a historic high of 61%), disapproval of Donald Trump holding \nsteady above 50%, and the increasingly leftward drift of the Democratic Party suggest that electorate may \nbe susceptible to merits of a new centrist party. Cynics will say that the structural impediments of ballot \nand presidential debate access, the overwhelming advantages of legacy parties' fundraising and voter \nturn-out operations preordain failure, but they're wrong; the legal and logistical hurdles are amenable to a \ncombination of lawyering and resources. The bigger, more consequential factors come in terms of \ncandidate quality and policy. I believe a candidate with five specific characteristics including a unique — \nand purposefully non-specific - policy agenda could limbo a win. \n• This is what I think a successful third-party candidate looks like; a dream third party ticket would \nstart off with enough name ID to be an instant contender. Building the name ID to run nationally is \njust too long and expensive of a process to accomplish in the 28 months until the next presidential \nelection. We can't beat a celebrity without some celebrity of our own, whether from politics, \nsports, business, or entertainment. Instantaneous name ID is so crucial because the candidate must \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 026500 \nstart out in striking distance in any three-way poll against Trump and a fill-in-the-blank \nDemocratic flavor-of-the day candidate. The media and political class will predetermine \nirrelevance otherwise. \n• A Democrat-leaning candidate would have to top the ideal third-party ticket. We need someone \nwith a shot at snaking a plurality of the vote in the blue states Hillary Clinton won (227 electoral \nvotes), but moderate enough to win a plurality in some combination of Trump states like Florida, \nPennsylvania, Wisconsin and Michigan (another 119 votes). The right candidate may even to put \nNorth Carolina, Ohio, Indiana in play for a centrist bi-partisan ticket as well (totaling an electoral \nsweep of 464 elector votes). A right leaning candidate would meet the same fate as a primary \nchallenger to Trump — for all intents and purposes we need to assume that 36% of voters won't be \ncleaved from Trump under any circumstances and run to win around them. The deep red states \nwould be off the table entirely. \n• With the Trump reality show airing daily, voters are now expecting to take their politics with a side \nof entertainment. Heretofore, ratings will matter no matter how dry the policy topic. Surely \nStephen Colbert would gladly sacrifice his executive producer Chris Licht to produce a daily \ncomedic segment of this dream candidate interviewing Americans in truck stops and McDonald's \nacross the country. A few of the \"Saturday Night Live\" script writers could certainly be enticed to \ndisguise serious debates as informative amusement. Any candidate must be committed to a near \ndaily cadence of high quality, compelling video production. It will be especially crucial to keep \nthe voters' attention during what will be a raucous Democratic primary season. Rules governing \naccess to the general election debate stage dictate that a candidate enjoy support of at least 15% of \nvoters in the months leading up to the general election. \n• This dream candidate would pledge to serve only four years and address all of the U.S.'s ticking \ntime bombs like Social Security, Medicare, health care reform, climate change, money in politics, \ngerrymandering, and infrastructure investment in a single term. This one-and-done term decouples \nour candidate from the usual politics and gives them the power of promise and deliver decisive \naction. A four-year term pledge ensures governance independent of campaign finance concerns and \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 026501 \nnarrow special interests inherent to winning re-election. This \"fix-it\" ticket would promise to force \ndecisions on all the underlying structural policy matters damaging America's long-term prospects \nand distorting our democracy. No more kicking the can down the road. \n• This candidate should also pledge to push for laws passed that reflect the will of simple majorities \nin Congress. Congress now only allows bills to move forward when a \"majority of a majority\" \nsupports the policy and on many levels seems fundamentally broken. This third-party president \ncould force votes based on a transparent reading of where the votes lie via coalition building. The \nSenate filibuster power will present a high hurdle, but a third-party candidate would be a de facto \ndisruptor of the two-party system. Party discipline could well break down, and moderates in both \nparties could form a powerful, decisive block willing to work with the new President. The policies \npassed into law may not be ideal for either Democrats or Republicans, but for the major agenda \nitems that must be addressed for America's long-term health, an imperfect fix that corrects course \nis better than those that now have us hurtling toward national bankruptcy. \nAnd if no candidate secures 270 electoral votes in 2020? The House of Representatives would choose the \nnext president. In 2016, reports suggested Michael Bloomberg declined to run on a third-party ticket for \nfear of splitting support from Hillary Clinton and throwing the election to a GOP-controlled House of \nRepresentatives who would then vote to select the president. The fear was the GOP controlled House \nwould have just elected Trump. \nWould Democratic control of the House mean that the House would pick an alternative to Trump as \npresident? Each state delegation has a single vote in selecting a president and it is the incoming Congress \n- the class elected in 2020 that would decide the election. But no matter which party has the speaker's \nchair, the GOP would almost certainly have the upper hand in the majority of state delegations \ncontrolled. Would the state delegations pick a president based on party majority control of the \ndelegation, the winner of the popular vote in each state or their own calculations as to who is best for \nAmerica? Precedent suggests that delegations use secret ballots, which means individual lawmakers may \nvote their consciences. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 026502 \nIf we recruit this ideal candidate; threading the needle of name ID, a center-left bent, a TV- savvy \ncampaign team and a pledge to serve only four years with an apartisan agenda, money and campaign \nexpertise would certainly follow. And 50 state ballot access is a function of time (starting in the fall of \n2019 would be prudential) and hard work as we have discussed and many of you have exhaustively war-\ngamed. \nPart and parcel of this effort would be motivating the often politically lackadaisical middle to vote. The \nraft of new technologies in data targeting and biometric mobile voting technology could transform the \nelectorate in the next few, amping voter participation and injecting the voices of moderates (both in \npolitical views and level of political interest) into the process. And any third-party effort must \nincorporate advocacy for accelerated adaption of these all but inevitable voter verification tools. I believe \nSilicon Valley could be game-changing allies in this effort. \nI am sure none of us doubt that chaos could potentially be unleashed by jamming three viable candidates \ninto a two-party system. An election that ends up in the House of Representatives is an uncontrollable, \nmurky and ancient process. But might that be a less scary prospect than relying on the Democrats to \nnominate a candidate who can beat Trump in 2020? \nI look forward to talking more about all of our ideas on this hopeful project in coming weeks.

Watching our\nintricate mini-war draw to its close, he made no effort to hide his enthusiasm for\nthe kind of quick, assertive battlefield maneuvers he’d long championed. But\nmore than that, his closest aide soon began sounding me out on my views about\nthe long-term organization, force balance and funding for the Israeli military. A\nfew weeks later, Arik offered me a promotion: a return to the kirya, as a two-\nstar general, to become head of planning for the armed forces.\n\nI don’t know why he chose me: the Sinai exercise perhaps, the fact he knew\nI'd studied “large and complex organizations” at Stanford, or maybe just the\nfact our paths had first crossed two decades earlier when I was in Sayeret\nMatkal. But even though it meant leaving my division command, especially\ntough since the final Sinai withdrawal was approaching, it was an offer I never\ncontemplated turning down. Not just because of the second star on my uniform.\nEver since the 1973 war, along with a few other senior officers including Dan\nShomron, I had been making the case for a shift to more mobile and less\nvulnerable forces and weapons systems. I saw the new role as a chance to help\nencourage that critically important change.\n\nThere was just one hitch: all senior military assignments required the formal\napproval of the chief-of-staff, my old friend Raful Eitan. Raful did manage to\ndelay things for several weeks. At one point, he even brought to bear a quality\nI’d never suspected he had: a sense of humor. “OK, Pll agree to promote\nBarak,” he told Arik. The next day, he said he’d meant /itan Barak — a very\ngood commander, by the way, who had been one of my instructors in officers’\nschool. Arik insisted, however. My appointment went through.\n\nAnd one, unanticipated result was that I didn’t just play the field command\nrole I’d anticipated, from our Cinerama deployments, in Arik’s toweringly\nambitious, ill-planned and ultimately disastrous war in Lebanon.

Private compa-\nnies and investors have a clear interest in democratic\npublic goods like the rule of law, which guarantees\ntheir property rights, and the transparency provid-\n\ned by free media and corruption watchdogs, which\nensures the accuracy of economic data and the fair\nallocation of state contracts. They should therefore do\nwhat they can to prevent any further deterioration in\nthe condition of global democracy.\n\nSome sectors are especially vulnerable to authoritarian\npressure, and have a special role to play in combating it.\nWe urge the film industry to reject involvement in joint\nventures with companies that have close ties to au-\nthoritarian regimes and reputations for demanding po-\n\nliticized censorship of artistic content. We also urge the\ntechnology industry to refuse business arrangements\nthat require active complicity in or passive acceptance\nof political censorship or information control.\n\nTo the European Union: We urge the EU to undertake\na comprehensive review of member states’ democrat-\nic institutions to determine whether recent changes\nhave weakened checks and balances or unduly\nprotected incumbent parties from fair electoral com-\npetition. The EU should adopt measures to publicize\ndepartures from democratic standards and develop\n\na new set of sanctions that could be imposed on\nnoncompliant governments—whether inside, outside,\nor hoping to join the bloc—even in the absence of\nunanimity among member states. In the meantime,\nthe EU should use the sanctions already in place, even\nif it means freezing a member state's participation,\nand be prepared to actually impose any new sanctions\nthat might be introduced.\n\nTo private foundations: We urge private foundations\nto recognize and oppose the current assault on\ndemocracy. With a few exceptions, the great institu-\ntions of American philanthropy have studiously—and\nshamefully—ignored the steady erosion of global free-\ndom and the rise of authoritarian powers. The recent\ndevelopments in Europe and the United States will\nhopefully shake their complacency. There is a strong\nneed for analysis, support for individual dissidents,\nand aid for societies under authoritarian threat, and as\nmany democratic governments waver in their com-\nmitment to such priorities, it is essential for private\nfunders to step into the breach.\n\nTo mainstream political candidates: We urge re-\nsponsible political figures to call out colleagues or\nrivals when they show contempt for basic democratic\nideas. Until now, politicians in the democracies have\nbeen unimpressive in their responses to opponents\nwho embrace authoritarian figures like Putin.

But I think for all of us, even Arik, the issue\nof who was behind the bombing was hardly the most urgent concern. The\nimmediate danger was a revival of the kind of rampant bloodletting Lebanon\nhad endured in the civil war. The day after the assassination, I joined a half-\ndozen other members of the general staff and helicoptered up to the Lebanese\ncapital. Arik, ignoring weeks of US pressure not to do so, had already ordered\nIsraeli troops into west Beirut — not to fight, but to take control of key junctions\nand vantage points and keep basic order.\n\nBut the question obviously on everyone’s mind was how to make sure the\nsituation remained under control. It was early afternoon when we reached an\nIsraeli command post in the largely Palestinian southwest part of the city. It was\nset up by Amos Yaron, the former paratroop commander whose division had\nlanded by sea at the start of the invasion and was part of the push north to the\ncapital. At his side was Amir Drori, the head of the northern command. They\nhad set up a rooftop observation post just a few hundred yards in from where I\nhad landed with my Sayeret Matkal team a decade earlier for the Rue Verdun\noperation. It overlooked a pair of Palestinian refugee camps: Sabra and, a\ncouple of hundred yards closer to us, Shatila.\n\nRaful was with us as well. So was Moshe Levy, the deputy chief-of-staff,\nand Uri Saguy, the head of the operations branch in the kirya. I listened rather\nthan spoke. All I could gather from the other generals’ conversation was that\nthey were trying to figure out how to handle the Palestinian camps. No one\nexplicitly mentioned the idea of Israeli troops going in, presumably because\nthey realized that, far from helping ensure order, that might well inflame things\nfurther. Even Raful, at least in my earshot, made no reference to the “several\nthousand” PLO fighters that he and Arik still wanted out of Beirut. The only\nnote that struck me as odd was a general agreement that the Phalangists had not\nbeen carrying their load of the fighting during the war. One comment in\nparticular stuck with me, though I didn’t take it as referring to the Palestinian\ncamps in particular. I can’t remember which general said it, only that everyone\nseemed to agree: “Why the hell do we have to do their fighting for them?”\n\nIt was not until the next morning, back in Tel Aviv, that the alarm bells rang\nfor me, and by then it turned out to be too late. It was Friday, the eve of the\nJewish New Year. Yet in the wake of Gemayel’s assassination, the kirya was\n\n205\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_011676\n"}}}

This means a small teaching load since the best professors\nteach the least. Three semester-long courses in a year is a light load at\na big state university.\n\nYou might wonder, as an outsider to the ins and outs of the uni-\nversity, why the best professors teach the least. You also might wonder\nwhy I knew the types of courses he would teach and what I mean by\nthat. I will explain.\n\nTo start this explanation, it is important to understand why pro-\nfessors are “rewarded” with light teaching loads. (Note the word load.\nThis is the normal way this is discussed in a university.) I was given\nan extraordinarily light load at Northwestern for two reasons. One\nreason was that universities, like baseball teams, recruit so-called “su-\nperstars” (yes, that is how they are referred to in the university) from\ncompetitors. So Northwestern had to beat Yale’s offer in my case. At\nYale I taught one semester-long course per year, so Northwestern sim-\nply made me a better offer.\n\nThe reason both of these universities would even consider such a\nlight load is that I earned money for the university. As I used to tell\nmy children when they asked “why” questions, in the end it is usually\nabout money.\n\nI was recruited by Northwestern (in 1988), but I was really being\nrecruited by Andersen Consulting. They offered Northwestern (that is,\nthey offered me if I came to Northwestern) $30 million (over a 10-year\nperiod). Yes, that’s right, $30 million. I think you can see that North-\nwestern didn’t really care what I taught or when I taught it. They\nwanted that money. And, they also wanted the prestige.\n\nBefore I go too much further, I need to explain the prestige thing\nbecause it is very important. In fact, the prestige issue for professors\nand universities is precisely the root of the problem in our education\nsystem. This will take some time to explain, so let me start simply for\nnow.\n\nWhen Harvard plays Yale in football, they are battling for prestige.\nBut the battle may not be on the field exactly. The real battle is in\nhow powerful and important the alumni who attend the game have\nbecome and how big their respective endowments have become and\nwho has the best chemistry department or business school. It is a real\nbattle. The battle is for reputation. And, although it may seem silly to\ntake this battle seriously, it is taken very seriously. There is no World\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_023935\n"}}}

Such methods will bring key challenges to democracy.\n\nCHALLENGES AHEAD WITH Al, PROPOGANDA, AND PERSUASION\n\nData-centric analyses have been long used in marketing, advertising, and campaigning over\ndecades. However, over the past few years, we have seen the rise of the use of more powerful\ntools, including machine learning and inference aimed at algorithmic manipulation, with the target\nof influencing the thinking and actions of people. Some initial uses of these methods reportedly\nplayed a role in influencing the outcome of recent US presidential elections, as well as the\nelections in 2008 and 2012. We can expect to see an upswing in methods that manipulate states of\ninformation in a personalized automated manner. These systems can be designed and deployed as\nomnipresent/persistent, and aimed at specific goals for group- or person-centric persuasion.\n\nAs our data and models of how people consume and act on information improve, and as an\nincreasing portion of information consumption is mediated through digital systems managed by\npotentially opaque algorithms, it becomes increasingly conceivable that the information ecosystem\nwould get captured by malicious actors deploying increasingly advanced tools to control, shape,\nforge and personalize information, from ads to news reports.\n\nMachine learning, in conjunction with active learning, expected value decision making, and\noptimization of allocations of key resources, such as dollars or human effort, can be targeted at\nmonitoring, understanding, and then working to influence the beliefs and actions of large\npopulations of people. Data can be collected from large-scale populations, across multiple devices\nand services, and used to make inferences about the psychologies and beliefs of people, and for\ndesigning and guiding persuasive flows of sequences of information. Uses of Al can include\nattempts to optimize stealthiness of the interventions.\n\nIn the future, a great deal of the information consumed by citizens on personal devices is subject\nto alteration by information-engineers at media corporations and governmental propaganda\noffices, such that outside a few key positions of power no one really knows what is going on in the\nworld. There is a danger of the growth of domination over time of large populations by a single\ndominant or a few systems.

Better still, from an economist’s viewpoint if not an\naccountant’s, is to trust logic. Capital is present value of expected cash flow. Its loss\nof value with time, under simplifying assumptions, is the present value of the most\ndistant and most discounted cash flow.

I think they've done a very good job of\npolicing themselves to really make sure that people including the British National Front\nand others were not included in the party, and I think you’ve seen that also with tea party\ngroups, where some people would show up and were kind of marginal members of the tea\nparty, and the tea party did a great job of policing themselves early on. And I think that’s\nwhy when you hear charges of racism against the tea party, it doesn’t stick with the\nAmerican people, because they really understand.\n\nI think when you look at any kind of revolution — and this is a revolution — you always\nhave some groups that are disparate.

The flyers talk about how cool it would be to vacation anywhere in the world, zip to work or\nschool, or have fun soaring like an eagle. The invisibility types talk about sneaking into stores and taking\nclothes or music they like, eavesdropping on conversations, and playing tricks on family members and\nfriends. What is even more interesting about these particular answers is how they divide into pure\nhedonism — flying — and pure vice — invisibility. With invisibility you can take risks at no cost, except\nfor the cost that soon becomes apparent to many of these newly donned superheroes: even if they don’t\nget caught, they still did something bad, morally bad. This ratchets up their guilt. With this realization,\nand a dip into the dark side, comes an about face, with some picking flying instead of invisibility. Rarely\ndo people stick with invisibility, but see how they might deploy their power for virtuous purposes. Rarely\ndo these superheroes realize that they can be real heroes, using their invisibility to gain covert information\nabout terrorist organizations, elicit drug traders, pedophilic priests, or abusive parents — minus the risks.\n\nIn real life, there are risks associated with every decision, some clear from the start and others\nonly clear in hindsight. As with self-control, a growing body of evidence shows that there are individual\ndifferences in risk-taking: some are risk-averse, some risk-prone, and some seemingly risk-blind, unaware\nthat they are taking risks at all. Some of these differences are evident early in life. Some of these\ndifferences are strongly associated with crime later in life. Some of these differences provide insights into\nthe invisible risks that individuals and societies confront, risks that can cause great harms.\n\nResearch on clinical populations with antisocial disorders, most notably those with a clinical\ndiagnosis of psychopathy, reveals a major cause of their high risk, costly, and violent behavior: a failure\nto experience fear, anxiety, or stress in response to highly evocative images and sounds. In contrast with\nhealthy populations, psychopaths are emotionally blasé about the things in the world that can cause harm\nor result in punishment. The problem lies in the fact that psychopaths, both adults and those identified as\ncandidates early in childhood, fail to learn about the dangers in life. Their failure to learn is caused by a\nreduction in size and activity of two critical and connected brain areas: a region of the frontal cortex and\nthe amygdala. When this system works efficiently, it allows individuals to learn about the sounds, smells,\nand sights that are associated with bad things in the world. When this system works well, individuals\nlearn to avoid antisocial, immoral, and illegal acts by developing anxiety and fear over the possibility of\npunishment and personal injury. When this system works poorly, as is the case in psychopaths,\nindividuals act as if there are no dangers or risks of punishment — a disposition that enables inappropriate\nactions. But psychopathy covers a broad spectrum, with problems that all of us confront at some point in\nour lives, some of us even repeatedly. This is important as it forces us to look at non-clinical populations\nfor the causes of individual differences in risk-taking, especially our reactivity to dangerous events.\n\nStudies carried out over several decades, in a wide variety of cultures, reveal that children begin\n\nlife with distinctive temperaments. Some are mellow, blasé about events that are startling to many.\n\nHauser Chapter 4.

He's a special guy.\" \nBut when asked by reporters about Cinque in May, Trump denied knowing anything about him or his criminal \npast. \n\"If a guy's going to give you an award, you take it,\" the President-elect said at the time. \"You don't tend to look \nup his whole life story.\" \nThe Trump transition team did not immediately return a request for comment on how the President-elect knows \nCinque or why they appeared together Saturday. \nWhile standing alongside Cinque, Trump also took a moment to address the terror attack that left scores of \nnightclub revelers in Istanbul dead over the weekend — and how the bloodbath somehow necessitates a \nMexican border wall. \n\"We will build a wall, you know that. We will build a wall,\" the President-elect told the raucous crowd. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 033210 \n\"And speaking of walls,\" he continued. \"In Turkey tonight — has anybody heard? Big disaster took place in \nTurkey tonight. Many, many, many people killed...It's a horror show. So we're going to get things running \nproperly.\" \nISIS claimed responsibility for the Saturday attack  , which left at least 39 people dead and dozens more \nwounded, calling the lone gunman who carried out the massacre a \"heroic soldier of the caliphate.\" The suspect  \nhad yet to be named and located by Turkish authorities early Tuesday. \nThe President-elect made building a wall along the country's southern border one of his main campaign talking \npoints, frequently promising his supporters that it will be a \"great\" and \"beautiful\" wall. \nBut his pledge to construct a border barrier has gone under several renditions, with the President-elect admitting \nin November that it might actually end up \"part wall, part fence.\"  \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 033211 \n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

These are the dimensions associated with emotion, and when taken away, cause us to\nperceive the other as an object. Since objects can’t feel pain or joy, we can’t share in their experience\nbecause they lack experience altogether. If that is the case, then when we perceive any human group that\nhas been dehumanized in this particular way, there should be little to no activity in those areas of the brain\nassociated with thinking, feeling, wanting, and believing. To explore this possibility, the social\npsychologist Susan Fiske placed subjects in a brain scanner and presented photographs of either extreme\nout-group members, such as the homeless and drug addicts, or photographs of other groups such as the\nelderly, middle-class Americans, and the rich. When viewing the extreme out-group, not only did Fiske\nsee little activity in an area critically related to self-awareness and the process of thinking about others\nthoughts and emotions — the medial prefrontal cortex — but she also observed an intense increase of\nactivity in the insula, a brain area that is recruited when we experience disgust.\n\nFiske’s results highlight the dangers of dehumanization. Once we turn off areas of the brain that\nare involved in thinking about others’ thoughts and emotions, and turn on areas involved in disgust, we\nhave set ourselves up for moral disengagement. As the distinguished American psychologist Albert\nBandura has documented through decades of research, moral disengagement allows people to justify harm\nby transforming lethal motives into morally justified and even benevolent ones. Moral disengagement\nallows us to excuse ourselves from moral responsibility, either disregarding the harm imposed or\nconvincing ourselves that it was justified, even obligatory. In several international studies of school-aged\nchildren, results consistently show that those who are most morally disengaged are most likely to engage\nin various forms of aggression, including bullying and repeated criminal offenses. These same children\nare also least likely to engage in helpful behavior, revealing that moral disengagement dispenses with the\ntypical process of self-censure and sanctioning that we carry around when we are morally engaged. Ina\nstudy of American prison personnel involved in death penalty sentences, executioners were more morally\ndisengaged than support staff or prison guards. Executioners were more likely to dehumanize the\nconvicted prisoner and provide moral and economic justifications. Executioners also felt less guilt\nbecause they had developed a narrative to justify their actions, one that ascribed complete fault and\nresponsibility to the victim. Support staff flipped in the opposite direction, fully involved with the\nweighty moral issues associated with ending someone’s life. In a study of people’s political attitudes,\nthose with strong right wing authoritarian views, commonly associated with fascism and submission to\nauthority, were more likely to support war by means of morally disengaging. In particular, they were most\n\nlikely to support war by justifying its necessity and trivializing the harm that will necessarily arise — for\n\nHauser Chapter 3.

The freeze would not be open-\nended, but last for 10 months, as a way of boosting the effort to restart\nnegotiations. It would apply to new construction, not work already underway. And\nit would exclude the post-1967 neighborhoods inside the expanded city limits of\nJerusalem. Like his other moves, it was also dismissed as insignificant by the\nPalestinians. Though there was a formal restarting of the talks, they went almost\nnowhere during the period of the freeze, which Bibi cited as a reason for not\nextending it further. From then on, the negotiations produced even less. I didn’t\nbuy the narrative that this was entirely Bibi’s fault. Abu Mazen remained\nsteadfastly, deliberately passive. Obviously not inclined to take the risk of further\nwidening his rift with Hamas in Gaza, he was content to echo the Obama\nadministration’s argument that nothing could happen until there was a settlement\nfreeze. Once the freeze was announced, he went through the motions, avoiding all\nthe difficult issues, in the expectation Washington would ensure the freeze was\nrenewed. President Obama’s initial Mideast moves had made it much easier for\nAbu Mazen to avoid any serious engagement. In contrast to past presidents, Obama\nhad placed almost all of the onus for progress on Israel. But the end result also\nsuited Bibi. Though I never entirely gave up hope of persuading him it was in\nIsrael’s interest to seek a resolution of our conflict with the Palestinians, it became\nmore evident as the months went on that his aim was simply to keep things ticking\nover, and avoid any major new crisis.\n\nHe appointed an old personal friend — a corporate lawyer named Yitzhak\nMolcho — as our negotiator.

We spoke in detail about the state of the\nnegotiations. With Molcho still in the room, I phoned Bibi in Jerusalem on the\nsecure phone line. I said I’d just been updated on the talks, and it seemed clear\nthere were a number of suggestions Israel could make, with no domestic political\nrisk but with every prospect of improving the atmosphere and accelerating\nprogress. “Yitzhak is one of Israel’s top lawyers,” I said. “He’s struck dozens of\ndeals in his life. But he strikes a deal when that’s what his client wants. You are the\nclient. If you tell him: bring me back the best deal you can — not a peace treaty, just\na deal on a specific issue — he’ Il do it. But if his brief is simply to negotiate, he can\ngo on negotiating forever.

Here, she reports on the\nHollywood glamour, excitement and social\nshenanigans, including celebrating with\nColin Firth, Jesse Eisenberg, Elton John,\nOprah Winfrey and many more.\nphotographs by PATRICK MCMULLAN\nQaddafi is hunkering\ndown in Tripoli, giving\npress interviews, denying\nthat rebels are taking\nover Eastern Libya. Oil\nprices are shooting up over one hundred\ndollars a barrel. The U.S. government is on the\nverge of a shutdown. These are not the topsecret\nopening lines of Aaron Sorkin’s new\nscript, but the global headlines of a world\nspinning out of control as I head to Los\nAngeles like an overdressed lemming to attend\nthe 83rd Academy Awards and attempt to\nmake sense of artists thrust into combat.\nFor the second year, nearly 6,000 Academy\nmembers have nominated 10 films and the\nbattle seems to be pared down to 2. The\nbeloved instant classic, The King’s Speech,\nmarches into the arena as the frontrunner, but\npassionate supporters of the edgier (critics’\ndarling) The Social Network have not conceded.\nThe ballots are counted, the party invites are\nout and still the feelings are raw. Nominees are\nexhausted from campaigning.\nWoody Allen and George Lucas tell me they\nare no longer members of the Academy\nbecause pitting artists against each other to\ndetermine the quality of their work is insane.\nThey are right. My event and publicity company\nis considered Switzerland by the studios, as\nwe help every filmmaker to present his work.\nHowever, this year, against my better judgment,\nI am somewhat emotionally sucked in.\nIn 2005, I met the unknown 32-year-old\nEnglish director Tom Hooper on his first film\nfor HBO, Elizabeth I starring Helen Mirren.\nHelen later wins an Oscar for portraying\nQueen Elizabeth in The Queen. Queen\nElizabeth is the daughter of King George VI,\nportrayed by Oscar-winner Colin Firth in The\nKing’s Speech directed by Hooper. No degrees\nof separation.\nAt the Telluride Film Festival, Tom Hooper\nbathed in the glory of a hysterical standing\novation alongside Colin Firth and Geoffrey\nRush at the very first public screening of that\nfilm. Two weeks later at The Toronto Film\nFestival, Harvey Weinstein stood with his\nfilmmakers witnessing the same reaction. The\nfilm won The Audience Prize. Their strategy\nwas to say nothing, do nothing. They have a\npossible Oscar winner—four out of five past\nBest Pictures have premiered in Toronto.\nCut to New York City at the end of\nSeptember. It’s opening night at The Film\nSociety of Lincoln Center. One of America’s most important\nand prolific producers, Scott Rudin, along with Jesse\nEisenberg, Andrew Garfield and Aaron Sorkin, are in a\nbrightly lit box waving down to their equally hysterical\naudience who have just seen The Social Network. The film\nopens the next day to rave reviews and endless publicity.\nDavid Fincher is off making The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo.\nAaron Sorkin becomes the face of the film and an immediate\nshoo-in for the adapted screenplay Oscar.\nThe Hamptons International Film Festival in October\nsuddenly becomes a launching pad for 127 Hours, where\nstar-cum-Yale/NYU student James Franco appears. More\nOscar buzz. Producer/director Danny Boyle (Oscar winner for\nSlumdog Millionaire) stays in London all fall directing the play\nFrankenstein. Black Swan also unspools there in a tiny theater as\nMadonna, Alec Baldwin and Harvey Weinstein slip in the\nback. Darren Aronofsky is hailed a genius. Natalie Portman is\ninstantly the hot nominee for Best Actress. Both films are sensations,\nbut it’s The King’s Speech that wins The Audience Prize.\nMid-November: David O. Russell and Mark Wahlberg\nsneak The Fighter in Manhattan. As their audience erupts in\ncheers, I tell producer/actor Wahlberg, “Clint Eastwood is\ngoing to kill himself for not directing this.” He says, “You’re\nwrong. He turned it down because he’s done it. He’s seen it\nand he loves it.” David O. Russell becomes my new Clint\nEastwood. Christian Bale and Melissa Leo are hailed the\nsupporting actors to beat.\nTrue Grit, directed by the Coen Brothers and also produced\nby Scott Rudin, finally throws its cowboy hat in the ring in\nmid-December at the Ziegfeld as the last serious Oscar\ncontender for Best Picture. It gallops off to box office gold.\nThe Social Network now cements its battle cry with one\nword: relevance. Mark Zuckerberg lands on the cover of\nTime Magazine as “Person of the Year.” A smart and extensive\nad campaign positions the film in the lead. Critics and\npundits proclaim the race is over. Everyone goes on holiday.\nThis is one of the few times in Harvey Weinstein’s life that\nhe’s caught off guard. He quickly mobilizes an inner team of\n15 and conducts strategy meetings 7 days a week, including\nChristmas. They’re like a Chinese restaurant: always open. He\nsends screenwriter David Seidler and Tom Hooper to every\ncorner of the country doing Q&As until they are both blue in\nthe face from “finding their voice.” SAG voters begin seeing\nthe film two and three times.\nIn January at the Golden Globes, about 88 foreign journalists\ngive awards to The Social Network for Best Drama, Director\nand Screenplay. The film is still perceived as the Oscar winner\nand nobody can stop the steamroller. Only Academy voters\ndisregard these awards.\nThe King’s Speech wins the PGA in L.A. Everyone is totally\nsurprised when Tom Hooper goes on to win the DGA. After\na tremendous amount of hard work by team Weinstein, the\nactors win for the SAG Ensemble. The BAFTAs reinforced\ntheir lead; the film is now the frontrunner. It takes the media\na few weeks to catch on.\nEmma\nStone\nCollin Firth and\nAnne Hathaway\nGwyneth\nPaltrow\nSandra\nBullock\nTom Hooper\nCarolina\nHerrera\n\nJennifer\nLawrence\nMarisa\nTomei\nLeslie Mann\nand Judd\nApatow\nMelissa\nLeo\nSteve\nMartin\nSteven\nTyler and\nLiv Tyler\nGeorge Hamilton and\nKimberly Blackford\nKevin\nSpacey\nL’Wren\nScott and\nMick\nJagger\nI whisper to Harrison\n[Ford], “That looks just like\nJohnny Depp.” Harrison rolls\nhis eyes and reluctantly\nintroduces me to his\nfriend . . . Johnny Depp.\nThe Daily Mail announces Her Royal Highness Queen\nElizabeth has enjoyed a private screening of The King’s\nSpeech and is “moved” by the film. With no proof the Queen\nhas actually seen the film, press agents send out a global press\nrelease thanking her Majesty for the endorsement.\nFRIDAY, FEBRUARY 24\nMid-day, I arrive at The Beverly Hills Hotel. As the housekeepers\nunpack my bags upstairs I peek into the Polo Lounge\nand find Warren Beatty in a booth. I tell him I’m rooting for\nhis wife, Annette Benning, and love her film, The Kids Are All\nRight. Warren says The Social Network will win.\nThis year I am two days late arriving to Oscar weekend. I\nam shown to a very, very small room—the size of a broom\ncloset. Uncharacteristically, I have a slight melt down. I am\nmoved. The housekeepers run down the hall with my clothes\nflying. The hotel is sold out, so I get someone else’s room.\nAnother unsuspecting victim checking in downstairs will get\nthe broom closet.\nIt is cold, grey and rainy. Taffeta, organdy and embroidered\nsilk evening clothes hang in my closet. I stay in my sweaters\nand fur coat, and head to Arianna Huffington’s home in\nBeverly Hills where she and Wendi Murdoch are hosting a\nparty for Tom Freston’s wife, the beautiful, blonde Kathy.\nHer book is called Veganist: Lose Weight, Get Healthy, Change\nthe World—perfect for monks.\nArianna has just sold the Huffington Post to AOL for $315\nmillion dollars and is rumored to have personally landed\naround $20 million. She is euphoric as she greets Nicole\nKidman and Keith Urban at the door. Other drenched power\nplayers include Disney’s Bob Iger and wife Willow Bay,Fox’s\nJim Gianopulos, Candice Bergen and journalist daughter\nChloe Malle, Google’s Eric Schmidt, Oliver Stone escorting\nhis daughter Tara and avoiding questions about Charlie\nSheen, Moby, Jamie Niven, Brian Grazer, Vivi Nevo, CBS’s\nLes Moonves and Julie Chen, Rob Reiner, Paramount’s Brad\nGrey and fiancé Cassandra Huysentruyt and Jeff Bezos.\nHors d’oeuvres include pigs in blankets—a food group not\nmentioned in Kathy’s book.\nThe action migrates to UTA Jim Burkus’ home for a party\nfor True Grit’s Ethan and Joel Coen. I pass Ron Howard on\nthe way in and he says, “Keep me on your list.” Is he kidding?\nSunrise and Mark Ruffalo, Focus Feature’s James Shamus,\nNancy Meyers and John Goldwyn mingle. Adorable Hallie\nSteinfeld is there with her parents. I am trying to fix her up\nwith Justin Bieber. She giggles, “Peg, I am only 14.”\nI am face to face with Harrison Ford and stupidly tell him\nI love him in Morning Glory. He’s looking at me in utter\ndisbelief, but I will not shut up. A gorgeous guy is inches away\nin a hat and glasses. I whisper to Harrison, “That looks just\nlike Johnny Depp.” Harrison rolls his eyes and reluctantly\nintroduces me to his friend . . . Johnny Depp. I babble a bit\nabout his great work then run for cover in a corner next to my\nbuddy, Jerry Bruckheimer.\nI head over to the CAA/Bryan Lourd’s “Friday Night\nParty.” Torrential rains and horrific winds cause a traffic jam\nthat makes it impossible to get near the house. The world’s\nmost famous faces cower under black umbrellas and make a\nrun for it. Bryan Lourd and Bruce Bozzi receive friends at the\ndoor all night.\nInside, Uma Thurman tells me she finally moved into a\ndoorman building in New York after being terrorized by\nstalkers for years. Ben Walker talks about Abraham Lincoln:\nVampire Hunter, which he is about to shoot, while his fiancé,\nMamie Gummer, looks sexy shivering in a white satin gown.\nProducer Jon Kilik mentions he oversaw a new cut of Julian\nSchnabel’s Miral, to be released in March. Bennett Miller,\nstanding with Kristin Gore, says Sony loves his new film,\nMoneyball, and Brad Pitt is terrific. (When is Brad Pitt not\nterrific?) Sandy Gallin tells me he has an actual job\ndecorating Jeffrey Katzenberg’s home. I congratulate Barry\nLevinson’s son Sam, a director, for winning the writing\naward at Sundance for his first film, Another Happy Day.\nAlso seen floating around are Taylor Swift and Jake\nGyllenhaal—but not together—Sean Penn, Tom Cruise and\nKatie Holmes, Anderson Cooper, Hilary Swank, Kelly Ripa,\nPaul Haggis, Marisa Tomei, Kate Beckinsale, Demi Moore\nand Ashton Kutcher, Kate Hudson, Gerard Butler, Renee\nZellweger with Bradley Cooper, Biutiful director Alejandro\nGonzalez-Inarritu, Kathryn Bigelow and Mark Boal, Ellen\nBarkin (who is headed to Broadway in The Normal Heart this\nspring) and CAA’s Kevin Huvane, Richard Lovett and Hylda\nQueally. Sony Classic’s Michael Barker tells me The Social\nNetwork will win.\nTired celebs try to go home, but limo lock is at a standstill.\nCell phones don’t work in the area. Two hundred swells\nbecome party prisoners and happily hang out till 5 a.m.\nSATURDAY, FEBRUARY 26\nOut comes the sun and dries up all the rain. IAC chairmen\nand owner of Newsweek/The Daily Beast Barry Diller\nand his wife Diane Von Furstenberg (with her kids Alex\nand Tatiana) host their 15th annual lunch for Graydon\nCarter in their Coldwater Canyon home. Barry introduces\nme to his star guest, Gov. Jerry Brown, just elected to his\nthird (nonconsecutive) term as California governor.\nLike last year, enormous clear plastic tents are erected\non the hill near the house. Long wooden picnic tables sit\non oriental rugs covering the soggy ground. VIPs wears\nwinter clothes, comfy sweaters and sensible shoes. I arrive\nin a fur coat.\nStephen Gaghan and\nMinnie Mortimer\nScarlett\nJohansson\nCharlize\nTheron\nLourdes Leon\nand Madonna\nArmie\nHammer\nKate\nBeckinsale\nAaron Sorkin\n\nGeorgina\nChapman\nHilary\nSwank\nCameron\nDiaz\nWendi Murdoch, Kathy Freston and\nArianna Huffington\nNatalie Portman\nBrian Grazer and Jeff Bezos\nTom\nFord\nEverybody knows everybody, and it doesn’t matter if\nyou have a hit film or T.V. show this season. Oprah\nWinfrey kisses David Geffen, casually chats with former\nDisney C.E.O. Michael Eisner and current Sony Chief Sir\nHoward Stringer and Rob Weisenthal. Brett Ratner\narrives with his houseguest Jean Pigozzi, who is allowed to\ntake photographs. Graydon greets people with chic wife\nAnna by his side.\nIngrid Sischy and Sandy Brant, Rupert Murdoch,\nRon Meyer, Francesco Clemente with his twin boys and\nTom Ford chat each other up. People to watch include\npregnant Victoria and David Beckham with Lynn\nWyatt, Fran Lebowitz, Larry Gagosian and Shala\nMonroque, Ben Silverman, Debbie and Allen\nI head over to the CAA/Bryan\nLourd’s “Friday Night Party.”\nTorrential rains and horrific\nwinds cause a traffic jam that\nmakes it impossible to get\nnear the house. The world’s\nmost famous faces cower\nunder black umbrellas and\nmake a run for it.\nGrubman, Sotheby’s Tobias Meyer and Mark Fletcher and\nStephen Gaghan and Mini Mortimer wearing her oversized\ncat glasses.\nBruce Cohen has invited me to the Oscar broadcast\nrehearsal. Inside the Kodak Theater’s massive auditorium,\nI find a seat next to his proud parents. I\nwatch Josh Brolin and Javier Bardem come out in\nwhite dinner jackets and flub their lines as they\npretend to present Best Adapted Screenplay and\nBest Original Screenplay. Josh will later tell me\nthat their acting methods are completely opposite:\nhe’s a quick study and is very creative and\ncomfortable ad-libbing; Javier, whose mother\ntongue is Spanish, likes to have every syllable\nprinted out to study with a dialect coach. Life-size\nphotos on cardboard plaques are taped to each\nnominee’s chair. I memorize their location so when I\nreturn Sunday I can quickly kiss them all.\nBack at the Beverly Hills hotel I slip into my black\ntulle Dennis Basso cocktail dress with a plunging\nneckline and put on my mother’s jewels. Jim\nColeman takes me to the “Night Before Party” in the\nhotel. This is Jeffrey Katzenberg’s 9th annual A-lister event\nbenefiting The Motion Picture & Television Fund where they\nraise $6.5 million dollars in 1 night. I walk into Valentino,\nwho gives me an approving once-over. I tell him and\nGiancarlo Giammetti that Woody Allen’s new film,\nMidnight in Paris, is opening the Cannes Film Festival and\nthey must bring the yacht.\nElton John and David Furnish join our conversation so of\ncourse we ask for intimate details about baby Zachary. I\nsegue over to Amy Adams, who, like them, mentions she\nhates leaving her baby in the hotel room. Next stop is Kate\nCapshaw in a black bowler hat chatting with Steven\nSpielberg’s god-daughter, Gwyneth Paltrow. I have known\nSteven for years (in 1982 I was a publicist on E.T.). I now tell\nhim I’m going to the Lincoln Center opening of War Horse\nwith Kathy Kennedy and Frank Marshall and cannot wait to\nsee his movie version.\nI meet sweet Jennifer Aniston, her new haircut and her\nperfect little body. Her date tells me her secret is a half-hour\non the treadmill everyday—such an understatement. I tell\nJesse Eisenberg I was on his plane home from the Baftas last\nweek, but he was hiding under his hoodie. He says innocently,\n“You should have said ‘hello.’ I always cover my head because\nI think my curls make me look like a girl.”\nThe charity gives us a coupon booklet redeemable at\nvarious booths. Rich people run around like lunatics, collecting\ngifts for their housekeepers. Among the shoppers are\nSteven and Heather Mnuchin, Viacom’s Deborah and\nPhilippe Dauman, Tamara Mellon, Christine Taylor and\nBen Stiller, Cate Blanchet, Susan and Robert Downey Jr.\nand Debra and Hugh Jackman.\nNext stop is The Weinstein Company’s party at the Soho\nHouse sponsored by MontBlanc. Long gone are the funky\nMiramax Saturday night soirees where nominees spoofed\ntheir own films in homemade costumes and ad-libbed\nhilarious skits. No more grown men dressed as Anna Paquin\nplaying the piano in hopes of winning a Max Award.\nAs I come in, a 400-pound gorilla refuses to let me on the\nelevator. Once on, I see Jennifer Lopez in the corner and\nremind her we met on Len Blavatnik’s yacht in Cannes. She\ngraciously pretends to remember me. Her manager, Benny\nMedina, is kicking me.\nI slip into Colin Firth’s booth to have a tête-à-tête with him\nand his wife Livia Giuggioli. Jokingly, I suggest he say “I’m\nspeechless” when he wins. Colin patiently assures me many\npeople, far more clever than I, thought of this. He then says that\nothers are waging bets on whether he might subconsciously\nstutter. I grill him about his wardrobe, assuming he will be\nwearing a new Tom Ford tuxedo. He tells me both he and\nFord will be in older Ford models. I tell him I made rich-butthrifty\nCharles Ferguson, director of Inside Job, spend $6,000\ndollars for a new Tom Ford tux.\nIn the back room, Jennifer Lopez is now seated with\nWeinstein’s wife, Georgina Chapman. Helena Bonham\nCarter, her live-in-lover Tim Burton and her mother Elena\ncirculate. Star power includes Adrien Brody, Mary-Kate\nand Ashley Olsen, Cameron Diaz, Camilla Belle, Chace\nVera\nFarmiga\nAdrien\nBrody\nAndrew\nGarfield\nOliver Stone and Tara Stone\nClaire Danes and\nHugh Dancy\nHailee\nSteinfeld\nTaylor\nSwift\n\nDonald and Melania Trump\nDonna\nKaran\nLynn\nWyatt\nBarry\nDiller\nJon Hamm and\nJennifer Westfeldt\nAnderson\nCooper\nChloe Malle and\nCandice Bergen\nDiane von\nFurstenberg\nTory\nBurch\nCrawford, Claire Danes and Hugh Dancy, Darren\nAronofsky, director John Wells, Kerry Washington, Piers\nMorgan, Rachel Zoe, Sean Parker, Zack Braff and Leonardo\nDicaprio with Bar Rafaeli. Speech filmmakers are functioning\non high anxiety.\nSUNDAY, FEBRUARY 27\nProducer Donna Gigliotti is my date to the awards. We are\nboth so nervous we arrive at the Kodak Theater at 3 p.m. and\nnobody is there. We are driven around for an hour. When we\narrive back at the world’s most famous red carpet, I guide\nDonna through security check-in to the extreme right to\nmake sure we get on camera. I teach her the red carpet\nhustle, which is five steps forward, three steps back, one inch\nbehind a couture-clad nominee. We greet Kevin Huvane as\nSandra Bullock is talking to ABC-TV and a billion people see\nme wearing a black Marchesa gown. Five steps forward, three\nsteps back, we next meet Gwyneth Paltrow, and I hook up the\nback of her dress while another billion people see me correct\nthe fashion malfunction. Five steps forward, three steps back,\nwe’re now posing behind Nicole Kidman and Keith Urban.\nOur Blackberrys begin buzzing; the world has seen us.\nJames Franco and Anne Hathaway are hip hosts. This is the\nyear of no surprises. But it isn’t until Hilary Swank yells out\nHooper’s name for Best Director that Harvey’s gang finally\nrealizes they are getting the Oscar for Best Picture after all.\nHarvey is sitting in Spielberg’s seat as Spielberg announces\nthe win from the stage. Producers Iain Canning, Emile\nSherman and Gareth Unwin leap up and kiss each other.Six\nmonths of grueling work have finally paid off.

The invitation features a gold hologram that transmits\na radio frequency of a photo and details about the\nguest to VF staff as they arrive. The next day “Page Six” will\nreport that the backup private security firm is run by a\nformer Israeli operative, when in fact they are Irish\nCatholics from Staten Island.\nThere’s a hierarchy of arrival times. At 5 p.m. the inner\ncircle of Graydon’s 141 best friends attend a seated dinner.\nThey include Barry Diller and Diane von Furstenberg,\nFrancis Ford Coppola, Jon Hamm and Jennifer Westfeldt,\nBetsey Bloomingdale, Tory Burch and Lyor Cohen,\nCarolina and Reinaldo Herrera, L’Wren Scott and Sir\nMick Jagger, Naomi Watts and Liev Schreiber, Wendi\nStark, George Hamilton, Judd Apatow, Jackie and Joan\nCollins, Donna Karan and Steve Martin.\nThe best and the brightest talent in town arrive at 9 p.m.\nEvery single winner shows up.

I introduce Melania and Donald Trump\nto David O. Russell as The Trumpster gushes about The\nFighter. David tells Donald he used to be a waiter/bar tender\nat many of Trump’s parties. Donald smiles as if looking at yet\nanother apprentice. He then offers me a ride home on his\nplane; he’s leaving in 10 minutes. Too bad James Franco\ndidn’t know because he is presently sitting on a commercial\nflight back to school, skipping his own after-party. The rest of\nthe guests’ social standings are determined by half-hour\nincrements. VF’s Beth Kseniak, Matt Ullian and Jane Sarkin\ntell me the list is cut down to 800 this year.\nAt 11:30 p.m. there is another celebrity migration up the\nhill to Madonna manager Guy Oseary’s house.

Colin Firth, Tom Hooper\nand David Seidler show up at 4:30 a.m. at The Four\nSeasons Hotel for a live broadcast on “The Today Show.”\nFunctioning on an adrenalin rush, they return to the\nKodak Theater with Geoffrey Rush to appear on Oprah’s\nlive broadcast.\nBy the end of this year’s thrilling race between two\ngreat producers—Scott Rudin and Harvey Weinstein—\nFacebook and Twitter are credited for aiding political\njustice from the streets of Cairo to Tripoli.

The widening scope of the crisis, which\nincludes all parts of the world, confirms this unity and the common international pursuit. In addition, President\nObama’s public statement, which verifies that the United States cannot overcome the global crisis on its own, is\nfurther confirmation of the unity of the economy and the market. Other lessons learned from the=2 Ocrisis is\nrealizing the urgent need to develop the regulations, terms of reference and working mechanisms of\ninternational financial institutions to be commensurate with the unified markets and economies, and the\ninvolvement of many influential players.\n\nIn the United Arab Emirates, we perform a wide range of reviews through specialized federal and local\ncommittees which are well aware that within the challenges of the crisis, remain many opportunities.

Financials...\n\ne To analysts looking at USA Inc. as a public corporation, the financials are challenged\n\n- Excluding Medicare / Medicaid spending and one-time charges, USA Inc. has supported a 4% average net\nmargin’ over 15 years, but cash flow is deep in the red by negative $1.3 trillion last year (or\n-$11,000 per household), and net worth2 is negative $44 trillion (or -$371,000 per household).\n\ne The main culprits: entitlement programs, mounting debt, and one-time charges\n\n— Since the Great Depression, USA Inc. has steadily added “business lines” and, with the best of intentions,\ncreated various entitlement programs. Some of these serve the nation’s poorest, whose struggles have\nbeen made worse by the financial crisis. Apart from Social Security and unemployment insurance,\nhowever, funding for these programs has been woefully inadequate — and getting worse.\n\n- Entitlement expenses (adjusted for inflation) rose 70% over the last 15 years, and USA Inc. entitlement\nspending now equals $16,600 per household per year; annual spending exceeds dedicated funding by\nmore than $71 trillion (and rising). Net debt levels are approaching warning levels, and one-time charges\nonly compound the problem.\n\n- Some consider defense spending a major cause of USA Inc.'s financial dilemma. Re-setting priorities and\nstreamlining could yield savings — $788 billion by 2018, according to one recent study*® — perhaps without\ndamaging security. But entitlement spending has a bigger impact on USA Inc. financials. Although\ndefense nearly doubled in the last decade, to 5% of GDP, it is still below its 7% share of GDP from 1948 to\n2000. It accounted for 20% of the budget in 2010, but 41% of all government spending between 1789 and\n1930.\n\nNote: 1) Net margin defined as net income divided by total revenue; 2) net worth defined as assets (ex. stewardship assets like national\nparks and heritage assets like the Washington Monument) minus liabilities minus the net present value of unfunded entitlements (such as\nSocial Security and Medicare), data per Treasury Dept.'s “2010 Annual Report on the U.S. Government’, 3) Gordon Adams and Matthew\nLeatherman, “A Leaner and Meaner National Defense,” Foreign Affairs, Jan/Feb 2011)\nwww.kpcb.com\n\nUSA Inc. | Introduction 15\n\n...Drilldown on USA Inc.

A quick\nskim through the many blogs commenting on this work reveals a common refrain that makes the key\npoint: many that have taken this test, whether focusing on race, sexual orientation, or political affiliation,\nopine that the test must be invalid because they explicitly disavow any groupish biases. But that’s the\npoint! What we disavow explicitly has less impact than we would like on what we hold implicitly.\n\nIf our implicit system champions one view of racism and our explicit system another, then we are\ncontinuously faced with an epic conflict. To resolve this conflict, and enable the explicit system to emerge\ntriumphant, requires self-control, keeping the implicit system quiet. Studies of the brain provide\ninteresting insights into this process. Recall that when we experience conflict, regardless of its content,\nthere is activation in the anterior cingulate. When we exert self-control, regardless of content, there is\nactivation in particular regions within the prefrontal cortex. When we feel threatened by a dangerous\nanimal or person, there is activation in the amygdala. These three brain regions tell an interesting story\nabout how we process race. When Caucasian subjects view faces of Black as opposed to Caucasian\npeople staring at them, there is greater activation in the amygdala. This racial difference disappears if\nsubjects view photos of faces looking away or with eyes closed. It is the potentially threatening aspect of\na face staring at you that engages the racial difference. If you briefly flash faces at Caucasian subjects so\nthat they are unaware of them, there is stronger activation in the amygdala for Black than Caucasian\nfaces. But if you present the faces for long enough, allowing them to enter conscious awareness, the\namyegdala’s pattern of activity goes away, replaced instead by strong activation in the anterior cingulate\nand prefrontal cortex. Staring longer at someone from a different race triggers a sense of conflict and\nengages the system of self-control, pushing down our implicit racism to enable more explicit neutrality\nand equality.\n\nWhat this work shows is that understanding our attitudes and actions toward those of the same\nand different race requires consideration of implicit and explicit components. Think of this process like a\nhand pushing down on an automatic watering fountain. The machinery that produces the pressure to push\nwater out of the holes in the fountain operates without concern for what happens outside in the world. The\nhand that pushes down is under human control, consciously guided, perhaps with the aim of simply\nspreading the water or feeling its’ coolness on a hot day. Though the hand may try to control the\nmovement of the water, it may only do so to some extent, guided by the power of the automatic engine\nbelow. Thus, we have an automatic bottom up mechanism and a controlled top down mechanism. So it is\nwith race. The bottom up mechanism operates automatically, pushing forward our implicit prejudice. The\ntop down mechanism attempts to exert control, when and where it can, to avoid looking racist, sexist, or\n\nwhat have you. Somewhere, the two meet, creating a personality profile that is more explicitly racist,\n\nHauser Chapter 3.

Iam currently on a plane. I sent you earlier from the plane an email response to your letter, which\nIT hope you received. Regarding your note below: My earlier remark to you was based on my correspondence\n\nwith the universities during and after the investigation, and the conclusion I drew from the ANU report, which I\nquoted for you in my response to your note. The claims made in the allegation which were later demonstrated to\nbe false, or which were then not supported after repeated requests from the University to substantiate the claim,\n\nprovided evidence that the claim was fabricated (as I knew it must be), and therefore maliciously so.\n\nI had been planning on resigning my honorary appointment at ANU before I received the original letter from\nANU because my wife had moved to the US several years ago, and I no longer visited the University regularly\nto work with colleagues there as I did in earlier years. When I received the letter from ANU regarding the\ncomplaint, I decided to wait to resign my appointment until the investigation was completed and the complaint\nwas dismissed. After it was, I sent my note of resignation in, and I note that upon its receipt the Dean he\nsuggested I remain on until my appointment expired at the end of this year, but as I had made my decision to\nresign earlier I felt no need to wait until then. I received a very nice note from the director of the unit I work\nwith (who was made aware of the complaint and its resolution by the Dean) who expressed thanks for my many\ncontributions to the University while there, and my interactions with staff, students, and faculty there.\n\nI hope this clarifies your issues.\n\nLMK\n\nOn Dec 11, 2017, at 9:02 AM, Peter Aldhous ( wrote:\n\nDr. Krauss,\nSince sending the note below, we have heard from the Australian National University.

His message was among the simplest and most\ncompact and personal possible: The transmission of faith requires nothing more and\nnothing less than faith itself. Romans teaches us that believing in God, which is faith,\nis enough for access to all the riches of heaven: God’s righteousness, an afterlife,\nforgiveness.\n\nBy Luther’s age, however, access to those riches was not so simple. Among other\nthings, spiritual control had become a source of lucre for the church. The glory of the\nCatholic Church, her magnificent cathedrals and clothes, and her insidious habits of\nselling passes to heaven in the form of indulgences - this was a deployment of faith\nand power marked by a venality that grated against Luther’s from-faith-to-faith\nsensibility. When he saw his own congregation increasingly slipping away to\nchurches with priests who would do what he would not, which was to market and\nsell indulgences, he saw a rank, strange hypocrisy: The Church as an economic\ninstrument. His rage boiled over in the summer of 1517, and he summarized his\ncase against the Church in the 95 Theses that he nailed to the door of his local\nchurch on October 31s\". Papa non vult nec potest ullas penas remittere preter eas,\nquas arbitrio vel suo vel canonum imposuit, he wrote in Thesis Five: No matter what\nyou might pay him, the Pope can’t influence what happens to you after you die. Or,\nThesis 78, Euangelici rhetia sunt, quibus olim piscabantur viros divitiarum.\nIndulgences are nets with which one fishes for the riches of men.\n\nAs much as Luther was crying for a restoration of Saint Paul’s sense of a personal\nfaith, he was also starting a difficult and - for the Church - unpleasant argument\nabout power. Our relation to God, Luther meant, is our relation. It’s not something to\nbe brokered or sold or negotiated. It does not require fancy clothes or cathedrals or\nhierarchies. For Luther, this new logic had engendered a profound spiritual crisis.\nHe recalled, later in life, the very first time he’d encountered the possibility of direct\naccess to God, in the pages of Saint Augustine, probably around 1508. “When I came\nto the words ‘thee, most merciful father,” he wrote, “the thought that I had to speak\nto God without a mediator almost made me flee.”?! Who was he, Martin Luther, to\nspeak directly to God? But from then on, Luther’s experience of God, his own sense\nof power honestly passing from faith to faith - and not from faith to church to faith -\nembodied an extremely heretical idea about power: faith without a middleman.\n\nSuch a concept undid much of what had been taken as inarguable doctrine. The\nChurch immediately understood the danger. They rushed to label Luther as heretical\nand, later, crazy. In arguing that the Catholic Church, with all of its magnificent\ntrappings of faith, was really a useless toll gate, Luther was picking at a still larger,\nmore significant question: How should power be split? If Luther was right, and God\nshould be accessible directly to each of us, then some other questions tumbled after\nthat one. Should we have direct access to political power? To ideas? To money and\nland and control of our own economic destiny? Could “from faith to faith,” be recast\nas “from idea to idea” or “truth to truth” or - and this turned out to be the really\n\n91 “When I came to the words”: Preserved Smith, The Life and Letters of Martin\nLuther, (Boston: Houghton Mifflin, 1911) Introduction\n\n67\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_018299\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

The rest\nwere run of the mill criminal cases—murder, robbery, rape, assault and other street crimes. It\nwas a perfect combination for a budding law professor who was interested in constitutional and\ncriminal law.\n\nOur task began with a case record, which consisted of the appellate briefs filed by the lawyers and\nan “appendix,” which included relevant excerpts from the trial transcript and motions filed before\nthe trial court. Some records were relatively short, perhaps 300 pages in total. Others were\nhumongous, as many as 5,000 pages. Then there was the complete trial transcript—a verbatim\naccount of every word spoken during the trial, as well as during the pretrial and post-trial\nproceedings. Judge Bazelon would often ask me to read the entire transcript in search of errors\nor particular issues that were of interest to him.\n\nWhen we completed the review, we would discuss the case with the judge, who had read the\nbriefs and perused the appendix in preparation for the oral argument in court. Occasionally, we\nwere permitted to listen to the oral argument, especially when leading lawyers were arguing\n(which was rare), or when issues close to the judge’s heart were being considered. But generally,\nwe were required to remain in the chambers working while the judge presided over the oral\nargument.\n\nSince Bazelon was the Chief Judge, he always presided and got to assign the opinion to one of the\nthree judges on a panel (or nine when on rare occasions the entire court heard the case “en\nbanc”). Following the oral argument, there was a conference among the judges during which a\ntentative result was reached and the case assigned. Bazelon always assigned the most interesting\ncases to himself, or to a judge whose decisions he wanted to influence.\n\nWhen the conference was over and the case assigned, we would meet with the judge and he\nwould tell us which clerk was to work on the opinion. I always got the interesting cases (at least\nthe ones that interested the judge). My co-clerk, who the judge didn’t much like, got the dregs.\nThis was fine with him, since he didn’t much like working closely with the judge.\n\nThen the real work would begin. Draft after draft was submitted, marked up by the judge and\nrejected with the admonition, “You can do better,” or sometimes “start over, this draft isn’t\nright.”\n\nAfter many drafts, and some pressure from the other judges on the panel, the opinion was\nreleased to the public. Generally, they were majority opinions, often unanimous, but frequently\nthey were dissenting or concurring opinions. This was a deeply divided court and the dissenting\nopinions pulled no punches in criticizing the majority, and vice versa.\n\nAt the end of the year, the clerks would prepare bound volumes of all the opinions we worked on\nduring our clerkship. One was given to the judge and the others to us, as mementoes of our year.\nAs I write these words, I have in front of me the maroon volume engraved with the following\n\nwords:\n\n“Chief Judge David L.

In fact, France’s revolutionary age was only just beginning.\nThe fall of the Bastille was 18 months away; the flight and death of the King five\nyears off. Paris would soon see a time when one riot a year felt like peace. You can’t\nmiss in Jefferson’s letter, and in the others he exchanged with Madison that winter\nand the following spring, his instinct that the world was changing, that it was being\nriven by urgent new forces, and that America must be positioned for the fresh order\nboth internally and in her foreign policy. Jefferson knows what this new age\ndemands - liberty - and in that spirit he fires off suggestions for Madison. It is in this\nDecember, 1787 letter that he remarks that he “does not like” the absence of a “bill\nof rights”, a hint that led to an adjustment of historic import.\n\nIt is possible to regard the transformations of politics, economics and military affairs\nover the past centuries, the sorts of bold remakings that tore apart places like the\nBastille or built up instruments like the American Constitution, as emerging froma\nfew crucial periods, the sorts of historic turns that mark moments when power\nmakes an epochal shift. It is striking how, in passing through these periods of\nunthinkable change, America has benefited so much, so fully. The country was, to\nbegin with, born out of the social and political revolutions of the 18\" century. The\nnational liberation that pulled Jefferson from his Virginia farm and into politics was\nthe first of the great, revolutionary movements that convulsed and fractured a\ndozen European powers. France followed America, as did Germany and Italy and\nsoon most of the continent. “The boisterious sea of liberty,” Jefferson called the new\npolitical order*. It required a strong stomach. Tempests of accumulated social\npressures - the Reformation, the Enlightenment, the Scientific Revolution - had\npassed over one ancien regieme after another like powerful waves. America, begun\non fresh land and with new ideas inked onto clean paper, had a natural advantage in\nthe situation of her birth. “I think our government,” Jefferson concluded in his letter\nto Madison, “will remain virtuous for many centuries.”\n\nA second transformation of global order began in the middle of the 19 Century, as\nJefferson and Madison's age ended. Their period had largely been one of internal\nrevolutions, as the nations of Europe realigned their domestic orders. What came\nnext were furious contests between these countries. We might think of this new\nperiod as starting with the Franco-Prussian war of 1870 and as running, with\nincreasing violence, through to the summer of 1945 and the end of World War Two.\nIn this era, Europe’s statesmen struggled from one tragically collapsed balance to\nanother.

The freeze would not be open-\nended, but last for 10 months, as a way of boosting the effort to restart\nnegotiations. It would apply to new construction, not work already underway. And\nit would exclude the post-1967 neighborhoods inside the expanded city limits of\nJerusalem. Like his other moves, it was also dismissed as insignificant by the\nPalestinians. Though there was a formal restarting of the talks, they went almost\nnowhere during the period of the freeze, which Bibi cited as a reason for not\nextending it further. From then on, the negotiations produced even less. I didn’t\nbuy the narrative that this was entirely Bibi’s fault. Abu Mazen remained\nsteadfastly, deliberately passive. Obviously not inclined to take the risk of further\nwidening his rift with Hamas in Gaza, he was content to echo the Obama\nadministration’s argument that nothing could happen until there was a settlement\nfreeze. Once the freeze was announced, he went through the motions, avoiding all\nthe difficult issues, in the expectation Washington would ensure the freeze was\nrenewed. President Obama’s initial Mideast moves had made it much easier for\nAbu Mazen to avoid any serious engagement. In contrast to past presidents, Obama\nhad placed almost all of the onus for progress on Israel. But the end result also\nsuited Bibi. Though I never entirely gave up hope of persuading him it was in\nIsrael’s interest to seek a resolution of our conflict with the Palestinians, it became\nmore evident as the months went on that his aim was simply to keep things ticking\nover, and avoid any major new crisis.\n\nHe appointed an old personal friend — a corporate lawyer named Yitzhak\nMolcho — as our negotiator. I finally realized how pointless the exercise was when,\nduring a visit to the United States, I found myself in New York at the same time as\nMolcho. We met at the Israeli consulate. We spoke in detail about the state of the\nnegotiations. With Molcho still in the room, I phoned Bibi in Jerusalem on the\nsecure phone line. I said I’d just been updated on the talks, and it seemed clear\nthere were a number of suggestions Israel could make, with no domestic political\nrisk but with every prospect of improving the atmosphere and accelerating\nprogress. “Yitzhak is one of Israel’s top lawyers,” I said. “He’s struck dozens of\ndeals in his life. But he strikes a deal when that’s what his client wants. You are the\nclient. If you tell him: bring me back the best deal you can — not a peace treaty, just\na deal on a specific issue — he’ Il do it. But if his brief is simply to negotiate, he can\ngo on negotiating forever. And it’s pretty clear me that’s his brief.” Bibi insisted I\nwas wrong. He said that what I saw as time-wasting was simple prudence, to make\nsure the negotiations bore fruit.

My\nmaternal alarm bells went off straight away and I already knew my\nanswer. No way I could I do that to any poor baby, God only knew what\nthese monsters had in store for me let alone a baby, but it was an instant\nreaction that saved me. “I don’t know guy’s, | mean I’m really young\nand never really even thought about having kids yet. Wow, I just don’t\nknow.” I slicked my hand through my hair nervously and took in a silent\nbreath. [ had to go beyond what I was truly feeling and give them the\nfeeling that I’d never let them down. Putting an eager smile on my face\nand sucking up my gut’s intuition I told them “You know what, let me get\nmy certificates in massage and have some time to prepare for this and get\nhealthy then next year we’ll all think about having a baby together.” It\nwas crazy to even hear me say out loud but from the expressions on their\nfaces I had fulfilled their wishes.\n\nMuch reason to celebrate that night they were both in a cheery mood\naround the dinner table. Except for me who had taken double the dosage\nof Xanax to even cope with the high amounts of anxiety I had been\nsuffering from since we got back from the dock. I wasn’t sipping the\nchampagne that night, I was gulping it and when their moods tumed from\ncheery to raunchy later that evening it wasn’t hard for me to comply.\nFrom the full effects of the state I was in I would’ve agreed to just about\nanything, allowing them to treat themselves to ravishing the tender parts\nof my body.\n\nOver the next few weeks everything went on as it normally would, and\nnot another mention of their proposal. My birthday was only a week away\nand I was turning nineteen that year. All ] wanted was to get my\ncertificates before I got any older and get trapped into this life for good.\nWhen my big day rolled around I was in New York with Jeffrey and\nGhislane. Sitting on my bed listening to MTV’s channel blare in the\nbackground of my room I was painting my toenails when I was suddenly\nbuzzed on the intercom. It was Jeffrey calling himself to ask me to meet\nhim in his office in ten minutes. Perfect timing to let my nails dry I\nthought to myself. Already contemplating his desire to come downstairs I\nknew it had something to do with my birthday present but I was more\nexpecting the usual shopping money or piece of jewelry, definitely not\nwhat he had in store for me.\n\nI knocked on the slightly ajar door to Jeffrey’s office and heard him\nbeckon me inside. “Hello, what cha up too?” I asked in a cutesy tone of\nvoice. Walking over to his desk he looked up at me taking his reading\n\n115\n\n©] Copyright Protected Material\nCONFIDENTIAL GIUFFRE004248\n\nglasses off while granting me a big smile. “Come over here and sit down\nwith me” as he ushered me to come sit on his lap. Pulling me onto him he\nhad a funny look on his face, like he had something really big to tell me\nand was letting the anticipation build in the thickness of the silence.\n“What???” I laughed at the way he was looking at me now. “First of\nall.:. Happy birthday today.” Was only the beginning of his\nannouncement and he proceeded to tell me “I know how much you have\nwanted this for so long and you are more than deserving of it. You are\ngoing away to Thailand to learn authentic Thai Massage and within eight\nweeks you'll receive a certificate for being a qualified Thai Massage\nTherapist.” Astonished at his attempts to see me get what 1 wanted, not\nexactly the type of massage I was interested in but it was a start and a\nfirst certificate for me to acquire. My eyes lit up and I threw my arms\naround his neck, planting a big kiss on his lips, which I rarely ever did.\n“Wow, I don’t know what to say, this is beyond my wildest\ndreams...thank you so much!” I did well to let him know I appreciated\nhis grandeur offer. He went on to give me the details of where I’d be\nstaying, the school’s schedules, and how much he loved Thai massage,\napparently it was the next big thing to hit the shores of America. He had\nplanned out an entire itinerary for me. I was to depart at the end of\nAugust and he had already enrolled me in a class at “ITM Massage\nSchool”. I would only have a few days to settle in before I would be\nattending classes five days a week over eight hours a day. He even had an\nassignment for me to do while I was over there. | was to meet up with a\ngirl who was also being put up at the “Princess Hotel” where | was\nstaying. She had an Asian sounding name so I just assumed she was a\nlocal girl hoping for an opportunity of a lifetime, if she only knew what\nshe would be getting herself into. If 1 decided that she met Jeffrey’s\nparticular quota of approval then she would be sent over to the U.S to\nmeet with him or one of his esteemed colleagues. Besides the guilt of\nhaving to decide a stranger’s uncertain fate, everything else sounded\nmore than wonderful. Eight weeks gone from Jeffrey sounded like a\nlifetime away and I couldn’t be more excited at this chance. It was the\nopportunity of my lifetime and I wasn’t going to waste a second of it.\nGhislane came in a few minutes later and the look on her face told me\nshe already knew. I got up from Jeffrey’s lap and gave her a big hug and\ntold her, “This is so nice of you guys, Thank you so much!” She didn’t\nshare my enthusiasm of excitement. In a dull tone she responded, “I\ndidn’t have a thing to do with it, it was all Jeffrey’s idea but good-luck\nanyways.” She gave me her best impression of being human for a brief\nsecond and hugged me back. It was just her way and I had come to accept\nit. Depending on the level of slander her insults provoked was just her\nway of telling you she cares without really ever showing it.

I was\nespecially surprised given that your letter arrived on only the second day back to work after the\nThanksgiving Holiday, and yet your demands regarding timing suggest that I have been sitting on\nmy hands for days.\n\nYou should know that the first time I learned about Judge Davis’s selection of Podhurst\nand Josephsberg, and indeed the first time I ever heard their names, was in our meeting with you\non Wednesday of last week. Nevertheless, I have now been able to confer with my client, and we\nhave determined that the selection of Podhurst and Josephsberg are acceptable to us, reserving, of\ncourse, our previously stated objections to the manner in which you have interpreted the section\n2255 portions of the Agreement.\n\nWe do, however, strongly and emphatically object to your sending a letter to the alleged\nvictims. Without a fair opportunity to review and the ability to make objections to this letter, it is\ncompletely unacceptable that you would send it without our consideration. Additionally, given\nthat the US Attorney’s office has made clear it cannot vouch for the claims of the victims, it\nwould be incendiary and inappropriate for your Office to send such a letter. Indeed, because it is\na certainty that any such letter would immediately be leaked to the press, your actions will only\nhave the effect of injuring Mr. Epstein and promoting spurious civil litigation directed at him.\nWe believe it is entirely unprecedented, and in any event, inappropriate for the Government to be\nthe instigator of such lawsuits.\n\nFinally, we disagree with your view that you are required to notify the alleged victims\npursuant to the Justice for All Act of 2004. First, 18 USC section 2255, the relevant statute\nunder the Non-Prosecution Agreement for the settlement of civil remedies, does not have any\nconnection to the Justice for All Act. Section 2255 was enacted as part of a different statute.\nSecond, the Justice for All Act refers to restitution, and section 2255 is not a restitution statute.\nIt is a civil remedy. As you know, we had offered to provide a restitution fund for the alleged .\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_012676\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

You would not be \nable to do a competing book or documentary before then. This is not to say that they shouldn't be pursued. In \na sense, better that they know what Patterson's position is and, a year from now say, be able to counter it. I \nhave some thoughts on book and doc to share at your convenience. \nThat being said, you do need an immediate counter narrative to the book. I believe Trump offers an ideal \nopportunity. It's a chance to make the story about something other than you, while, at the same time, letting \nyou frame your own story. Also, becoming an anti-Trump voice gives you a certain political cover which you \ndecidedly don't have now. Still, this necessary involves you going public. And so the most basic decision is \nabout your willingness to do that. My view is that in a couple of weeks you could master message and \ntechnical proficiency. I know a bunch of people who could be very helpful here. This would involve something \nalong the lines of you writing an op-ed, doing a high profile television interview (Charlie Rose, I'd say), and \nperhaps some social media efforts. \nSpeaking of which, again, I think a strategic plan, involving your public identity, philanthropic activities and \ninterests, and the development of media allies, ought finally to be put in place. A big, comprehensive, \nexpensive effort. \nThe alternative is to continue to keep head down and hope Patterson book is just more he-said she-said and \nConnolly getting lost in the reeds (which, as an inveterate conspiracist, he always does). My worry is that \nPatterson can be counted on to produce a bestseller, and while he isn't regarded as a serious writer, he'll \nsurely be unloading a lot of tabloid copy. Because this will be tied to the election, the Trump-Clinton angle will \namp up the attention 10-fold, in fact, possibly, a hundred fold. Possibly more than anything you've \nencountered before. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 033589 \nMeanwhile--\nIn a lawyer's letter, I'd suggest including the following points--not necessarily legal, but a warning about how a \npress campaign might unfold (publishers are more worried about being caught in negative media controversy \nthan they are of legal threats): \n1) Little, Brown has made on the record representations to at least one well-known journalist that it was not \npublishing a book by James Patterson about Jeffrey Epstein--possibly an effort to avoid inquiries about the \nquestionable nature of the book; \n2) The actual author of the book, John Connolly, is someone other than the stated author, James Patterson. \nConnolly is known to have developed an obsession with Epstein, such that, his longtime employer, Vanity Fair, \nhas refused to allow him to write about Epstein for the magazine; \n3) Sources have confirmed for us that Patterson has had little more than a minimal consulting role in the book, \nand that Connolly has functioned in every material way as the book's researcher and writer. We believe \nPatterson's \"authorship\" of the book will not stand up to scrutiny. And, indeed, that the entire notion of an \nextension of the Patterson franchise into nonfiction, as it has been used in fiction and children's book--\neffectively other authors writing under the Patterson name—presents a host of journalism ethical issues. \nplease note \nThe information contained in this communication is \nconfidential, may be attorney-client privileged, may \nconstitute inside information, and is intended only for \nthe use of the addressee.

The researchers at-\ntempted to assess the combined impact\nof many different kinds of trials using\nmeta-analysis, a statistical technique for\nextracting information from studies that\nare not statistically significant by them-\nselves. Their article, “Is the Placebo Pow-\nerless? An Analysis of Clinical Trials\nComparing Placebo with No Treat-\nment,” published in The New England\nJournal of Medicine, was a long-overdue\nresponse to Beecher’s 1955 paper.\n\nIn almost every case, the researchers re-\nported, there was essentially no difference\nbetween the placebo group and the openly\nuntreated group. There were particular ex-\nceptions in studies of pain, where there\nwas a slight but measurable placebo effect.\nSince we are physiologically capable of\nmanufacturing our own painkillers—en-\ndorphins—the result may not have been\nsurprising. Expectations and suggestion\nclearly influence behavior, and when we\nexpect to receive medicine our bodies\noften begin to prepare for it. (As the evo-\nlutionary biologist Robert Trivers recently\npointed out, in “The Folly of Fools,” his\nbook about the historical necessity of de-\nceit, what the brain expects to happen in\nthe near future affects its physiological\nstate. Trivers’s theory would explain a fact\nthat has often baffled scientists: the pla-\ncebo effect doesn’t appear to work with\nAlzheimer’s patients. Trivers suggests that\nthis is because most people who have Al-\nzheimer’s disease are unable to anticipate\nthe future and are therefore unable to pre-\npare for it.)\n\nThe Danish researchers repeated the\nstudy in 2004, and again last year, incor-\nporating new data each time. The re-\nsults and their conclusions remained\nthe same. “We found little evidence in\ngeneral that placebos had powerful clin-\nical effects,” Hrdbjartsson wrote. “Out-\nside the setting of clinical trials, there is\nno justification for the use of placebos.”\n\nKaptchuk has great respect for Hré-\nbjartsson, yet he is wary of relying on\nmeta-analyses, and he believes that an\nhonest interaction between a doctor and\na patient can significantly alter the out-\ncome of treatment. That was the point of\nhis study of irritable-bowel syndrome, in\nwhich some subjects were told that they\nwould not be treated. I.B.S., a chronic\ngastrointestinal disorder, is one of the\nmost common reasons that people seek\n\nmedical care. Effective long-term thera-\npies have proved elusive. In Kaptchuk’s\nstudy, eighty patients were randomly di-\nvided into two groups. Patients in the first\ngroup received a placebo pill twice a day;\nthose in the second received nothing. Be-\nfore the study began, both groups were\ntold that placebos were “inert or inactive\npills, like sugar pills, without any medica-\ntion in them.” They were also informed\nthat placebos have been shown in “rigor-\nous clinical testing to produce significant\nmind-body self-healing processes.” Pa-\ntients who received the openly distributed\nplacebo scored far better on standard as-\nsessments of their condition than those\nwho received nothing. There were also\nstatistically significant differences in the\nseverity of symptoms.\n\nAlthough a group of eighty patients is\ntoo small to draw definitive conclusions,\nhonesty seemed to work. “Asbjorn’s stuff\nis a constant intellectual challenge,” Kapt-\nchuk wrote in an e-mail. “His meta-anal-\nyses are tops. Great methods, very careful.\nClear.” Yet Kaptchuk also pointed out\nthat placebos are not the only interven-\ntions that can cause complicated reac-\ntions. Drugs do, too. Opiods, for exam-\nple, increase pain in about ten per cent of\nthose who take them. Antibiotics don’t al-\nways work, and neither does cortisone, a\npowerful steroid used each year by mil-\nlions of people. Meta-analyses are useful\nto help understand large amounts of data\nfrom different trials. But statistical results\nthat combine information from a\nvariety of medical centers, with\ndifferent kinds of patients, often\nin different countries, adminis-\ntered under different conditions,\ncannot be uniform and therefore\ncannot be conclusive.\n\nHrébjartsson and Kaptchuk\nare united on at least one front.\nLike Wayne Jonas, they agree\nthat the medical system needs to\nchange. “You have to put this into\nthe context of the society in which\nyou live,” Hrébjartsson told me. “Because\nI think this may be as much a matter of\nphilosophy as of science. There is an anti-\ntechnological, anti-science feeling in the\nWest. We constantly see frustration with\nthe limits of medicine. The placebo can be\nseen in some sense as a logical avenue for\nthose frustrations. Everyone wants a sim-\nple, pain-free solution. But I wonder if that\napproach isn’t just the mirror image of the\n\npharmacological way of handling illness—\nthat there is a pill for every disease.\n\n“The entire idea of a placebo is very\n‘soapy, ” Hrébjartsson continued. “It slips\naway whenever you try to find a border.”\n\nThat has always been true. After all, for\nmany people a placebo is just a sugar pill.\nFor others, the definition includes the en-\ntire ritual of treatment, the complete inter-\naction between doctor and patient. In-\ncreased attention has mostly raised new\nquestions: What are the physical and psy-\nchological mechanisms that produce pla-\ncebo effects? What are the conditions they\nmost easily affect? And can we actually\nidentify people who respond to placebos?\nScientists now have bits of answers to some\nof those questions, but to reach their goal,\nand introduce placebos into clinical prac-\ntice, they will need to answer all of them.\n\nT Kaptchuk gets a great deal of\npleasure from focussing on what\nother people reject. Indifference seems to\nmotivate him. “I was raised in a crazy\nhome, and it prepared me to accept any\nproposition,” he said. That, he once told\nme, is why he was so active in the sixties:\n“Tt was a time when the underpinnings of\nthe universe were questioned.” Both of\nKaptchuk’s parents, who were Poles, sur-\nvived the Holocaust. “That really defines\na lot of what I do. My father was a Red,\nso I have a tendency to get pleasure from\nsubversiveness.”\n\nA particularly radical son of the six-\nties, Kaptchuk was one of the\nfounders of the Columbia Uni-\nversity chapter of Students for\na Democratic Society, in 1965,\nbut the organization was soon\ndominated by a faction that be-\ncame the Weather Under-\nground. That was too radical\neven for Kaptchuk. He fled to\nthe West Coast. “I was hanging\nout with the San Francisco Red\nGuards and reading Mao, trying\nto get away from U.S. imperial-\nism,” he said. “I was militant and crazy.\nBut at some point I said, Ted, this is not\nbeing human.”\n\nKaptchuk decided to pursue studies in\nChinese philosophy and medicine at the\nsource. Beijing had yet to open its bor-\nders to Americans, but Kaptchuk hoped\nthat his revolutionary bona fides would\nprompt the leadership to make an excep-\ntion. “My request to study there was de-\n\nTHE NEW YORKER, DECEMBER 12, 201 35\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_029930\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

But the internet in particular\nwas seen as an irresistible force that could render\ncensorship of any kind impossible. In 2000, President\nBill Clinton compared China's efforts to control inter-\nnet content to “trying to nail Jell-O to the wall.””\n\nThird, a growing number of experts began to identify\nanew instigator of democratic change in global civil\nsociety. Unlike the “peoples movements’ of earlier\ndecades, in which well-known leaders mobilized mass\ndemonstrations and often insurrectionary violence\nwith the goal of overthrowing despotic regimes, the\nphenomenon that was labeled civil society consisted\nof organizations that were often committed to a single\ncause or a few causes united by a particular theme.\nMost activists were young, with little prior involvement\nin politics, and many regarded themselves as part of\n\na global effort to advance goals like reducing carbon\nemissions, empowering women, or fighting corruption.\n\nIn a prescient 1997 article, Jessica T. Mathews predict-\ned that in the future global civil society would be the\ntriggering force behind liberal change.* She suggested\nthat in many cases civil society organizations would\nplay amore important role than governments. Her\nwords seemed prescient in light of later events in\nSerbia, where student activists organized a campaign\nthat eventually brought about the downfall of President\nSlobodan MiloSevicé in 2000, and in Ukraine, where\nyoung reformers played a pivotal role in ensuring that\nthe 2004 elections were not stolen through fraud.\n\nIn declaring that dictatorships or even authoritarian\nmethods were destined to succumb to this triad of\n\nnew social forces, commentators were also express-\ning optimism about the universal appeal of liberal\nvalues. The decade after the end of the Cold War\nwas a heyday for democratic ideas and norms. It was\nincreasingly expected that countries would not only\nhold elections, but that their elections would meet\ninternational standards and be judged “free and fair.”\nThere was also an expectation that political parties\nwould be able to compete on a reasonably level\nplaying field, that opposition leaders would not be\nharassed or arrested, and that minorities would be\nable to pursue their agendas through normal political\nchannels and not find it necessary to wage perpetual\nprotest campaigns.\n\nHowever, there were nagging questions. It remained\nunclear whether most societies would have access to\nmultiple sources of political ideas, multiple interpreta-\ntions of the news, and open scholarly inquiries about\nthe past. Would there be honest judicial proceedings,\nespecially in cases with political implications? Would\nproperty rights be secure?\n\nBeyond these primarily domestic issues, there was\nanother series of questions related to individual\ngovernments’ relations with their neighbors and the\nrest of the world. The end of the Cold War had brought\na peace dividend, both financial and psychological,\n\nfor all sides. At the time, most assumed that peace\nwould prove durable. But would the general decline\n\nin military budgets hold? Would the new national\nboundaries that divided the former Soviet Union and\nthe former Yugoslavia be sustainable?\n\nAs modern authoritarianism has taken root and ex-\npanded its influence, the answers to these questions\nare increasingly negative.\n\n1.

She certainly won mine. But I was not alone in wondering whether it\nwas worth the price that she, Kadima, and the country would pay as a result: Bibi’s\nreturn as Prime Minister in a Likud-led coalition.\n\nThough I was not surprised when he asked me to remain as Defense Minister,\nand to keep Labor inside the coalition, that was not an easy argument to make to\nmy reduced Knesset contingent. They saw joining Bibi, especially in a government\nwith the right-wing Lieberman as Foreign Minister, as a betrayal of all the efforts\nthat they and I had made to achieve peace with the Palestinians. Still, the decision\non whether to join the coalition ultimately rested with the party central committee,\nalmost every one of whose members was on a local government council. For them,\nthe choice was between a share of power, however limited, and the wilderness of\nopposition. So we joined Bibi’s government.\n\nI was personally in favor of our doing so, but for more complicated reasons. I\nknew that Bibi’s background, his instincts and his undeniably powerful political\nrhetoric were all firmly rooted on the political right. I recognized that he was often\nmore interested in politics than policy, and perhaps above both of those, in the\ntactical maneuvering required to consolidate his political position. But I had known\nhim long enough to dismiss the suggestions of many of my colleagues that he was\nintellectually shallow. I felt he was capable of doing what was best for Israel, and\nthat he had a basic pragmatism that would guide how he got there. All that,\nhowever, was just a reason for not saying “no” when he asked me and Labor to\nstay on. The reason I felt it was right to say yes had to two with specific policy\nchallenges. The first was to ensure there at least some peace process with the\nPalestinians. But that, in turn, was in large part because I believed it would win us\nthe diplomatic support, especially from the Americans, needed to tackle a more\nurgent threat. It again involved an enemy state trying to get nuclear weapons. But\nnot Syria. The Islamic theocracy of Iran.\n\nWe’d been aware for a number of years about Iranian efforts to go nuclear. The\nMossad had notched up a series of successes in delaying the Iranians from getting\nthere. But they were getting inexorably closer. In fact, when I’d taken over as\nDefense Minister under Olmert, I formally directed the new chief-of-staff, Gaby\nAshknazi, to get to work on a plan to attack the most important facilities in the\nIranians’ nuclear network, with the aim of pushing back the point at which they\nmight develop a bomb by five to six years.

L. Rev. 844, *902\n\nResponses to unjustified police violence reveal a third outcome for enforcement redundancy confined to the federalism model.\nFederal enforcement authority extends to cases of police violence to a much greater degree than for sexual assaults. That\nauthority extends as well to other kinds of bias-motivated wrongdoing by both private actors and government officials, which\nlocal police and prosecutors have at times ignored or devalued, and for which state-level enforcement commitment continues to\nbe uneven. !” Federal jurisdiction is coextensive with state jurisdiction regarding police wrongdoing, and the Justice\nDepartment's institutional capacity for enforcement probably exceeds that of its state counterparts, but in one respect the\noverlap is not complete. The key substantive criminal offenses available to prosecutors in the federal code are somewhat more\nrestrictive. The primary federal statute used to charge cases of [*903] police excessive use of force requires proof of willful\n\ndeprivation of rights, °°\n\na strict mens rea standard that makes it harder for federal prosecutors to prove liability than it would\nbe for state prosecutors relying on typical assault or homicide offense definitions. 7°! The fact that Congress has for decades\nlet stand this mens rea hurdle to excessive-force prosecutions suggests that federal legislators, if not Justice Department\nofficials, are less committed to a full federal-state enforcement redundancy - or \"to altering the federal-state balance in order to\nreinforce state law enforcement\" - than they are for public corruption offenses. 7°\n\nThat limit notwithstanding, federal prosecutions in this area have a track record of succeeding where state prosecutions failed\nor were never attempted, and in that way providing at least a partial remedy for underenforcement by state criminal justice\nofficials. Much of the federal advantage comes from the fact that federal prosecutors are, in general, better situated to\nobjectively investigate, assess, and prosecute wrongdoing by police officers than are local prosecutors who ordinarily interact\nwith and depend upon those officers (or at least their agencies). This is not a particular criticism of local prosecutors’ offices; it\nis one instance of the basic problem that officials (and people generally) are untrustworthy judges of the conduct of others with\nwhom they have affiliations, allegiances, or ongoing relationships. For that reason a few states assign such cases to state-level,\nrather than local, officials. 7° And the U.S. Justice Department attempts to collect data on deaths in jails, prison, or during\n[#904] attempted arrests, to facilitate Justice Department oversight. ?°4 The same concerns motivate English laws applying\nspecial judicial scrutiny (when triggered by requests from victims' families) to prosecutor's decisions not to charge in the case\n\nof death caused by law enforcement officials or occurring in official custody. 7°\n\n131 Some federal states such as Germany and Canada lack enforcement redundancy because they use a single, nationwide, criminal code,\nwhich is enforced for prosecution agencies and courts organized at the state or provincial level. See generally Eric P. Polten & Eric Glezl,\nFederalism in Canada and Germany: Overview and Comparison (2014) (describing similarities in German and Canadian federalism,\nincluding allocating authority over substantive criminal law to the federal government but criminal justice administration to state or\nprovincial prosecutors and courts). In Australia, like in the United States, states and the federal government each have their own criminal\ncodes. But Australian federal criminal authority is confined much more narrowly than in the United States to conduct that implicates a\ndistinct federal interest. See generally Arther B. Gunlicks, The Lander and German Federalism 59, 72, 129 (2003) (describing German\ncriminal affairs and jurisdictions as compared to the United States); Polten & Glezl, supra, at 5-6, 10, 13-14; Brian Galligan, Comparative\nFederalism, in The Oxford Handbook of Political Institutions 261, 266-75 (Sarah A. Binder et al. eds., 2008) (discussing federalism and\njudicial review and regulations); Kathleen Daly & Rick Sarre, Criminal Justice System: Aims and Processes, in Crime and Justice: A Guide\nto Criminology 357 (Darren Palmer et al. eds., 5th ed. 2017) (examining the processes and purposes of the criminal justice system); Vicki\nWaye & Paul Marcus, Australia and the United States: Two Common Criminal Justice Systems Uncommonly at Odds, Part 2, 78 Tul. J. Int'l\n& Comp. L. 335 (2010) (highlighting similarities and differences between the two countries in relation to criminal laws and policies).\n\n32 Since 2011, Switzerland also now has unified national criminal law and procedure codes administered in all cantons. See Anna Petrig,\nThe Expansion of Swiss Criminal Jurisdiction in Light of International Law, 9 Utrecht L. Rev. 34, 36 (2013).\n\n33 See Director of Public Prosecutions Act 1983 s 10(2); Annual Report 2014-15, supra note 71.\n\n34 Tn unusual circumstances, two states may also have concurrent jurisdiction over the same crime, enabling one to assess the adequacy of\nthe other's enforcement effort. For a rare example, see Heath v. Alabama, 474 U.S. 82, 91-93 (1985).\n\n35. See U.S. Const. amend. V (Double Jeopardy Clause); Bartkus v. Illinois, 359 U.S. 121, 136-39 (1959) (affirming power of state to\nprosecute defendant after a federal prosecution for the same bank robbery); United States v. Lanza, 260 U.S. 377, 384-85 (1922) (approving\nfederal prosecution after state prosecution based on same conduct).\n\nDAVID SCHOEN\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_016539\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

Crim. L. & Criminology 59, *93\n\nIn 2006, Epstein's acts of abuse came to the attention of the Palm Beach Police Department, which began investigating the case.\n195 At this point, once again, the victims would not have had rights under the proposed CVRA test. The CVRA extends rights in\nthe federal criminal justice process. A state investigation does not trigger the CVRA (although it may trigger certain state law\nprotections, as discussed below). !%°\n\nAt some point in 2006, the Palm Beach Police Department asked the FBI to investigate Epstein on federal sex offenses, such as\nusing a means of [*94] interstate communication in connection with sex offenses and traveling in interstate commerce for the\npurpose of engaging in illicit sexual conduct with minors. !97 The local police provided the FBI with information, which the\nFBI then investigated. Following an investigation, the FBI determined that the allegations of abuse against Epstein were\ncredible, and it presented the case to the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of Florida. In 2007, the Office\ncontacted counsel for Jeffrey Epstein and began negotiating a resolution of the case against him. 78\n\nUnder our proposed test, the victims would not have had CVRA rights the first moment that the FBI became aware of Epstein’s\npossible commission of sex offenses. But after the FBI developed substantial evidence of those sex offenses, identified victims\nof those offenses, and presented the case to the appropriate U.S. Attorney's Office for prosecution, CVRA rights would have\nattached. Accordingly, the FBI would have been required to notify the identified victims of their rights under the CVRA (as\nwell as under the VRRA). From that point forward in the case, the victims would have had CVRA rights, such as the right to\nfair treatment and the right to confer with prosecutors. In this case, the victims would have had the right to confer with\n\nprosecutors about the nonprosecution agreement that they ultimately reached with Epstein. 1°?\n\nC. CURRENT DEPARTMENT POLICY ON PRE-CHARGING RIGHTS\n\nOne objection that might be made to the formulation offered above is that it might unduly burden federal law enforcement\nofficers and prosecutors, who would need to make judgment calls about when an investigation has coalesced to the point where\n\"victims\" are in existence, \"substantial evidence\" has been collected, and notice of rights has to be provided. Any such\nobjection would be ill-founded, though, as it does not appear that implementing such an approach would be difficult. 7°\nPresumably the Justice Department has already been providing such rights in at least Texas, Louisiana, and Mississippi to\ncomply with the Fifth [*95] Circuit's 2008 ruling in In Re Dean, which held that the CVRA extends rights to victims before\n\ndefendants are charged. 7°! We have not seen any reports that providing the rights has been difficult.\n\nPerhaps the reason for the lack of any reported difficulty is that the Department's current policy on crime victims' rights already\nrequires notices to victims during investigations. The Justice Department has promulgated the Attorney General Guidelines for\nVictim and Witness Assistance, the latest edition of which is from May 2012. The Guidelines discuss crime victims’ rights\nunder both the CVRA and the earlier VRRA.

It concerns the experienced direction of time: Why is the past so different from the present and \nthe future? This difference is encapsulated in the expression the arrow of time. It is problematic because all the \nknown laws of nature have exactly the same form, whatever direction, in which time is supposed to flow. The \nBrockman, Inc. Frankfurt 2016 Hotlist \n-1-\nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 025147 \ntechnical expression for this is time-reversal symmetry. This basic property seems to be entirely at odds with the \npronounced unidirectionality of experienced time. In fact, there are several arrows. \n\"Until recent work by myself and my collaborators Tim Koslowski and Flavio Mercati, essentially only one \nproposal had been made—in well over a century—to explain why, despite the time-reversal symmetry of all the \nlaws of nature, these pronounced arrows of time exist, and always have existed, throughout the observable \nuniverse. As I explain in The Janus Point, this sole explanation is a manifest stop gap and satisfies no serious \nscientist. \n\"This has been dubbed the past hypothesis. However, it is not in any sense an explanation that follows from the \nstructure of the law and does not lead to any new prediction. It is an admission of defeat: Modern science fails to \nexplain the most profound aspects of our existence. \n\"The Janus Point is clearly timely because it is about a set of very simple ideas and insights that have the \npotential to solve one of the deepest and longest-standing problems in physics. Everyone is interested in time \nand its numerous puzzling aspects. Proof of that is the success of my earlier book The End of Time, which is still \nselling more than sixteen years after its publication. Some of the ideas conjectured in that book are, in fact, \nrealized in the model now proposed. \n\"For readers, The Janus Point tells the fascinating story of one of the greatest mysteries in science and what \nlooks to be its unexpected and, in principle, remarkably simple solution. More than most books in popular \nscience, its subject resonates profoundly with the reader. Nothing touches us more intimately than the drama of \nbirth, life and death.\" \nJULIAN BARBOUR, an independent researcher, is currently visiting professor at the University of Oxford. He \nhas devoted significant time and effort to issues that lie at the foundations of science, above all the nature of \ntime and motion. His first paper was published in Nature and attracted favorable editorial comment and most \nimportantly led to six years of very valuable collaboration with the well-known Italian theorist Bruno Bertotti. It \nculminated in 1982 with a joint paper in the Proceedings of the Royal Society of London, which is now regarded \nas a seminal paper on the interconnection of local dynamics with the universe at large. Barbour made a big \nimpact in the physics community with the publication of his book, The End of Time, in which, according to \nphysicist Lee Smolin, he presented \"a new theory of time that is the most interesting and provocative new idea \nabout time to be proposed in many years.\" \nAMERICAN KINGPIN \nThe Epic Hunt for the Criminal Mastermind Behind the Silk Road \nBy Nick Bilton \n[US — Portfolio, UK — Virgin Books, Audio — Penguin RH; Manuscript; 304 pages; Publication: May 2017] \nFrom New York Times-bestselling author Nick Bilton comes a true-life thriller about the rise and fall of Ross \nUlbricht, aka the Dread Pirate Roberts, the founder of the online black market Silk Road. \nIn American Kingpin Bilton turns his investigative journalism to the story of Ross Ulbricht, the notorious and \nenigmatic founder of a drug empire called Silk Road. This is a true-life thriller about ambition gone awry, \nspurred on by the defining clash of our time: the new world of libertarian-leaning, anonymous, decentralized \nweb advocates and the old world of government control, order, and the rule of law. Bilton's dazzling rendering \nand gift for narrative make for an endlessly fascinating drama. \nIn 2011, Ulbricht, a twenty-six-year-old libertarian idealist and former Boy Scout, launched \"a website where \npeople could buy anything anonymously, with no trail whatsoever that could lead back to them.\" He called it \nSilk Road, opened for business on the Dark Web, and christened himself the Dread Pirate Roberts (after the \nBrockman, Inc. Frankfurt 2016 Hotlist \n-2-\nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 025148 \nPrincess Bride character). The site grew at a tremendous pace, quickly becoming a $1.2 billion enterprise where \nyou could buy or sell drugs, hacking software, forged passports, counterfeit cash, guns, grenades, and poisons. \nThe Silk Road soon caught the attention of the Feds, who embarked on an epic two-year manhunt for the site's \nproprietor. Ulbricht, in the meantime, struggled to maintain control of his double life and his marketplace, which \nhe originally started to prove that legalizing drugs could make society safer. He gradually abandoned his \nlibertarian ideals to rule Silk Road with increasingly authoritarian force. At one point, he engaged the services of \nhired hit men to take out employees he felt had wronged him. Soon, some of the Federal agents who were \nsupposed to be hunting for Ulbricht were lured into the dark world and switched sides to join him. \nNICK BELTON is a special correspondent for Vanity Fair, where he writes about technology, business, and \nculture, and a contributor at CNBC.

Norton, China— Huazhang, Audio — Audible; Manuscript; Pub Date: April 2017; \n304 pages] \nPioneering neuroscientist Dean Buonomano examines how the brain tells time, predicts the future, and \nunderstands the past in a book that straddles the fields of physics, psychology and neuroscience. \nFew questions are as perplexing and profound as those that relate to time. Philosophers ponder what time is. \nPhysicists grapple with why time appears to be a one-way street, and debate whether it is a single lonely point or \na full-blown dimension. Neuroscientists and psychologists struggle to understand what it means to \"feel\" the \npassage of time and how the brain tells it. Time is also key to the question of free will: is the future an open \npath, or is it preordained by the past? \nThe brain, argues Buonomano, is at its core a time machine. It is the brain's ability to anticipate the actions of \nprey, predators, and mates, and to predict when events will occur in a dynamically changing world, that \nultimately translate into the evolutionary currency of survival and reproduction. \nThe ability of animals to predict the future culminated with Homo sapiens' capacity to grasp the concept of time. \nOnly then were we able to craft a blade for future use, or plant a seed to quench projected hunger. \nYour Brain is a Time Machine explains that, in the end, our intuitions and theories about time reveal as much \nabout the architecture and limitations of our brains as they do about the true nature of time. \nDEAN BUONOMANO is a professor in the Departments of Neurobiology and Psychology at UCLA, and an \ninvestigator in the Integrative Center for Learning and Memory. He is the author of Brain Bugs: How the Brain's \nFlaws Shape Our Lives, which was a Wall Street Journal bestseller, and his research has been highlighted in \nmany national and international magazines and newspapers, including Discover, Newsweek, Scientific American, \nZeit, Cosmos, Horzu Wissen, and the New Yorker. \nBrockman, Inc.

As much as his full length books such as The Selfish Gene, The Blind Watchmaker, and The God Delusion, \nhave changed our perceptions of both science and the world it opens, his essays and articles are potent, pithy, \nthought provoking and revealing windows into the world as he, himself, perceives it. Science in the Soul is a \ncollection of some of Dawkins' best writing: articles and lectures, reflections and polemics, reviews, forewords, \ntributes or eulogies, both published and unpublished. \nFrom the introduction, by Gillian Somerscales: \"Richard Dawkins has always defied categorization. One \neminent biologist of mathematical bent reviewing The Selfish Gene and The Extended Phenotype was startled to \nfind a scientific work apparently free of logical errors and yet containing not a single line of mathematics; he \ncould come to no other conclusion than that, incomprehensible as it seemed to him, 'Dawkins . . . apparently \nthinks in prose.' \n\"If readers of what follows here come to appreciate not only the writer's clarity of thought and facility of \nexpression, the fearlessness with which he confronts very large elephants in very small rooms, the energy with \nwhich he devotes himself to explication of the complex and the beautiful in science, but also some of the \ngenerosity, kindness and courtesy that have characterized all my dealings with Richard over the years since that \nfirst collaboration, then the present volume will have achieved one of its aims. \n\"It will have achieved another if it embodies a condition felicitously described in one of the essays reproduced \nhere, where 'harmonious parts flourish in the presence of each other, and the illusion of a harmonious whole \nemerges.'

This question fascinates people from poets and painters to \nphysicists, psychologists, and philosophers. From Bacteria to Bach and Back is Daniel C. Dennett's brilliant \nanswer, extending perspectives from his earlier work in surprising directions, exploring the deep interactions of \nevolution, brains, and human culture. \nPart philosophical whodunit, part bold scientific conjecture, this landmark work enlarges themes that have \nsustained Dennett's legendary career at the forefront of philosophical thought. In his inimitable style—laced \nBrockman, Inc. Frankfurt 2016 Hotlist \n-4-\nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 025150 \nwith wit and arresting thought experiments—Dennett shows how culture enables reflection by installing a \nbounty of thinking tools, or memes, in our brains. Language, itself composed of memes, turbocharged this \ninterplay. The result, a mind that can comprehend the questions it poses, emerges from a process of cultural \nevolution. \nAn agenda-setting book for a new generation of philosophers and other researchers, From Bacteria to Bach and \nBack will delight and entertain anyone who hopes to understand human creativity in all its wondrous \napplications. \nDANIEL C.

Doudna and Samuel H. Sternberg \n[US — Houghton Mifflin, UK — Bodley Head, China — Hunan Science, Audio — Audible; Manuscript; Pub \nDate: June 2017; 320 pages] \nIn the tradition of The Double Helix, A Crack in Creation is an insider's account of the biggest scientific \ndiscovery of our era: a cheap, easy way of rewriting genetic code, with nearly limitless promise and peril. \nNot since the atomic bomb has a technology so alarmed its inventors that they warned the world against its use. \nNot, that is, until the spring of 2015, when biologist Jennifer Doudna called for a worldwide moratorium on the \nuse of the new gene-editing tool CRISPR to make heritable changes in human embryos. The cheapest, simplest, \nmost effective way of manipulating DNA ever known, CRISPR may well give us the cure to HIV, genetic \ndiseases, and some cancers, and will help address the world's hunger crisis. Yet even the tiniest changes to DNA \ncould have myriad, unforeseeable consequences—to say nothing of the ethical and societal repercussions of \nintentionally mutating embryos to create \"better\" humans. \nWriting with fellow researcher Samuel Sternberg, Doudna shares the thrilling story of her discovery, and \npassionately argues that enormous responsibility comes with the ability to rewrite the code of life. With \nCRISPR, she shows, we have effectively taken control of evolution. What will we do with this unfathomable \npower? \nJENNIFER A.

Lieberman is well known for \nhis unique and unusually integrative approach to research, which combines paleontology, anatomy, physiology \nand experimental biomechanics. \n\"Endurance,\" Lieberman writes, \"argues that we need to rethink how we think about exercise using the dual \nlenses of anthropology and evolutionary biology. As the modern word 'exercise' itself implies, people today \ngenerally think of physical activity as a pastime or a form of medicine. Most of us spend the majority of the day \nsitting and then we briefly exercise in our spare time, sometimes for fun, but increasingly to ward off ill health. \nYet, until very recently, physical activity was a paradoxically fundamental part of being human: utterly \nnecessary but instinctively avoided. Put simply, we evolved to be reluctant endurance athletes. \n\"This legacy underlies and points to urgently needed solutions for today's exercise dilemma. Everyone knows \nthat exercise is vital for good health, yet the vast majority of Americans and others in the developed world are \nunable to exercise enough. Our species endured because we had no choice but to be athletes, and if we wish our \nhealth to endure as individuals, then we still need to make exercise indispensable today. Rather than thinking of \nexercise as a 'magic pill' for good health, it is the absence of physical activity, primarily endurance exercise, that \naccelerates aging and hastens death. Endurance points to a new way of understanding and solving this global \nproblem. \n\"Endurance is the product of a long journey, part intellectual, part physical. Over the last decade I have \ntraversed the globe to observe, often as a participant, how humans are physically active in different traditional \ncultures from Africa to Greenland to India. Among other experiences, I've run barefoot and carried water on my \nhead in Kenya, tracked muskoxen and kudu with indigenous hunters in Greenland and Tanzania, participated in \nthe ancient Tarahumara ballgame under the stars in Mexico, dug millet fields in Rwanda, played barefoot cricket \nin rural India, and raced on foot against horses in the mountains of Arizona. Back in my lab at Harvard, my \nstudents and I have intensively studied the evolution, biomechanics and physiology of key human physical \nactivities, including how we walk, run, throw, dig, climb and even chew. \n\"Endurance weaves together these experiences, perspectives and insights into the form of a highly personal \nnatural history of first rest, then strength, and finally endurance.\" \nDANIEL LIEBERMAN is a professor and chair of the Department of Human Evolutionary Biology at Harvard. \nA leader in the field of human evolutionary biology, Lieberman's research asks how and why evolution made the \nhuman body the way it is.

As E.O. Wilson writes, Losos is a \"world leader in \nresearch and theory of the overlapping fields of herpetology, biodiversity, and species formation.\" \n\"In the last few years,\" Losos writes, \"evolutionary biologists have come to realize that evolution can occur \nmuch more rapidly than Darwin and a century of subsequent biologists ever expected—fast enough, in fact, to \nobserve as it occurs, even during the span of a single research grant! Now that we know that evolution can \nproceed rapidly, experimental studies in natural systems have begun.\" \nLosos' work on lizards has been at the forefront of the experimental evolution movement. Using small \nBahamian islands as test tubes, he and his team have altered conditions and made predictions about how \npopulations should evolve in response. And the results are resoundingly consistent: evolution is extremely \npredictable. \nImprobable Destinies is not only about what we know about evolution, but how we know what we know.

We could only do a cursory explanation of the new reality on campus and how terms like 'trigger \nwarnings,' microaggressions,' and `disinvitations' suddenly rose from obscurity to become part of higher \neducation's and the nation's vocabulary. A full-length book allows us to cover a host of new hot topics, including \nso-called 'safe spaces' and how a warped idea of safety is used to justify campus censorship, as well as campus \n'bias response teams' (BRTs)—Orwellian programs that police the language students use in their private lives \nBrockman, Inc.

It is worth noting that this past spring a professor was actually investigated \nby one of these BRTs for assigning CAM as class reading! \n\"Second, since the article was published, the situation on campus has only worsened. Within a few months after \nthe article's release, student demands for censorship had broken out across the country. \n\"Third, and possibly most importantly, we want to reactivate and deepen the discussion that we started in CAM \nabout the science of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) as a useful lens for looking at any number of modern \nproblems. CBT is a remarkably simple, successful treatment that helps patients overcome their anxiety and \ndepression by teaching them how to identify and combat 'cognitive distortions,' the wild mental exaggerations \nin which the anxious and depressed overindulge. To our knowledge, CAM was the first and only major article to \npropose that we should not only use CBT to examine our own inner thoughts, but also the world around us. \n\"The issue of free speech on campus is extremely hot, and will continue to be for years to come, but virtually no \none besides us is offering a solution that gets to the heart of the problem and can actually help students rather \nthan simply ridiculing them. \n\"Regarding the market, when CAM came out, it seemed that this was a uniquely American problem. But just in \nthe last year, it has spread throughout the UK, and is beginning to appear in Australia. In fact, there has been \nmajor interest in CAM in the UK and European countries. In Europe, I was recently interviewed by \nSiiddeutsche Zeitung, Germany's biggest daily newspaper, and Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung also ran a major \narticle.

Prum \n[US — Doubleday, Audio — Penguin RH; Manuscript; Pub Date: May 2017; 480 pages] \nA major reimagining of how evolutionary forces work, revealing how mating preferences—what Darwin termed \n\"the taste for the beautiful\" —create the extraordinary range of ornament in the animal world. \nIn the great halls of science, dogma holds that Darwin's theory of natural selection explains every branch on the \ntree of life: which species thrive, which wither away to extinction, and what features each evolves. But can \nadaptation by natural selection really account for everything we see in nature? \nYale University ornithologist Richard Prum —reviving Darwin's own views—thinks not. Deep in tropical \njungles around the world are birds with a dizzying array of appearances and mating displays: Club-winged \nManakins who sing with their wings, Great Argus Pheasants who dazzle prospective mates with a four-foot-\nwide cone of feathers covered in golden 3D spheres, Red-capped Manakins who moonwalk. In thirty years of \nfieldwork, Prum has seen numerous display traits that seem disconnected from, if not outright contrary to, \nselection for individual survival. To explain this, he dusts off Darwin's long-neglected theory of sexual selection \nin which the act of choosing a mate for purely aesthetic reasons—for the mere pleasure of it—is an independent \nengine of evolutionary change. \nMate choice can drive ornamental traits from the constraints of adaptive evolution, allowing them to grow ever \nmore elaborate. It also sets the stakes for sexual conflict, in which the sexual autonomy of the female evolves in \nresponse to male sexual control. Most crucially, this framework provides important insights into the evolution of \nhuman sexuality, particularly the ways in which female preferences have changed male bodies, and even \nmaleness itself, through evolutionary time. \nThe Evolution of Beauty presents a unique scientific vision for how nature's splendor contributes to a more \ncomplete understanding of evolution and of ourselves. \nRICHARD 0. PRUM is the William Robertson Coe Professor of Ornithology at Yale University. A lifelong bird \nfanatic, Prum has published more than 100 scientific articles on diverse topics including the evolution, behavior, \nsong, anatomy, developmental biology, phylogenetics, paleontology, optical physics, and pigmentary chemistry \nof birds. He has made ground-breaking scientific contributions to our understanding the evolutionary origin of \nfeathers, the physics of structural coloration, dinosaur feathers, fossil coloration, and the phylogenetic evolution \nof behavior. Over the past thirty years, Prum has developed a unique scientific perspective on evolution, and he \nhas documented this view with major scientific discoveries. \nBrockman, Inc.

Ramachandran, author most recently of The Tell-Tale Brain. \n\"The Interactive Brain,\" writes Ramachandran, \"is a tour of some of the most cherished yet elusive qualities of \nour minds. The book argues that recent advances in neurosciences have contributed to a revolutionary new \nmodel of the brain, in which brain function is controlled, not by highly specialized, hierarchical modules, mainly \nhard-wired, as once thought, but rather by highly interactive modules that can shift their roles in a matter of days \nor even hours The implications are not merely theoretical but have practical applications in medicine, offering \nsolutions for everyone from stroke patients to those with obsessive compulsive disorder. \n\"There are many neurological syndromes I'll discuss throughout the book. For example, a patient who was \notherwise smart and level-headed but kept insisting that his reflection in the mirror was the 'real David,' and that \nthe David viewing the mirror was a clone. He wiped off a tear from his eye and asked 'Dad, if the real David \nreturns will you disown me?' Even the axiomatic foundation of our selfhood—the notion that I'm a single \nperson in one body—is called into question when we encounter patients like him. \n\"Not only can we change our own brains, but we can change the brains of others because of the implications of \nmirror neurons. The Interactive Brain incorporates case studies, such as David's, and my own research on topics \nranging through Capgras Syndrome, chronic pain, calendar synesthesia, gender incongruity, mirror visual \nfeedback, and obsessive-compulsive disorder, the majority of which I have not considered in detail in my \nprevious books. \n\"I conclude by visiting some of the most prized but elusive aspects of our minds considered unapproachable by \nscience, such as math, music, and metaphor, and suggest that these quintessentially human abilities are best \nelucidated by combining an evolutionary approach with old-fashioned neurology.\" \nV.S.

Frankfurt 2016 Hotlist \n-11-\nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 025157 \n\"us\" or \"they\" and it's a question asked millions of times a day in all the languages of the world in response to \nall manner of human behavior, good and bad. \nWhat brings out the best in us? What brings out the worst? For every complex problem, there's a solution that's \nsimple, appealing, and wrong, H. L. Mencken famously said, and there are certainly many simple and wrong \nanswers to this most important of questions, the question at the root of the way we parent, the way we educate, \nthe way we manage, and the way we punish. The simple yet correct response, of course, is that it's \ncomplicated. The longer answer? For that, the great neuroscientist and primatologist Robert Sapolsky needed \nten years, and this book. \nBehave is an epic achievement. In order to make sense of all the sources that conspire to affect human behavior, \nit begins in the very moment of action, when we commit the decisive deed in question. What is happening in \nour brain and body at the very moment, and in the minutes that preceded it? The book then pulls back to look \nhow the behavior is conditioned by what the body is exposed to in the days, weeks and months leading up to \nthat behavior. It then goes back to childhood and adolescence, at how the bending of the bough effects how the \ntree grows. And so on, from neurobiology, endocrinology and the interaction of our senses with the \nenvironment to a lifetime's most primal shaping influences, and from there back to our genetic makeup and the \nvery sticky wicket of how genes and environment interact (and how they don't). Finally, Sapolsky expands the \nview to take in factors that push us past any single person's inheritance and experience: namely culture, in the \npresent tense and back hundreds, even thousands of years, and then back millions of years, to the first humans \nand the evolution of behavior. \nThe result is surely among the most dazzling tours d 'horizon of the science of human behavior ever attempted, \na majestic synthesis of cutting-edge research, some of it the author's own, across a range of disciplines to \nprovide a subtle and necessary reckoning with the roots of our most troubling and inspiring behaviors, relating \nto racism, tribalism, and xenophobia; tolerance and altruism; hierarchy and competition; morality and free will; \nand war and peace. Wise, learned, funny, and fearless, Behave is a great scientist's towering achievement, a \nbook that takes both the angel and the devil off of our shoulders and into our hands. \nROBERT SAPOLSKY is the John A. and Cynthia Fry Gunn Professor at Stanford University, holding joint \nappointments in several departments, including Biological Sciences, Neurology & Neurological Sciences, and \nNeurosurgery.

Yet this saga is an untold story, as far as today's general audience is \nconcerned. Taming Infinity will tell it for the first time. \nBrockman, Inc. Frankfurt 2016 Hotlist \n-12-\nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 025158 \n\"Calculus is one of the greatest ideas that anyone has ever had and certainly the greatest idea in all of \nmathematics. The scientific and technological importance of calculus is one reason why we require all budding \nscientists and engineers to learn the subject. Taming Infinity is the human side of calculus: the gripping story of \nhow it was discovered, and lost, and then rediscovered a thousand years later, or how it perplexed many of the \ngeniuses who struggled to invent it, and in a few tragic cases, drove them insane. In a very real sense, this \nhumanistic side of calculus is just as fascinating and important as its scientific side as it, too, has changed the \nworld. \n\"Central to the story is the mathematicians' quest to tame infinity, which begins with the philosopher Zeno of \nElea (about 450 BC, before Socrates) who raised paradoxes about infinity, continuity, time, space, and motion \nthat confounded his contemporaries and provoked no less than Aristotle to banish infinity from Greek \nphilosophy and mathematics from then on. Fast-forward more than 2,500 years, and we're still wrestling with \ninfinity and the paradoxes it raises. In between, the inventors of calculus, starting with Archimedes around 250 \nBC and culminating with Newton and Leibniz in the mid-1600s, tried to domesticate infinity to make what we \nnow regard as integral and differential calculus. And to a large extent, they succeeded. The carefully controlled \nuse of infinity is the secret to calculus, the source of its enormous predictive power. \n\"But like Frankenstein's monster or the golem in Jewish folklore, infinity was never quite under control. As in \nany tale of hubris, the monster inevitably turned on its creator. Soon after the work of Newton and Leibniz, \ndisturbing paradoxes emerged in the 1700s and early 1800s. Calculations came out wrong. Calculus seemed \nunreliable. These difficulties provoked another wave of philosophical and logical handwringing, much as Zeno's \nhad two millennia earlier. These conundrums were resolved over the next century by the mathematicians who \ncalled themselves 'analysts.' The name was apt. They put calculus on the couch, and probed it, trying to root out \nevery last trace of pathology. They succeeded for calculus, but not for infinity itself. There the pathology ran \ndeeper. The riddles of infinity are still challenging logicians, mathematicians, and philosophers today.\" \nSTEVEN STROGATZ is the Jacob Gould Schurman Professor of Applied Mathematics at Cornell University. \nHe is the bestselling author of The Joy Of X, The Calculus Of Friendship, and Sync.

Norton; Proposal; 70,000 words; Delivery: February 2018] \nAdam Waytz is a rising star in the Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University, whose research \nuses methods from social psychology and cognitive neuroscience to study how people think about minds. Waytz \nis the first person to receive twice the Theoretical Innovation Prize from the Society for Personality and Social \nPsychology. He is also the winner of the SAGE Young Scholar Award and the International Social Cognition \nNetwork's Early Career Award. \nWaytz writes: \"Everyday life is increasingly human-free. Robotic technology has begun replacing human jobs \nand will replace millions more over the next five years. In domains such as manufacturing and agriculture, \nrobotic employees are already a reality. Tasks like getting directions from another human or consulting with a \nbank teller to deposit money have become obsolete. These advances contribute to well-documented declines in \nsocial interaction. Not only has interaction with human beings diminished, but existing human interaction has \nBrockman, Inc. Frankfurt 2016 Hotlist \n-13-\nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 025159 \ndeclined in quality. People feel less trusting of others than in previous decades, face-to-face communication is \nless frequent, and people's social networks have become more fragmented, producing smaller social clusters \nrather than expansive, civic community groups. Empathy with other humans, considering others' wants, feelings, \nneeds, and motivations (the essence of what makes us human), has diminished considerably. Rises in income \ninequality and political polarization also mean that our diversity of social experiences—encountering people \nunlike 'us' —is diminishing as well, enabling little consideration of humans dissimilar to ourselves. \n\"The Power of Human represents a call to action. This book details the psychological cost of losing our \nhumanity and elucidates scientifically supported strategies to counteract this trend, many of which are already \nunderway. Although scholars have bemoaned declines in social interaction, their concerns often erroneously \ncenter on people's deteriorating social skills, communication abilities, and intelligence (for which evidence is \ndecidedly mixed). Meanwhile, the real costs of this decline on moral behavior, employee productivity, \nmobilizing social movements, and finding meaning in life have gone overlooked. This book elucidates how we \noften overlook how psychologically powerful humans are, and provides strategies to rejuvenate efforts to \nrecognize others' humanity. \n\"The Power of Human is unique in providing solutions to this problem that will help businesses retain customers \nand employees, help charities raise more money, help people experience greater significance from simple \neveryday activities, help technologists design better robots, help reduce conflict between different political and \nreligious sects, and increase happiness in relationships with friends and spouses.\" \nADAM WAYTZ is an associate professor of management and organizations in the Kellogg School of \nManagement at Northwestern University. His research has been published in leading journals such as \nProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, and \nPsychological Review. Waytz received the 2008 and 2013 Theoretical Innovation Award from the Society for \nPersonality and Social Psychology, the SAGE Foundation Young Scholar Award, and the International Social \nCognition Network's Early Career Award. In 2015, Poets and Quants named him one of the \"Best 40 Business \nSchool Professors Under the Age of 40.\" He has written articles for the New York Times, the Boston Globe, Wall \nStreet Journal, Harvard Business Review, Scientific American, and Slate. \nSCALE \nThe Search for Simplicity and Unity in the Complexity of Life, from Cells to Cities, Companies to \nEcosystems, Milliseconds to Millennia \nBy Geoffrey West \n[US — Penguin Press, UK — Weidenfeld & Nicolson, Holland — Het Spectrum, Finland — Terra Cognita, \nBrazil — Das Letras; Japan — Hayakawa; Korea — Gimm Young; Taiwan — Locus; China — CITIC; Russia \n— Atticus; Audio — Penguin RH; Manuscript; 400 pages; Publication: May 2017] \nThe former head of the Sante Fe Institute, visionary physicist Geoffrey West is a pioneer in the field of \ncomplexity science, the science of emergent systems and networks. The term \"complexity\" can be misleading, \nhowever, because what makes West's discoveries so beautiful is that he has found an underlying simplicity that \nunites the seemingly complex and diverse phenomena of living systems, including our bodies, our cities and our \nbusinesses. \nFascinated by issues of aging and mortality, West applied the rigor of a physicist to the biological question of \nwhy we live as long as we do and no longer. The result was astonishing and changed science, creating a new \nunderstanding of energy use and metabolism: West found that despite the riotous diversity in the sizes of \nmammals, they are all, to a large degree, scaled versions of each other. If you know the size of a mammal, you \ncan use scaling laws to learn everything from how much food it eats per day, what its heart-rate is, how long it \nwill take to mature, its lifespan, and so on. Furthermore, the efficiency of the mammal's circulatory systems \nBrockman, Inc. Frankfurt 2016 Hotlist \n-14-\nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 025160 \nscales up precisely based on weight: If you compare a mouse, a human and an elephant on a logarithmic graph, \nyou find with every doubling of average weight, a species gets 25% more efficient—and lives 25% longer. This \nspeaks to everything from how long we can expect to live to how many hours of sleep we need. Fundamentally, \nhe has proven, the issue has to do with the fractal geometry of the networks that supply energy and remove \nwaste from the organism's body. \nWest's work has been game-changing for biologists, but then he made the even bolder move of exploring his \nwork's applicability to cities. Cities, too, are constellations of networks and laws of scalability relate with eerie \nprecision to them. For every doubling in a city's size, the city needs 15% less road, electrical wire, and gas \nstations to support the same population. More amazingly, for every doubling in size, cities produce 15% more \npatents and more wealth, as well as 15% more crime and disease. This broad pattern lays the groundwork for a \nnew science of cities. \nRecently, West has applied his revolutionary work on cities and biological life to the business world. This \ninvestigation has led to powerful insights into why some companies thrive while others fail. The implications of \nthese discoveries are far-reaching, and are just beginning to be explored. \nScale is a thrilling scientific adventure story about the elemental natural laws that bind us together in simple but \nprofound ways. Through the brilliant mind of Geoffrey West, we can envision how cities, companies and \nbiological life alike are dancing to the same simple, powerful tune, however diverse and unrelated they are to \neach other. \nGEOFFREY WEST, a theoretical physicist, is distinguished professor and past president at Santa Fe Institute. \nHis primary interests have been in fundamental questions in physics and biology. West is a Senior Fellow at Los \nAlamos National Laboratory and a distinguished professor at the Sante Fe Institute, where he served as the \npresident from 2005-2009. He has been featured in many publications world-wide including the New York \nTimes, Nature, Science, the Financial Times, Wired and Scientific American, and has participated in television \nproductions including Nova, the National Geographic and the BBC. His work on cities and companies was \nselected as a breakthrough idea of 2007 by Harvard Business Review, and in 2006 he was selected for Time \nMagazine's list of \"100 Most Influential People in the World.\" \nFUNDAMENTALS \n(working title) \nBy Frank Wilczek Herman Feshbach Professor of Physics, MIT \nRecipient, 2004 Nobel Prize in Physics \n[US — Penguin Press, UK — Allen Lane, Audio — Penguin RH; Proposal; 50,000 words; Delivery: March \n2019] \nAn exciting new book by Frank Wilczek, one of the world's most eminent theoretical physicists and the most \nimportant of his generation. His scientific work provides the basis for the LHC experiments at CERN. He has \nreceived many prizes for his work in physics, including the Nobel Prize (2004) for work he did as a graduate \nstudent at Princeton University, when he was twenty-one years old, and the King Faisal Prize in 2005. \nWrites Wilczek: \"The premise of the book is simple: I formulated ten basic propositions, which together convey \nthe core of what every thinking person should know about science. In Fundamentals, the ten basic propositions \nsupport a series of interesting and connected chapters, which give historical and cultural context, outline the \nevidence, and draw out the implications. I want the marketing of this book to be based on the following slogan: \n\"If you read just one book about science, this should be the one.\" \nHere are three examples of the ten basic propositions: \nBrockman, Inc. Frankfurt 2016 Hotlist \n-15-\nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 025161 \n1. The World Is Very Big \nOur neighborhood (Earth, Solar System, Milky Way). The accessible universe. How we measure large \ndistances. Consistency checks. The multitudes within. \n2. The World Is Very Old \nThe nature of time. How we measure the age of objects on Earth. What we mean by the age of the \nuniverse, and how we measure it. Consistency checks. \n3. Matter Is Built From A Small Menu Of Ingredients, Which Exist In Vast Quantities \nMicroscopy and its modern refinements. Matter from the bottom up—building from electrons, photons, \nnuclei (protons and neutrons) to everyday materials. How we analyze the chemistry of distant objects, \nlike stars, and establish that they're made of the same stuff. Extraordinary objects. \nFundamentals is a short, sophisticated book that the explains fundamentals of science. \nFRANK WILCZEK won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2004 for work he did as a graduate student. His 1989 \nbook, Longing for the Harmonies, was a New York Times notable book of the year.

L. & Criminology 59, *102\n\nIn other words, while few state judiciaries have addressed the precise timing of state crime victims’ rights, those that have\naddressed the question have typically found that the rights do extend to pre-charging situations.\n\nDespite the relative dearth of state court cases, it is worth noting that most state statutes unequivocally provide for notification\nrights early in the criminal process. 7>! For example, the Illinois statute imposes a limited duty on law enforcement agencies to\nkeep victims mformed of the status of an investigation until the accused is apprehended or the agency discontinues the\ninvestigation. *°? Similarly, law enforcement agencies in Iowa must keep the victim apprised of the investigation \"until the\nalleged assailant is apprehended or the investigation is closed.\" 7°? Michigan's statute requires law enforcement to provide\ninformation within a mere twenty-four hours of contact between the agency and the victim. 74\n\nIn sum, while state law on crime victims' rights before charging is not fully developed, what law exists tends to support the\nposition that crime victims deserve rights before the formal filing of charges. This law fits the long-standing trend in states\ntoward expanding protections for crime [*103] victims. *°° The decision by state legislators to extend notification or\nconferral rights to crime victims demonstrates an express recognition that crime victims' meaningful participation in the\ncriminal justice process may involve granting those victims rights before indictment.\n\nConclusion\n\nCrime victims have important rights at stake in the criminal justice process, even before prosecutors formally file criminal\ncharges. It is hardly surprising, therefore, to find that a federal law that Congress in fact designed to create \"broad and\nencompassing\" rights for victims protects victims during a criminal investigation. As this Article has explained, interpreting the\nCVRA to cover crime victims during the pre-charging phase of a case is consistent with the statute's purposes, text, legislative\nhistory, and interpretive case law. And state criminal justice systems also appear to be moving in that direction.\n\nThe Justice Department's contrary interpretation seems unlikely to prevail when challenged. The CVRA signals a paradigm\nshift in the way that crime victims are to be treated, at least within the federal criminal justice system. Before enactment of the\nlaw, federal investigators and prosecutors might have been able to keep victims at arm's length, refusing to confer with them\nabout the case and otherwise ignoring or even mistreating them during the process. But those days are over. The CVRA\npromises victims that they now have the right to confer with prosecutors and the right to be treated fairly while their cases are\ninvestigated. It is time for the Department of Justice to recognize and embrace that new reality.\n\nJournal of Criminal Law & Criminology\n\n249 See Ex parte Littlefield, 540 S.E.2d 81, 85 (S.C. 2000).\n\n250 See Kimberly J.

There could be no better foundation for the next phase of my\ncareer—teaching law students at the nation’s largest and most prestigious law school, Harvard.\n\nBefore I leave the Supreme Court, I must recount one vignette regarding Justice Goldberg that\ncaused me considerable disappointment. One of the great villains of the day to all liberals was J.\nEdgar Hoover, the head of the FBI. On several occasions, I let my negative views about Hoover\nbe known to Goldberg, but he never said a word. I didn’t understand why. A few years later, I\nasked Bazelon, who smiled, and said “I probably shouldn’t tell you, but it’s important for you to\nknow that there are no perfect heroes.” He continued, “Hoover and Goldberg got along well,\nbecause when Goldberg was the lawyer for the labor movement, he worked hard to rid the C.I.O.\nof Communist influence.” I asked whether that meant he informed on Communist with the Union.\nBazelon replied, “I wouldn’t use the word informed, but he worked closely with Hoover on a\ncommon goal: to rid the C.I.O. of Communist influence.”\n\nBazelon then told me that Thurgood Marshall had played a similar role with regard to the\nNAACP-—trying to cleanse it of Communist influences.”\n\n“That’s how Thurgood and Arthur made it to the Court. If Hoover had opposed them, they\nmight not have been appointed.”\n\nI was shocked. “But there have been other liberals appointed as well,” I insisted.\n\n“Yes, Douglas, but he was Joe Kennedy’s boy, and Hoover liked Joe Kennedy, at least back in the\nday when Douglas was appointed. With Hoover, it wasn’t so much what you believed as were\nyou with Hoover or against him.”\n\n“What about Justice Brennan?,” I asked.\n\n“Bill was an accident, an Eisenhower mistake. They didn’t know he would be so liberal.\nEisenhower regarded Warren and Brennan as his worst mistakes.”\n\nBazelon then paused and said he would tell me something else, if I promised to keep it a secret\nuntil Goldberg and Marshall were both dead. I promised.\n\n“Hoover had something on both of them.”\n“What?” I asked.\n\n“Goldberg apparently had a brief ‘friendship’ with some European woman who may have been a\nRussian spy.

Shortly after we’d\nabandoned the idea of a military strike, I raised head-on my objections to the\nskewed image Bibi was promoting of our country. It wasn’t just inaccurate, I said.\nEspecially when his rhetoric was in full flight, and he compared the prospect of a\nnuclear Iran to a new “Holocaust,” it struck me as a betrayal of the core tenet of\nZionism: an state in which Jews were in control of their own destiny. “We are in\nthat position now,” I said. It was nonsensical to argue we were so threatened by\neverything around us, for instance, that we couldn’t “risk” taking the initiative\nrequired to disentangle ourselves from the Palestinians on the West Bank. “I don’t\nget you,” I said, turning to Lieberman as well. “Your rhetoric suggests you have\nspines of steel. But your behavior is living proof of the old saying that it’s easier to\ntake Jews out of the ga/ut, than take the galut out of the Jews.” Galut is Hebrew for\nthe diaspora. “The whole Zionist project was based on the idea of taking our fate\ninto our own hands, and actively trying to change the reality around us. But you\nbehave as if we never left the ga/ut. You’re mired in a mindset of pessimism,\npassivity and anxiety, which in terms of policy or action, leads to paralysis. Of\ncourse, there are risks in any action, or any policy initiative. But in the situation\nwhere Israel finds itself, the biggest risk of all is being unable or unwilling to take\nrisks, as 1f we somehow on the brink of destruction.”\n\nI was especially upset by Bibi’s increasingly use of Holocaust imagery. “Just\nthink of what you’re saying,” I told him. ““You’re Prime Minister of the State of\nIsrael, not a rabbi in a shfet/, or a speaker trying to raise funds for Israel abroad.\nThink of the implications. We’re not in Europe in 1937. Or 1947. If it is a\n‘Holocaust,’ what’s our response: to fold up and go back to the diaspora? If Iran\ngets a bomb, it’ll be bad. Very bad. But we’ll still be here. And we’ ll find a way of\ndealing with the new reality.”\n\nYet “fortress Israel” was irresistibly comfortable for Bibi politically. I now had\nto accept that, while he and I had known each other for more than half-a-century,\nnothing I could do or say was going to change that. With the next Israeli election\nmonths away, in January 2013, I confided to Nili, and then to my closest aides, that\nI was not going to run for a seat in the Knesset.

As of early 2011, some where between\n900,000 to over a million soldiers and civilians have died in Afghanistan and Iraq due to the war. This is\nexcessive. This is no longer revenge. This is senseless brutality.\n\nOn one reading, Pope Benedict XVI kept his knowledge of pedophilic priests quiet and\nconfidential in order to forgive them and protect the church. But this seemingly benign desire led to a\ndisaster, one that was foreseeable: continued sexual assault on thousands of innocent children and for\nmany, a loss of trust in the church and their moral and spiritual leader.\n\nDiscoveries by molecular biologists, neuroscientists, and psychologists reveal important\nindividual differences in our capacity to fuel desire, differences that constrain the paths we take from birth\nuntil our last breath. Some individuals are more risk-prone, some are impatient, and some gain a greater\nhit of dopamine in anticipation of reward, thereby doping themselves on the brain’s pharmaceutical\nofferings. Some are born with a set of genes that diminish the capacity for self-control. These individuals\nstart with lower levels of serotonin. These individuals, if raised by abusive parents, have a higher\nprobability of taking someone’s head off if they are challenged. Some individuals are born with low\nstress levels. These individuals are more likely to be sensation-seekers, voracious desirers who will stop\nat nothing less than the spectacular, even if this means the spectacularly violent. None of these biological\ncatalysts operate in a vacuum. All of these biological catalysts feed off of particular environments that we\ncreate. Geological and climatic factors create savannahs, oceans, and mountains. We create slums,\nrefugee camps, and totalitarian regimes. We are responsible for creating toxic environments and equally\nresponsible for cleaning them up. How we think about individual responsibility in cases of brain damage,\ndevelopmental disorders or innate differences in the starting state of our neurochemistry is a different\nproblem, one that I will touch upon in the last section.\n\nDenial. We all engage in it, at least some of the time. Like the psychology of desire, our\nengagement with denial is sometimes benign and often beneficial as a coping mechanism. We\ndehumanize in order to buffer ourselves from the pain of another’s pain. We self-deceive in the service of\nboosting self-confidence and self-esteem. When doctors turn their patients into machines that require\nrepair, they have deployed an adaptive mechanism that keeps empathy at bay when it is unnecessary.\nGood doctors, the ones that we all want, turn empathy back on when their patients awake from surgery,\nflesh and blood pulsating, thoughts and emotions humming. Bad doctors never turn empathy back on.\nEvil doctors, such as Carl Clauberg who injected liquid acid in the uterus of Jewish prisoners as part of a\nNazi inspired sterilization program, not only lack empathy for their patients, but see them as vermin or\nparasites that require extermination in the name of science and the preservation of our species. Denial has\ntransformed other human beings into nonhuman forms, from inert objects to wild animals and parasites.\nDenial has allowed military leaders and airplane pilots to ignore clear signs of trouble, marching\nthousands to their death. When this happens, moral responsibility checks out. Denial provides individuals\nand nations with a certified license to maim, rape, burn, mutilate and kill without feeling guilt, shame or\nremorse.\n\nAs with desire, the sciences provide a rich offering of evidence to explain how and why we\nengage in denial, either by means of dehumanizing others or self-deceiving ourselves. Both\ndehumanization and self-deception have a clear evolutionary logic. Dehumanization is a mechanism that\nenhances an individual’s competitive edge by making hatred and killing easier. Hatred and killing are the\nessential and ancient ingredients for defending the in-group and effacing the out-group. Sometimes,\nsoldiers would rather avoid killing the enemy. But when dehumanization of the enemy takes hold in the\nmind of a soldier or civilian, killing is not only easy, but addictive. The brain’s inhibitory mechanisms,\nprocessed by circuitry in the frontal lobes, shut down. Other brain regions involved in working out what\npeople believe and intend, enter into hibernation. With these circuits on leave, so too is our moral\nconscience. When the mind runs its dehumanization software, abstinence from killing is like withdrawal\nfrom a drug. Killing is satisfying. Killing is delicious.\n\nSelf-deception evolved in the service of deception. By functionally fooling ourselves into\nbelieving that we are stronger, wiser, and more competent, we can convince others to go along for the\nride, to work for us or work against a fictional enemy. Like dehumanization, this has both adaptive and\n\nHauser Epilogue.

In July 2009, Lindsay\nMills joined him there. She had become an amateur photographer,\nspecializing in arty self-portraits. She also saw herself as a global\ntourist, writing in her blog after arriving in Japan that she had trav-\neled to seventeen countries. Like Snowden, she also deemed herself,\ntongue in cheek, a “super hero.” In this sense, her Internet avatar\nwas a match for Snowden’s Wolfking Awesomefox.\n\nIn Japan, Mills and Snowden spent time with another Ameri-\ncan couple, Jennie and Joseph Chamberlin, who also worked at the\nYokota base. Jennie, a sergeant in the public affairs section of the U.S.\nAir Force, had been at art college with Mills and called herself in her\nblog the Little Red Ninja. Joseph Chamberlin was a decorated U.S.\nNavy pilot who now flew highly sensitive intelligence-gathering\nmissions from the Yokota base. Jennie described Lindsay in her blog\nas her “super-model friend.” The two couples also went on expedi-\ntions in Japan together. As far as is known, the Chamberlins were\nthe only Americans at the base with whom Snowden socialized. On\nAugust 17, 2009, the foursome attempted to walk up Mount Fuji,\n\n® but they got lost en route and wound up in the Mount Fuji gift ©\nshop. Jennie described the misadventure in her blog: “Our adven-\nture started off a little rocky with our attempts to find the interstate.\nAlas, our iconic mountain was obscured by cloud. A short stop at\nthe Mt. Fuji combination soba noodle stand/gift shop was enough to\nwhet our appetite for the further exploration that is to come.” Pho-\ntographs taken that day show Snowden wearing Hawaiian shorts\nand a black tank top emblazoned with an eagle and the letters USA.\nThey also show Mills wearing safari shorts, a brown sweater, and\nwhat appears to be an engagement ring. “Ed was looking rather red-\nnecky,” Lindsay commented on one photograph. Snowden described\nher, in turn, as “nerdy.” They never made it to the top of Mount Fuji.\n\nSnowden also sought to advance himself by getting credit toward\na college certificate by enrolling in a summer online course at the\nUniversity of Maryland’s Asia program, which had a regional cam-\npus on the Yokota base. Known as UMUC, it had a contract with\nthe government to provide military personnel with such educa-\ntional opportunities.

I am responsible for what I do, but\nI'm not responsible for what he does. I am responsible for how I treat his spouse, but I\ncan't be responsible for how he treats his spouse.\n\nBut what if I'm already friends with someone, and one of my partners gets involved with\nthat person? Do I have special responsibilities in that case? I'm still figuring that one out.\n\n2. When is it actually the best time to start talking about polyamory and setting out\nrelationship definitions? My approach so far has been to put poly on the table during\ninitial conversations, and then talk about it more when the topic of the relationship comes\nup. But I've been thinking lately that I probably should go into more detail sooner,\nbecause people have such different stereotypes of open relationships that I can't be sure\nthey're on board with what I'm talking about unless we've discussed polyamory in-depth.\n\nI feel like I talk to a lot of people who think they want a supposedly \"polyamorous”\nrelationship because they see it as a no-strings-attached free-for-all, and that's definitely\nnot what I want. Or I talk to people who back away from polyamory for the same reason.\nI see polyamory as being about more commitment to relationship negotiation, not less. I\nsee it as being about setting individual boundaries, if necessary -- it's not about having no\nboundaries. I see it as being about creating a secure situation for all parties involved --\nnot making anyone insecure, or ignoring anyone's needs. And being polyamorous doesn't\nmake my relationships unimportant to me. Being in love doesn't seem at odds with\npolyamory for me.\n\nThis is a hard thing to communicate in a small dose, though, especially if I'm dealing\nwith someone who has minimal exposure to the concept. On the other hand, having a\nSerious Conversation about polyamory on the first date is a bit much.\n\n3. Is it a good idea for me to get involved with guys who ultimately want\nmonogamy? As I noted earlier, I might compromise to monogamy eventually, but poly is\na priority for me. (Who knows, maybe I'll decide it's my ideal relationship formation\nagain someday. This seems unlikely to me right now, but anything's possible.)\n\nBut what if I get really into a guy who ultimately plans to be monogamous? Is this a bad\ncall on my part? On the one hand, if I go on a few dates with a 28-year-old guy who\ndoesn't want to get married until his mid-30s but definitely wants a monogamous\nmarriage when he does... I mean, why not have a relationship? On the other hand, I may\nbe setting myself up for heartbreak in such situations, if he basically sees our relationship\nas \"not real” from the start. This brings me to my next point...\n\n4. Some people see polyamory as a sign of commitment-phobia. I've made this\nmistake myself -- in fact, the \"polyamory as commitment-phobia\" stereotype is so strong\nthat I've occasionally reversed it and wondered if my desire for it was a sign of\ncommitment-phobia. But the fact is, my appreciation for polyamory only increased as I\nbecame more certain about what I'm seeking in a partner, and as I gained more\nunderstanding of how to negotiate that. It's come along with relationship confidence and\nunderstanding.\n\nI feel pretty okay with believing in commitment in the context of polyamory.

Every year at Thanksgiving’, we look in-depth at an issue that affects markets and\nportfolios. Last year, we examined the unraveling situation in Europe. Unfortunately, most concerns we expressed last year\nhave been borne out, and are getting much worse (I spent the weekend reading legal documents on a Eurozone break-up, just in\ncase). Like Don Quixote, Europe went on its journey for all the wrong reasons, adopting a half-pregnant monetary union to\nsupport a political objective that had arguably already been achieved by 1955”. This year, a look at something just as worrying\nin the long run as the fiscal problems of the West: the search for energy solutions. This journey has been fraught with\nsimilarly quixotic dead ends, fairy tales and blunders ignoring economic (and thermodynamic) realities. This is important to us,\nsince energy cost and availability is central to how we think about growth, profits, stability and our portfolio investments.\n\nAs part of this effort, I made a pilgrimage to Manitoba to spend a day with Vaclav Smil. Vaclav is one of the world’s foremost\nexperts on energy, and has written over 30 books and 300 papers on the subject (he’s #49 on Foreign Policy’s list of the 100\nmost influential thinkers). Vaclav’s book “Energy Myths and Realities” should be required reading for politicians or regulators\nimpacting energy policy. We start with an unflinching look at these realities before turning to solutions, and some potentially\nencouraging developments, which have less to do with how electricity is generated, and more to do with how it might be stored.\n\n“A dream is a wish your heart makes” (Cinderella)\n\nOver the last 50 years, a lot of proposed solutions have not panned out as expected. While the process of discovery and\ninvention always includes large doses of failure, energy policy is different than say, cell phones or VCRs, since more public\nmoney, time and effort are spent on them. Hopes are raised, and as a result, less flashy but more reliable solutions are\nsometimes postponed or avoided altogether. Here are a few memorable predictions of our energy future:\n\ne 1945, Oak Ridge National Laboratory nuclear physicists Weinberg and Soodak predict that nuclear breeders will be man’s ultimate\nenergy source; a decade later, the chairman of the US Atomic Energy Commission predict it would be “too cheap to meter”\n\ne /973. “Let this be our national goal: At the end of this decade, in the year 1980, the United States will not be dependent on any other\ncountry for the energy we need to provide our jobs, to heat our homes, and to keep our transportation moving.” Richard Nixon\n\ne 1/978. “Through modeling of supply and demand for over 200 US utilities it was projected that, by the year 2000, almost 60% of US\n\ncars could be electrified, and that only 17% of the recharging power would come from petroleum.”\n\n1979. An influential Harvard Business School study projects that by 2000, the US could satisfy 20% of its energy needs through solar\n\n1980. Physicist Bent Sorenson predicts that 49% of America’s energy could come from renewable sources by the year 2005\n\n1994. Hypercar Center established, whose lightweight material and design would yield 200 mpg cars with a 95% decline in pollution\n\n1994. InterTechnology Corporation predicts that solar energy would supply 36% of America’s industrial process heat by 2000\n\n1995. Energy consultant and physicist Alfred Cavallo projects that wind could have a capacity factor of 60%, which when combined\n\nwith compressed air storage, would rise to 70 — 95%\"\n\n1999. US Department of Energy hopes to sequester | billion tonnes of carbon per year by 2025\n\ne 2000. Fuel cell companies announce 250-kilowatt production plants that can fit into a conference room and produce energy at 10 cents\nper kilowatt hour, with the goal of 6 cents by 2003\n\ne 2008. “Today I challenge our nation to commit to producing 100% of our electricity from renewable energy and truly clean carbon-free\nsources within 10 years. This goal 1s achievable, affordable and transformative.” Al Gore\n\ne 2009. Gene scientist Craig Venter announces plans to develop next-generation biofuels from algae in a partnership with Exxon Mobil\n\nHow have things turned out? There are no commercial nuclear breeders on anyone’s horizon; global nuclear capacity is only\n20% of the Atomic Energy Agency’s 1970 forecast; the Hypercar is nowhere to be seen; solar and wind make up a miniscule\nportion of US electricity generation; wind capacity factors range from 20%-30%; the US is reliant for 50% of its oil from\nforeign sources; 70% of US electricity generation comes from coal and natural gas; fuel cells haven’t worked as expected;\nhybrids are 2% of US car sales; “clean coal” is mostly a blueprint; and Venter announced that his team failed to find naturally\noccurring algae that can be converted into commercial-scale biofuel (they will now work with synthetic strains instead)’.\n\n\" Some clients tell me it is helpful to have something to read this weekend, when/if family gatherings become unwieldy, or aggravating.\n\n* A few years ago, Swedish and Dutch politicians mobilizing support for the EU Constitution referred to “Yes” votes as necessary tribute to\nthe dead from the Second World War, and more urgently, to avoid the pre-war divisions which led to it. Conflict between European empires\nexisted for hundreds of years (1871-1914 was the only period of peace until 1945), so the idea of a united Europe would have seemed\nappealing in 1945. However, conditions for securing a lasting peace within Western Europe were arguably already in place by 1954.\n\n* A 2005 paper from Stanford raised expectations further by estimating theoretical wind power at 72 TW, 30x global electricity production.\n\n* Algae are inefficient photosynthetic reactors (they do not consume CO, when the sun isn’t shining), and allocate only a tiny fraction of\ncaptured solar energy into lipid production. A 2007 study by Krassen Dimitrov at the University of Queensland predicted GreenFuel’s\ndemise in advance, claiming that the company estimated its photosynthetic efficiency at almost double the maximum theoretical rate, and\ncould only be profitable at $800 per barrel of oil. Genetic improvements of plant life have historically focused on disease resistance and\nmodifying the split between production of “fruit vs. stem”; it is used less often to increase growth rates of biomass itself.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_030814\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

CERTAIN INVESTMENT CONSIDERATIONS\n\nAn investment in the Fund entails a significant degree of risk and, therefore, should be undertaken only\nby investors capable of evaluating the risks of the Fund and bearing the risks it represents. There can be\nno assurance that the Fund's investment objectives will be achieved or that an investor will receive a\nreturn of its capital, and therefore, an investor should only invest in the Fund if such investor is able to\nwithstand a total loss of its investment. In addition, there will be occasions when the General Partner\nand its affiliates may encounter potential conflicts of interest in connection with the Fund. Prospective\ninvestors in the Fund should carefully consider the following factors in connection with an investment in\nthe Fund. The following is not a complete list of all risks involved in connection with an investment in\nthe Fund. In addition to the items discussed below, prospective investors should also consider the\ninformation described in Section XI, “Certain Tax & ERISA Considerations” and elsewhere in this\nMemorandum. Prospective investors are cautioned not to rely on the prior returns set forth in this\nMemorandum in making a decision whether or not to purchase the Limited Partner Interests offered\nhereby. The return information contained in this Memorandum has not been audited or verified by any\nindependent party and should not be considered representative of the returns that may be received by an\ninvestor in the Fund. Past performance is not a guarantee of future results.\n\nRisk of Venture Capital Investments\n\nWhile venture capital investments offer the opportunity for significant gains, such investments\nalso involve a high degree of business and financial risk and can result in substantial losses.\nAmong these risks are the general risks associated with investing in companies at an early state\nof development or with little or no operating history, companies operating at a loss or with\nsubstantial variations in operating results from period to period, and companies with the need\nfor substantial additional capital to support expansion or to achieve or maintain a competitive\nposition. Such companies may face intense competition, including from companies with greater\nfinancial resources, more extensive development, manufacturing, marketing and service\ncapabilities and a larger number of qualified managerial and technical personnel. Due to the\nlimited number of investments that the Fund may make, poor performance by some of the\nFund’s investments could significantly affect the total returns to Limited Partners.\n\nFocused Investment Strategy\n\nThe Fund will be focused on life sciences and healthcare technology investments and may not\nenjoy the reduced risks of a broadly diversified portfolio. A specific investment focus is\ninherently more risky and could cause the Fund’s investments to be more susceptible to\nparticular economic, political, regulatory, technological or industry conditions or occurrences\ncompared with a fund, or a portfolio of funds, that is more diversified or has a broader industry\nfocus.\n\nRisks Associated with Investments in Life Sciences and Healthcare Technology Companies\n\nThe success of the Fund’s portfolio companies may be dependent upon obtaining certain\ngovernmental approvals. Companies in the life sciences and healthcare technology industry\ntypically require the approval of agencies such as the FDA prior to marketing their products to\nthe public. Of particular significance are the FDA requirements covering research and\ndevelopment, testing, manufacturing, quality control, labeling and promotion of drugs for\nhuman use. The approval process is very lengthy and very costly, and there can be no\nguarantee that a portfolio company will obtain the necessary approvals for its products. If a\nportfolio company is unable to obtain these approvals in a timely fashion, the portfolio\n\n58 CONTROL NUMBER 257 - CONFIDENTIAL\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_024069\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

The reality is that\nI stumbled onto the brain's innate optimism by accident. After living\nthrough Sept. 11, 2001, in New York City, I had set out to investigate\npeople's memories of the terrorist attacks. I was intrigued by the fact\nthat people felt their memories were as accurate as a videotape, while\noften they were filled with errors. A survey conducted around the\ncountry showed that 11 months after the attacks, individuals'\nrecollections of their experience that day were consistent with their\ninitial accounts (given in September 2011) only 63% of the time.\nThey were also poor at remembering details of the event, such as the\nnames of the airline carriers. Where did these mistakes in memory\ncome from?\n\nScientists who study memory proposed an intriguing answer:\nmemories are susceptible to inaccuracies partly because the neural\nsystem responsible for remembering episodes from our past might not\nhave evolved for memory alone. Rather, the core function of the\nmemory system could in fact be to imagine the future — to enable us\nto prepare for what has yet to come. The system is not designed to\nperfectly replay past events, the researchers claimed. It is designed to\nflexibly construct future scenarios in our minds. As a result, memory\nalso ends up being a reconstructive process, and occasionally, details\nare deleted and others inserted. To test this, I decided to record the\nbrain activity of volunteers while they imagined future events — not\nevents on the scale of 9/11, but events in their everyday lives — and\ncompare those results with the pattern I observed when the same\nindividuals recalled past events. But something unexpected occurred.\nOnce people started imagining the future, even the most banal life\nevents seemed to take a dramatic turn for the better.

All are to some degree familiar,\nthough they are not usually described in these terms or understood as serving this common purpose.\n\nOne approach is creation of two distinct enforcement agencies with overlapping or duplicative jurisdiction.

Many multinationals’ foreign earnings thus remain parked offshore,\nallowing corporations to avoid the tax hit associated with bringing them back to the US.\nBoth Trump and the House (under Ryan) have proposed a mandatory tax of overseas\nearnings of US firms’ foreign subsidiaries at reduced rates, such that this cash can be\nbrought back and put to work in the US. This differs from the 2004 repatriation tax\nholiday, which was optional.\n\nUnder the Blueprint, accumulated overseas earnings will be subject to a transition tax of\n8.75%! (for those held in cash/cash equivalents) or 3.5% (for all other holdings), with\ncompanies able to pay the tax liability over an eight-year period. This would be part of\nbroader tax reform, where a proposed territorial tax system would exempt companies’\nforeign income from US taxes and prevent future buildup of overseas profits as\ncompanies would be free to bring them home. Trump’s plan calls for a one-time deemed\nrepatriation of overseas corporate profits at a 10% tax rate.\n\nTable 6: Blueprint vs. Trump tax plans for taxing offshore earnings of US firms’ foreign subsidiaries\n\nPlan Tax rate on accumulated overseas earnings\nBlueprint 8.75% for cash/cash equivalents, 3.5% of all other holdings\nTrump tax plan 10%\n\nSource: donaldjtrump.com, abetterway.speaker.gov\n\nThe Tax Policy Center estimates that a repatriation tax holiday would generate\napproximately $150bn in tax receipts under Trump’s plan (over 10 years) and $140bn\n\n' Note: The effective tax rates of 8.75% and 3.5% under the Blueprint are based on an allowable deduction of 75% (for\ndeferred earnings held in cash/liquid assets) or 90% (for the non-cash portion), with the remainder taxed at the US\ncorporate tax rate, Le. 35%(1-75%) = 8.75% and 35%(1-90%) = 3.5%.

The vast majority of our students are no\nlonger the white American males that dominated the classroom in the early 1960s. Nearly half the\nclass is comprised of women, about a quarter of the class of racial and ethnic minorities, and\napproximately 10% from foreign countries. This increased diversity brings with it a wide range of\nviewpoints and experiences that enrich the class discussion.\n\nToday’s students are also older, with more work experience. They come to the classroom with\nfirm, if not always clear, views of who they are and what they want to be. They are not the naive,\nsycophantic, uncritical consumers that characterized my generation of students right out of\ncollege. This is all good, because it makes teaching them more challenging.\n\nEqually important has been the globalization of law over the past quarter decade. When I began\nteaching, all law, like all politics, was local. Today, virtually all law is global. A typical case that\ncomes across my desk and that I now teach about is as follows:\n\nA man born in Israel becomes a British citizen and moves to Houston where he works for\na multinational firm which allegedly paid a bribe to an African prince from one country to\nbuild a gas facility in another African country using French funds transmitted from a Swiss\nbank. The person is now in Canada and the United States and Great Britain are both\nseeking his extradition. The laws of each of the countries differ considerably as to what\nconstitutes a bribe, as distinguished from a proper or merely unethical payment. The laws\nof each country also differ as to the propriety of preparing witnesses and gathering\nevidence.\n\nA lawyer confronting this kind of case must know how to deal with these transnational problems.\nLaw schools have traditionally offered courses in international law, teaching the students about\ninternational tribunals and treaties. The source of problems confronted today are not decided by\ninternational law or international courts. They are transnational, rather than international, in\nnature and require an ability to navigate the very different terrains of many nations’ legal systems.\n\nAmong the areas of law in which political and legal boundaries are frequently crossed, are:\ninternet law, environmental law, antitrust law, corporate law, criminal law and many newly\nemerging fields of law. We are just beginning to teach our students how to practice in this global\nenvironment. We must do more if we are to stay ahead of major changes and prepare our\nstudents to be great lawyers through the middle of the 21* Century.\n\nI have been privileged to teach nearly 10,000 students over my half century career as a law\nprofessor. Among the students I have taught, mentored, advised and encountered have been\nPresidents, Supreme Court justices, judges, senators, congressmen, corporate CEO, deans,\nprofessors, university presidents, journalists and other movers and shakers. With the privileges of\nteaching tomorrow’s world leaders comes enormous responsibilities. Among these\nresponsibilities is not to use the classroom to propagandize one’s captive audience. My goal is\nnot to turn conservatives into liberals, but to make conservatives more thoughtful conservatives,\n\n82\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_017169\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

It was a great joke. Everybody laughed.’ After this, Virginia was paid, by Epstein, around\n$400 (£250).’\n\nShe met Andrew for the third and final time on Epstein’s Caribbean island, Little Saint James.\nVirginia was never under the British legal age of consent when she met Andrew. She was 17 during\nthe first two encounters and 18 at the third.\n\nBy now, however, Epstein, had started to hint that she was getting ‘too old’ for him.\n\nBut during one trip to the island, Epstein and Ghislaine made their most astonishing proposition, and\none which repulsed her. ‘They said Jeffrey wanted me to have his child,’ she says.\n\n‘They said | was part of their family and | was beautiful,young, loyal and nurturing and would be a\ngreat mother.\n\nThey said | would have to sign a contract relinquishing rights to the child and consenting to Jeffrey\nhaving as many relationships as he liked. In return | would have my own mansion in Palm Beach\nand a large monthly payment, a percentage of his income.’\n\nThis, finally, was a wake-up call to Virginia and she began to see the way in which she had been\ngroomed.\n\n‘It was a smack in the face,’ she says. ‘I finally realised this wasn’t ever going to be a real\nrelationship but | knew if | refused, I'd be thrown back on the streets. So | said, “I'm too yaung. |\nwant to get my massage credentials, then maybe we'll do it”.’\n\nThe tycoon took her at her word and, for her 19th birthday in August 2002, flew her to Thailand\nwhere he enrolled her in a massage course.\n\nShortly after arriving there, she met an Australian martial arts expert called Robert. They fell in love\nand, just ten days later, married in a Buddhist ceremony.\n\n‘| cailed Jeffrey and told him I'd fallen madly in love,’ Virginia says. ‘| was hoping he’d be delighted.\nBut he said, “Have a nice life,” and hung up on me.’ The couple now have two sons, aged five and\nfour, and a daughter who recently turned one.\n\n‘The first few months ajter | married Robert were the worst,’ she says. ‘I couldn’t bring myself to tell\nhim much. No man wants to know his wife has been traded out.\n\n‘I felt very alone. | was having panic attacks and seeing a psychiatrist and was on anti-depressants.\n\n‘ Virginia was beginning to put her Epstein days behind her when, three years ago, she was phoned\nby the FBI.\n\nhttp:/Avww.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1361039/Prince-Andrew-girl-17-sex-offender-friend-flew-Britain-meet-him html\n\nL:1SECROTR SH RIV’.

Citing an \nallegation in -legal papers from a woman (who later dropped her lawsuit) that Donald \nTrump and Epstein had raped her when she was 13, Bannon said in response to Ivanka, \n\"What about the allegations about her dad and that 13-year-old?\" \nEpstein has previously used his millions to cultivate the world's most powerful — but has \nmostly given money to Democrats. \nFrom 2001 to 2003, Bill Clinton flew on Epstein's private plane, dubbed \"The Lolita \nExpress,\" 26 times. Epstein is close to Prince Andrew and was a regular at Trump's Mar-\na-Lago. \nTrump told New York magazine of Epstein in 2002, \"Terrific guy. He's a lot of fun to be \nwith. It is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do, and many of them are \non the younger side.\" \nEpstein, 65, pleaded guilty in 2008 to soliciting prostitution from a teen and served 13 \nmonths in jail. \nLast year, he reportedly paid millions to settle three lawsuits filed against him by teens. \nBannon's rep didn't comment.

He said that he prefers to do a \"per meet\" of $300 -- he called it\na \"per meet\" -- I told him that was too low and quoted him $1,000, and he said he'd meet\nme in the middle. Another guy told me that he would just slip $400 into my purse when\nhe saw me, and that's exactly what he did.\n\nI have one client I've never explicitly discussed money with at all. I had lunch with him,\nand we didn't negotiate anything, though we talked a little bit about our reasons for being\non the site. The next time I saw him -- we were deciding where to meet, and he asked if\nhe should get us a room. I said that I would like that, so I met him and we had sex. He\nknew it was my birthday soon, so as we were getting dressed, he said, \"I know we haven't\ntalked about money, so I got you some birthday spending money,\" and he handed me an\nenvelope with $400. The next time I saw him, he asked about my plans for the evening. I\nsaid I was having dinner with a friend, and he handed me $400 in an envelope and said,\n\"Maybe this will help pay for it.\" I'm lucky that I'm willing to accept $400 -- it's my\nlower bound, but I'm willing to accept it. Imagine if I hadn't been willing to take $400 --\nthat would be super awkward. Probably I should have negotiated that situation more\nclearly, but it worked out okay.\n\nI've heard about situations where unclear negotiations did not work out okay. There was a\nNew York Times Magazine article about the site published in 2009. In that article, there\nwere some examples of unclear negotiations that didn't work out well. But it sounded like\nthat woman didn't really know what she wanted, and didn't really enjoy the work. But I\ndo. And I know other women who do, too.\n\nI have a new client who paid me $3,000 up front to see me 3 times a month. But I haven't\nheard from him since our first meeting. If I were his girlfriend, I'd call him, but he asked\nme not to call him. So I don't really know what the deal with that one is. Maybe he's\ngonna flake out on me, but he already gave me $3,000, so that would be weird.\n\nClarisse Thorn: So, your husband. You mentioned him briefly. How does your\nhusband feel about this?\n\nOlivia: He does not seem particularly threatened. We already have an open relationship. I\nthink he sometimes feels very visceral jealousy, but that's just like any other time one of\nus has sex with somebody else. We just have to talk about it.\n\nPart of the deal here is that I'm doing this because I'm broke. My husband really wants to\nbe able to support me financially, but he can't right now, so I'm supporting both us doing\nthis. I think that's a real blow to his ego. To the extent that he gets bothered, I think it's\nbecause I'm allowing other men to support me and give me money; he doesn't care about\nthe sex. Even though I see this as work, he sees this as \"here's this rich successful guy\nwho just gave my wife a bunch of money, and she slept with him -- so probably she's\nattracted to him.\"\n\nI am kind of attracted to my clients, and I kind of get off on making them happy, and I\nhappen to think that the age difference is kind of hot. I like having sex with them; it's not\nunpleasant. I like hearing about these guys’ life stories. I think it's interesting. But these\nguys would never be a threat to my husband. I would never be sleeping with any of them\nexcept for the money. And I love my husband. I'm always very up front about the fact\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_018613\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

We call it a fight until the end.” He also issued a\ntransparent threat: “They should know when we suffer, we will not\nsuffer alone.”\n\nSome have suggested that the two messages reveal a split in the\nSyrian regime. That’s not convincing. The messages were not that\ndifferent, and to put Shaaban on the same level as Makhlouf is\nabsurd. Shaaban is viewed as a spokesman for the president, but she\nplays no central role in the Assad-Makhlouf constellation. She\ndoubtless needed a green light to go ahead with the interview, one\nthat required some measure of approval by Makhlouf and Assad’s\nyounger brother Maher, both of whom have taken an eradication\napproach to the protests. Makhlouf, in turn, needed no authorization\nwhatsoever.\n\nWhat Shaaban said was likely intended to be interpreted in the United\nStates as a marginally soft statement by Bashar Assad. In contrast,\nMakhlouf offered the harsher alternative if the president’s approach\nwas rejected by the international community. It was a classic good\ncop, bad cop routine, and those familiar with Syrian manners will be\nlittle surprised by the ploy. That’s why it seems far-fetched to assume\nthat we are witnessing a fundamental rift in Syria’s ruling family.\nThe reason for this is that there is no serious alternative to what the\nAssads and the Makhloufs are doing today. They can either stand\ntogether behind repression, or fall apart. That’s hardly to justify the\nregime’s butchery of hundreds of unarmed civilians. Rather, it’s to\naffirm that the Syrian leadership is incapable of undertaking anything\ndifferent. There simply is no reform option, and there never was.\nGenuine reform means dislodging the bricks holding up Assad-\nMakhlouf authority. Bashar Assad’s open-ended presidency, the\ncrony capitalism practiced by his cousin and other members of\nSyria’s elite, the abuse practiced by the all-powerful security services,\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_030078\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

While the club has existed in Mumbai since 2010, said Dnaval Udani, Givelndia’s\nCEO, this was their first foray into the capital city. Mint was the media partner of the event.\n\n“With this club, we wanted to create a platform for like-minded individuals to build a community of donors who share\nknowledge and vision; it will also help to facilitate giving effectively,” Udani told his audience. “Our aim is to help you get\nmore exposure and awareness of the different aspects of philanthropy; over the last three years this club has helped\nchannel more than Rs.18 crore to the lives of more than 10,000 underprivileged in India.”\n\nRakesh Bharti Mittal, vice-chairman and managing director of Bharti Enterprises, along with speakers Anu Aga of Thermax\nand Amit Chandra of Bain Capital gave their perspectives on how and where to give effectively and on the future of Indian\nphilanthropy. Edited excerpts:\n\nRakesh Mittal set up the Satya Bharti school programmes in 2006. The aim was to set up 500 primary and 50 secondary\nschools of its own with a corpus of Rs.200 crore. After that, state governments began reaching out and Bharti began\nadopting government schools, creating a public-private partnership in delivering quality education to rural children.\n\n“Given the new companies Bill, which has been passed by Parliament, | assume within the next two three months the rules\nwill be finalized; there is going to be a mad rush for seeking funding. Already, | get a letter every other day for supporting a\ncause...If | see corporates have been very powerful instruments and drivers of philanthropy, this comes from the wider\nwealth creation and management role which they do in their businesses. Today they are looking at doing more beyond\nbusiness, not because the government is forcing them, but because we cannot have islands of wealth. You cannot take this\ncountry forward if we are just worried about what | have and what | need for me and my family, and the ecosystem and the\nsociety around is crumbling. This country will not move forward.”\n\n“If | go back a few centuries giving had been a very rich tradition; it used to be that 10% of your income would be kept aside\nfor a cause. During those times more money went into either building temples or temples of learning, which are the schools\nand colleges. Pre-1990, Indian corporates were not giving that much, including the individuals, and there was a reason\nbecause we did not have sustainable wealth creation opportunities, either for ourselves, our families, or our large\nstakeholders as we were running the companies.\n\n“This all changed in the post-1991 year of liberalization. In the last two decades, more and more, new age economies moved\nthis country to prosperous economic growth and suddenly you saw people wanting to give back to society because now you\nhave a model which was creating sustainable wealth for yourself.”\n\n“There are individuals who may give money and their time, but there are also entrepreneurs, young entrepreneurs who\nproduce products which are low in cost but make a huge impact for the people who use it. This is the brief India is looking at\nin the landscape today and this will be a stepping stone for the future.”\n\n“Giving at Bharti has always been part of our DNA, it was always our endeavour to make a difference. At the beginning, in\nthe mid-70s, we were more interested in creating businesses which could impact society at large. If | look at telecom, retail,\nagri and food processing we wanted to make a difference and not a buck. In 2000 we set up Bharti Foundation with the sole\nobjective of supporting the youth of India and enabling the underprivileged to come and compete with anyone.\n\n“We started writing cheques and one day | felt that was not the purpose, the fact is there are 320 million children in the age of\n\n6-16, we talk of demographic dividend—absolutely yes, if we nurture this potential, but if we don’t do justice to these children\nthere is a disaster which is waiting to happen.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_028637\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

Wiener recognized the\nrole of feedback in machine learning, but he missed the key role of representation. It’s\nnot possible to store all possible images in a self-driving car, or all possible sounds in a\nconversational computer; they have to be able to generalize from experience. The “deep”\npart of deep learning refers not to the (hoped-for) depth of insight but to the depth of the\nmathematical network layers used to make predictions. It turned out that a linear increase\nin network complexity led to an exponential increase in the expressive power of the\nnetwork.\n\nIf you lose your keys in a room, you can search for them. If you’re not sure\nwhich room they’re in, you have to search all the rooms in a building. If you’re not sure\nwhich building they’re in, you have to search all the rooms in all the buildings in a city.\nIf you’re not sure which city they’re in, you have to search all the rooms in all the\nbuildings in all the cities. In AI, finding the keys corresponds to things like a car safely\nfollowing the road, or a computer correctly interpreting a spoken command, and the\nrooms and buildings and cities correspond to all of the options that have to be considered.\nThis is called the curse of dimensionality.\n\nThe solution to the curse of dimensionality came in using information about the\nproblem to constrain the search. The search algorithms themselves are not new. But\nwhen applied to a deep-learning network, they adaptively build up representations of\nwhere to search. The price of this is that it’s no longer possible to exactly solve for the\nbest answer to a problem, but typically all that’s needed is an answer that’s good enough.\n\nTaken together, it shouldn’t be surprising that these scaling laws have allowed\nmachines to become effectively as capable as the corresponding stages of biological\ncomplexity. Neural networks started out with a goal of modeling how the brain works.\nThat goal was abandoned as they evolved into mathematical abstractions unrelated to\nhow neurons actually function. But now there’s a kind of convergence that can be\nthought of as forward- rather than reverse-engineering biology, as the results of deep\nlearning echo brain layers and regions.\n\nOne of the most difficult research projects P ve managed paired what we’d now\ncall data scientists with AI pioneers. It was a miserable experience in moving goalposts.\nAs the former progressed in solving long-standing problems posed by the latter, this was\ndeemed to not count because it wasn’t accompanied by corresponding leaps in\nunderstanding the solutions. What’s the value of a chess-playing computer if you can’t\nexplain how it plays chess?\n\nThe answer of course is that it can play chess. There is interesting emerging\nresearch that is applying AI to AI—that is, training networks to explain how they operate.\nBut both brains and computer chips are hard to understand by watching their inner\nworkings; they’re easily interpreted only by observing their external interfaces. We come\nto trust (or not) brains and computer chips alike based on experience that tests them\nrather than on explanations for how they work.\n\nMany branches of engineering are making a transition from what’s called\nimperative to declarative or generative design. This means that instead of explicitly\ndesigning a system with tools like CAD files, circuit schematics, and computer code, you\ndescribe what you want the system to do and then an automated search is done for\ndesigns that satisfy your goals and restrictions. This approach becomes necessary as\ndesign complexity exceeds what can be understood by a human designer.

For instance, the pro-\ngovernment weekly Figyelo recently issued an enemies list of about 200 prominent opposition individuals. Most\nwere local civil society advocates, but the list also included U.S. citizens, many of them scholars of economics,\nJudaism and nationalism at the Soros-funded Central European University (such as Leon Botstein and Allen\nFeldman). The government has erected contrived legal barriers in an effort to close the institution, a graduate\nschool devoted to liberal values and based in Budapest. Meanwhile, Hungary harassed the U.S.-based Open Society\nFoundations until they decided to move their operations from Budapest to Berlin. Two Hungarian newspapers,\nMagyar Nemzet and Budapest Beacon , shut down this spring as advertisers vanished because of their opposition\nto the Hungarian government, leaving only one print opposition daily.\n\nThe State Department and the U.S. Embassy in Budapest have remained almost entirely silent about all of this.\nThe compliant new U.S. approach was initially discussed at a Dec. 18, 2017, meeting of the National Security\nCouncil’s policy coordinating committee led by Fiona Hill, the council’s senior director for European and Russian\naffairs, and Assistant Secretary Mitchell, according to two sources familiar with the proceedings. They concluded\nthat previous efforts under the Bush administration, and especially the Obama administration, had not paid off, so\nit was time to try something else.\n\nAccordingly, the first high-level meeting between the two sides took place at the White House on May 15, when John\nBolton, Trump’s national security adviser, received Jeno Megyesy, Orban’s chief adviser on the United States.\n(Megyesy was also the official point of contact for then-Trump aide Carter Page’s meetings in Budapest during the\ncampaign.) This coming week, Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto is scheduled to meet Secretary of State Mike\nPompeo; although Szijjarto has visited Washington an eye-popping seven times in the past 18 months, this will be\nthe first such high-level bilateral meeting since 2012. The only step left would be for Trump to receive Orban — the\nfirst European head of government to endorse Trump over Hillary Clinton and congratulate him on his victory — at\nthe White House.\n\nWhat, if anything, is the United States getting from Hungary for this appeasement? The $12 billion Russian-financed\nand secretly signed Russian Paks II nuclear plant in southern Hungary is one reflection of Orban’s Russian\norientation. (Orban previously welcomed energy investments from the now-failed Russian South Stream pipeline.)\nHungary spends only 1 percent of its gross domestic product on defense, among the lowest levels for NATO\nmembers, despite Trump’s insistence that nations step up their payments. (Budapest said last year that it would\nincrease spending, but it has said this many times before.)\n\nMany intelligent Hungarians — watching the complicity, or at least inaction, of the U.S. government — do not\nunderstand what is happening, they tell us. They know that Trump wants to be different from Barack Obama,\nincluding in his approach to Hungary. But they search in vain for logic in Trump’s posture. For those who still believe\nin the merits of a Western-style democracy there, which is a large majority in Budapest and a large minority in the\ncountryside, the policy of appeasement signifies abandonment. They would like Washington to keep hope alive.\nPeople who suffer from, or are ashamed by, the government’s anti-Semitic discourse and attacks on liberal norms\nlong for a different America.\n\nAnd there may be one. David Cornstein, the new U.S. ambassador to Hungary, who will arrive in Budapest in a few\nweeks, might make a difference. In his appearance before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee in early May, he\nspoke eloquently about promoting American values. He promised to fight against anti-Semitism, not just in Hungary\nbut elsewhere in Europe, too. His nice, old-fashioned remarks were even cleared by the State Department and the\nU.S. Embassy in Budapest. He received strong expressions of support from Republican and Democratic senators,\nincluding Sen. Benjamin Cardin (D-Md.), who is something of an expert on Hungarian politics. There is still hope,\nthen, that decent, humane values will be heard by Hungarians who, in search of answers, continue to look to the\nUnited States.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_033380\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

Mr. Thomas apparently stated that he understood that there was evidence\nthat the women had lied about their ages. AUSA Weinstein replied that this was not a\ndefense and that Mr. Thomas should not believe “the spin” of Mr. Epstein’s “high-priced\nattorneys.” Indeed, Mr. Weinstein told Mr. Thomas that the USAO was very concerned\nabout a Palm Beach editorial that questioned whether Mr. Epstein would receive a rich\nman’s justice. AUSA Weinstein then stated that, in fact, Mr. Epstein “doesn’t have a\ndefense.”\n\n47. Mr. Epstein’s attorneys learned of the call and complained to the USAO. Counsel for\nMr. Epstein then had an in-person meeting with FAUSA Sloman and United States\nAttorney Acosta describing these leaks to the New York Times. During Mr. Thomas’ next\ncall to the USAO, made two weeks later, AUSA Weinstein “admonished” him (in the\nwords of Mr. Thomas) for disclosing the contents of their prior conversation to the\ndefense, and strongly “reminded” Mr. Thomas that AUSA Weinstein’s prior comments\nabout Mr. Epstein had only been “hypothetical” in nature. That claim is sheer nonsense:\nAUSA Weinstein had disclosed specific details of Mr. Epstein’s case, including plea\nterms proposed by the defense, as revealed based on Mr. Thomas’s own\ncontemporaneous hand-written notes.\n\n48. Shortly thereafter, Mr. Sloman wrote to the defense that Mr. Thomas was given, pursuant\nto his request, non-case specific information concerning specific federal statutes.” See\nTab 37, February 27, 2008 Email from J.

Again, that claim was utterly false;\nMr. Thomas’s contemporaneous hand-written notes, reviewed by Jay Lefkowitz, confirm\nthat the USAO had violated settled Department policy and ethical rules by providing\ncase-specific information about the Department’s legal theories and plea negotiations.\n\nConclusion\n\nWe bring these difficult and delicate matters of misconduct to your attention not to\nrequire any disciplinary action or review by the Office of Professional Responsibility. Although\nwe have been told that some of this misconduct has been self-reported (only after we raised these\ncomplaints in writing), we feel confident that not all the facts were adequately presented. Rather,\nwe believe that they are highly relevant to your decision whether to authorize a federal\nprosecution in this case. This pattern of overzealous prosecutorial activity strongly suggests\nimproper motives in targeting Jeffrey Epstein, not because of his actions (which are more\nappropriately the subject of state prosecution), but, rather, because of who he is and who he\nknows. We also bring this pervasive pattern of misconduct to your attention because we believe\nit taints any ongoing federal prosecution. The misconduct pervades the evidence in this case.\nThe offers of financial inducement to witnesses, improperly encouraged by the government,\nmake their potential testimony suspect.

It should be to produce good\nlawyers for Americans...\n\nJustice Douglas’ dissenting views quickly became the standard approach of old fashioned liberals\ncommitted to Martin Luther King’s dream of a color blind America where every student was\njudged “not by the color of their skin” but rather by their individual achievements in light of the\nbarriers they have had to overcome.\n\nI became an active advocate for an aggressive affirmative action program at Harvard based on\n\nnon-racial criteria. I participated in numerous campus and faculty meeting debates, and believed\nthat I was on the side of the angels, favoring a system that would produce real diversity without\nviolating the racial equality mandate of the constitution. And I had Justice Douglas on my side!\n\nBut not every liberal accepted Justice Douglas’ race-neutral approach. Many Black leaders saw\nthe issue not as one of individual rights, but rather as one of group aspirations. Blacks had a\ncollective right, under thus view, to “reasonable representation” in the student bodies of\nuniversities and other institutions, both public and private. Some went so far as to argue for\n“proportional representation.” This raised the spectre of “quotas,” which might limit the number\nof those accepted or hired to their proportion of the population.\n\nThe fear of quotas or proportional representation increased as schools throughout the country\nadopted affirmative action programs with many different elements. Some contained “targets” for\nthe number of admitted Blacks. Other had “floors.” Non black students who were denied\nadmissions to schools with such programs began to file lawsuits.\n\nAs these cases made their ways through the courts, a conflict arose between some leaders of the\nAfrican American and Jewish communities. Most African American leaders were deeply\ncommitted to race-specific affirmative action programs that gave advantages to all Black\napplicants, regardless of their individual backgrounds. Most colleges preferred this group\napproach as well, since I was simpler and they preferred to admit wealthy, well educated, and\nprivileged Black candidates over poorer, less well educated and more “difficult” inner-city Blacks.\nDerek Bok, first the Dean of Harvard Law School and then the president of Harvard University,\ncandidly acknowledged that it was far easier to integrate African American graduates of Groten,\nFieldston, and St. Paul’s into Harvard than it would be to integrate inner city public school\ngraduates. (GET BOK QUOTE)\n\nMany Jewish leaders were worried that the hard-earned access of Jews to elite schools would be\nendangered by what they regarded as “racial quotas”. They recalled, with bitterness, the “quotas”\nthat had limited Jewish applicants to single digit “Jewish places” in college and university\nadmissions. There is, of course, a difference between “floor quotas” and “ceiling quotas”. Blacks\nwere seeking a floor on the number of affirmative action admittees: no less than 10 or 15 percent.\n\n293\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_017380\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

If it just looked\nlike a random jumble of notes it would be unconvincing, but luckily there\nare many forms of music that look exactly like a word substitution puzzle.\nBach's Art of Fugue, the canons of Tudor composers such as William Byrd\nand Thomas Tallis, and the works of Grieg all use sequences of chords\nthat move from one to the next using substitution rules. If you were to\nlisten to the steps in our word substitution music, they would definitely\nsound musical. I think they should pass the main artistic criticism — that\nthey should not sound formulaic.\n\nBut is any actual human composition non-computable?\nUnfortunately, we cannot prove whether a particular piece of Bach, Tallis\nor Grieg is non-computable because we don't know the specific rules\nused to compose it.

Beliefs, ideologies, norms, laws, and customs, by\nregulating the behavior of the humans who share them, can shape a society and power the\ncourse of historical events as surely as the phenomena of physics affect the structure and\nevolution of the solar system. To say that ideas—and not just weather, resources,\ngeography, or weaponry—can shape history is not woolly mysticism. It is a statement of\nthe causal powers of information instantiated in human brains and exchanged in networks\nof communication and feedback. Deterministic theories of history, whether they identify\nthe causal engine as technological, climatological, or geographic, are belied by the causal\npower of ideas. The effects of these ideas can include unpredictable lurches and\noscillations that arise from positive feedback or from miscalibrated negative feedback.\n\nAn analysis of society in terms of its propagation of ideas also gave Wiener a\nguideline for social criticism. A healthy society—one that gives its members the means\nto pursue life in defiance of entropy—allows information sensed and contributed by its\nmembers to feed back and affect how the society is governed. A dysfunctional society\ninvokes dogma and authority to impose control from the top down. Wiener thus\ndescribed himself as “a participant in a liberal outlook,” and devoted most of the moral\nand rhetorical energy in the book (both the 1950 and 1954 editions) to denouncing\ncommunism, fascism, McCarthyism, militarism, and authoritarian religion (particularly\nCatholicism and Islam) and to warning that political and scientific institutions were\nbecoming too hierarchical and insular.\n\nWiener’s book is also, here and there, an early exemplar of an increasingly\npopular genre, tech prophecy. Prophecy not in the sense of mere prognostications but in\nthe Old Testament sense of dark warnings of catastrophic payback for the decadence of\none’s contemporaries. Wiener warned against the accelerating nuclear arms race, against\ntechnological change that was imposed without regard to human welfare (“[W]e must\nknow as scientists what man’s nature is and what his built-in purposes are”), and against\nwhat today is called the value-alignment problem: that “the machine like the djinnee,\nwhich can learn and can make decisions on the basis of its learning, will in no way be\nobliged to make such decisions as we should have made, or will be acceptable to us.” In\nthe darker, 1950 edition, he warned of a “threatening new Fascism dependent on the\nmachine a gouverner.”\n\nWiener’s tech prophecy harks back to the Romantic movement’s rebellion against\nthe “dark Satanic mills” of the Industrial Revolution, and perhaps even earlier, to the\narchetypes of Prometheus, Pandora, and Faust. And today it has gone into high gear.\nJeremiahs, many of them (like Wiener) from the worlds of science and technology, have\nsounded alarms about nanotechnology, genetic engineering, Big Data, and particularly\nartificial intelligence. Several contributors to this volume characterize Wiener’s book as\na prescient example of tech prophecy and amplify his dire worries.\n\nYet the two moral themes of The Human Use of Human Beings—the liberal\ndefense of an open society and the dystopian dread of runaway technology—are in\ntension. A society with channels of feedback that maximize human flourishing will have\nmechanisms in place, and can adapt them to changing circumstances, in a way that can\ndomesticate technology to human purposes. There’s nothing idealistic or mystical about\nthis; as Wiener emphasized, ideas, norms, and institutions are themselves a form of\ntechnology, consisting of patterns of information distributed across brains.

He later became the cofounder of a website that provides customized itineraries to\nwould-be vagabonds. His executive status didn’t lessen his mobile addiction. He was as comfortable\ncutting deals from the over-water bungalows of Bora-Bora as he was in the log cabins of the Swiss Alps.\n\nHe once took a call from a client while at Camp Muir on Mt. Rainier. The client needed to confirm\nsome sales numbers and asked Josh about all the wind in the background.

It was Rebekah\nMercer—who had bonded with Bannon, and whose politics were grim, unyielding, and\ndoctrinaire—who defined the family. “She’s ... like whoa, ideologically there is no\nconversation with her,” said one senior Trump White House staffer.\n\nWith the death of Andrew Breitbart in 2012, Bannon, in essence holding the proxy of\nthe Mercers’ investment in the site, took over the Breitbart business. He leveraged his\ngaming experience into using Gamergate—a precursor alt-right movement that coalesced\naround an antipathy toward, and harassment of, women working in the online gaming\nindustry—to build vast amounts of traffic through the virality of political memes. (After\nhours one night in the White House, Bannon would argue that he knew exactly how to\nbuild a Breitbart for the left.

He took full responsibility for the theft of classified documents, saying that he\nhad acted alone. He said that he had been forced to take these documents to expose a crime that\nthreatened the freedom of Americans: the US government’s illegal surveillance of US citizens.\nHe said that he had a duty to bring this secret activity to the attention of the American people.\n“Sitting on his unmade bed—white sheets and covers, white headboard, white bathrobe, white\nskin—Snowden seems like a figure in some obscure ritual, being readied for sacrifice,” George\nPacker wrote about the film in a widely-read article in The New Yorker. He said repeatedly he\nwas willing to make the ultimate sacrifice, by allowing himself to go to prison, so that Americans\ncould live in freedom. A large part of the public, who viewed this powerful film, including many\nof my colleagues in journalism whose writing I greatly respect, came to accept Snowden’s whistle-\nblowing narrative.\n\nThis powerful narrative, as lucidly articulated by Poitras, Greenwald and other Snowden\nsupporters, described the NSA activities exposed by Snowden as part of a vast criminal\nconspiracy involving, among others, President Obama, James Clapper, the Director of National\nIntelligence and both Democrat and Republican members of the Congressional oversight\ncommittees. It further derided claims that there was evidence that Snowden’s theft of NSA\nsecrets went beyond exposing government misdeeds as part of an orchestrated effort to demonize\nSnowden. The purpose of this demonization was to divert away from the government’s crimes.\nFor example, this narrative asserted as if it was established fact, that US government officials had\ndeliberately “trapped” Snowden in Russia. According to Snowden, the purpose of this\ngovernment ploy was to “demonize” him.\n\nTo be sure, it is not unprecedented for the government to release defamatory information\nabout individuals who have embarrassed US intelligence by defecting. When two NSA analysts,\nWilliam Martin and Bernon Mitchell, defected to Russia in the 1960s and accused the NSA of\nviolating international law after arriving in Moscow, U.S. government officials responded by\nputting out the story that they were homosexual lovers, which was both untrue and irrelevant to\nthe intelligence secrets that they compromised. So it is certainly possible that the government put\nout information to intentionally defame Snowden. Secretary of State John Kerry, after all,\ncharacterized him as a coward who should “man up” by returning to the United States.\n\nWhile one can discount such characterizations against him by government officials as\ndemonization, as I do, one cannot as easily dismiss the independent evidence that undermines\nSnowden assertion that his sole motive was blowing the whistle on illicit surveillance in the\nUnited States. For example, by the Lawfare Institute in cooperation with The Brookings\nInstitution in 2014 did an independent analysis of all the published documents that Snowden\nprovided to the media. It concluded that, with some notable exceptions, such as the two\ndocuments initially published by the Guardian and Washington Post, the now famous FISA\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_020171\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

That form which\nwe have substituted, restores the free right to the unbound exercise of reason and freedom\nof opinion. All eyes are opened, or opening, to the rights of man. The general spread of\nthe light of science has already laid open to every view the palpable truth, that the mass of\nmankind has not been born with saddles on their backs, nor a favored few booted and\nspurred, ready to ride them legitimacy, by the grace of God.\n\nJefferson, who himself believed in the God of Deism—that is a non-Biblical, not Judeo Christian\ndiety—saw the Declaration as freeing Americans (and hopefully the rest of the world) from the\nstifling influence of the church (“monkish ignorance and superstition”) and encouraging “the free\nright to the unbound exercise of reason and freedom of opinion.”\n\nEven earlier, Jefferson, while President, had written to the Danbury Baptist Association,\ndescribing that the “act of the whole American people which declared their legislature should\n‘make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof, [as]\nthus building a wall of separation between church and state.”\n\nEven earlier, while Adams was president and Jefferson Secretary of State, they jointly signed a\ntreaty, ratified by the Senate, with the Barbary regime in Tripoli, that stated unequivocally that\n“the government of the United States is not in any sense founded on the Christian religion.”\n(emphasis added).\n\nIt is difficult, therefore, for any reasonable person, especially anyone who gives weight to the\noriginal understanding, to dispute Jefferson’s conclusion that the First Amendment built a wall of\nseparation between church and state and that our state is not based on the Christian religion.\n\nDespite this wall of separation guaranteed by our Constitution and despite the unambiguous\nstatement in the early American treaty, approved by two of our most influential founding fathers,\nthere are those who continue to insist that the United States is a Christian nation, as a matter of\nlaw. I became personally involved in this divisive controversy in 1988, when the Republican Party\nof Arizona proposed the enactment of a resolution declaring the United States to be “a Christian\nnation...based on the absolutes of the Bible.”\n\nThe leader of the group (characterized by the late Arizona Senator Barry Goldwater as a “bunch\nof kooks”) wrote to Justice Sandra Day O’Connor on the United States Supreme Court asking\nher to support their efforts.\n\n“Republicans are making some interesting advances in this heavily controlled Democratic\narea.

Although productivity did indeed\nincrease, the system—possibly inherent in a market economy—did not result in humans\nworking much shorter hours. Rather, what happened is what the anthropologist and\nanarchist David Graeber describes as the growth of “bullshit jobs.”°4 While jobs that\nproduce essentials like food, shelter, and goods have been largely automated away, we\nhave seen an enormous expansion of sectors like corporate law, academic and health\nadministration (as opposed to actual teaching, research, and the practice of medicine),\n“human resources,” and public relations, not to mention new industries like financial\nservices and telemarketing and ancillary industries in the so-called gig economy which\nserve those who are too busy doing all that additional work.\n\nHow will societies cope with technology’s increasingly rapid destruction of entire\nprofessions and throwing large numbers of people out of work? Some argue that this\nconcern is based on a false premise, because new jobs spring up that didn’t exist before,\nbut as Graeber points out, these new jobs won’t necessarily be rewarding or fulfilling.\nDuring the first industrial revolution, it took almost a century before most people were\nbetter off. That revolution was possible only because the government of the time\nruthlessly favored property rights over labor, and most people (and all women) did not\nhave the vote. In today’s democratic societies, it is not clear that the population will\ntolerate such a dramatic upheaval of society based on the promise that “eventually”\nthings will get better.\n\nEven that rosy vision will depend on a radical shake-up of education and lifelong\nlearning. The Industrial Revolution did trigger enormous social change of this kind,\nincluding a shift to universal education. But it will not happen unless we make it happen:\nThis is essentially about power, agency, and control. What’s next for, say, the forty-year-\nold taxi driver or truck driver in an era of autonomous vehicles?\n\nOne idea that has been touted is that of a universal basic income, which will allow\ncitizens to pursue their interests, retrain for new occupations, and generally be free to live\na decent life. However, market economies, which are predicated on growing consumer\ndemand over all else, may not tolerate this innovation. There is also a feeling among\nmany that meaningful work is essential to human dignity and fulfillment. So another\npossibility is that the enormous wealth generated by increased productivity due to\nautomation could be redistributed to jobs requiring human labor and creativity in fields\nsuch as the arts, music, social work, and other worthwhile pursuits. Ultimately, which\njobs are rewarding or productive and which are “bullshit” is a matter of judgment and\nmay vary from society to society, as well as over time.\n\nSo far, ’ve focused on AI’s practical consequences. As a scientist, what bothers me is\nour potential loss of understanding. We are now accumulating data at an incredible rate.\nIn my own lab, an experiment generates over a terabyte of data a day. These data are\nmassaged, analyzed, and reduced until there is an interpretable result. But in all of this\ndata analysis, we believe we know what’s happening.

The others are Istanbul and Madrid.\n\nOpposition lawmakers here have demanded that Mr. Abe stay home and declare a state of emergency.\n\n“The nuclear crisis is real and ongoing, yet the government continues to look the other way,” said Yoshiko Kira of the\nopposition Japan Communist Party, which made significant gains in parliamentary elections last month.\n\n“The government should declare a state of emergency right now, and intervene to stop the outflow of contaminated water,”\nMs. Kira said at an anti-nuclear rally outside Mr. Abe’s office in Tokyo.\n\nMr. Abe remains popular, and it is uncertain how large a liability the crisis at the Fukushima plant will become for him.\n\nBut it has become increasingly clear that the latest problems may be too large for the plant’s operator, the Tokyo Electric\nPower Company, or Tepco, to handle.\n\nTepco has built nearly 1,000 tanks at the sprawling complex to store as many as 335,000 tons of contaminated water, the\nproduct of coolant pumped into the reactors to keep their cores from overheating, and groundwater pouring into their\nbreached basements at a rate of 400 tons a day. This week, Tepco said one tank had sprung a huge leak.\n\nOn Friday, Tepco presented an even starker view of the situation, acknowledging that as much as 220,000 tons of that water\nis stored in makeshift steel tanks similar to the one that is leaking. The operator said the 36-foot-tall cylindrical tanks, meant\nas atemporary repository for the growing amount of radiated water at the complex, used vulnerable rubber sealing and that\ntheir ability to withstand radiation was not tested.\n\nThe tanks are susceptible to leaks at the seams and through their concrete base, said Noriyuki Imaizumi, the acting general\nmanager of Tepco’s nuclear power division. Anearby drain can carry any leaked water to the sea, Mr. Imaizumi said, and\nhigh radiation readings along a section suggest that water has already traveled through the drain to the ocean.\n\nThe makeshift tanks also lack water level gauges, making it difficult to detect leaks. Only two workers are assigned to\nchecking nearly 1,000 tanks on two-hour patrols twice a day, Mr. Imaizumi said.\n\nThe Nuclear Regulation Authority, which the Japanese government ordered to more actively advise and monitor Tepco’s\nactivities at the plant, had told the company to begin transferring the water from the makeshift tanks to better-built vessels.\nBut after visiting the plant on Friday, an authority commissioner, Toyoshi Fuketa, said the vast quantities made doing so\nquickly “unrealistic.”\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_028623\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

Unlike traditional mutual funds, ETFs can trade at a discount or premium to the net asset value and are not directly\nredeemable by the fund.\n\nYou should understand the risks associated with leveraged or inverse ETFs, ETNs or commodities futures-linked ETFs before investing. These types of securities may\nexperience greater price movements than traditional ETFs and may not be appropriate for all investors. Most leveraged and inverse ETFs or ETNs seek to deliver\nmultiples of the performance (or the inverse of the performance) of the underlying index or benchmark on a daily basis. Their performance over a longer period of time\ncan vary significantly from the stated daily performance objectives or the underlying benchmark or index due to the effects of compounding. Performance differences may\nbe magnified in a volatile market. Commodities futures-linked ETFs may perform differently than the spot price for the commodity itself, including due to the entering into\nand liquidating of futures or swap contracts on a continuous basis to maintain exposure (i.e., “rolling”) and disparities between near term future prices and long term future\nprices for the underlying commodity. You should not assume that a commodity-futures linked ETF will provide an effective hedge against other risks in your portfolio.\n\n¢ Alternative Investments. Alternative investments may involve a substantial degree of risk, including the risk of total loss of an investor's capital and the use of leverage,\nand therefore may not be appropriate for all investors. Private equity, private real estate, hedge funds and other alternative investments structured as private investment\nfunds are subject to less regulation than other types of pooled vehicles and liquidity may be limited. Investors in private investment funds should review the Offering\nMemorandum, the Subscription Agreement and any other applicable disclosures for risks and potential conflicts of interest. Terms and conditions governing private\ninvestments are contained in the applicable offering documents, which also include information regarding the liquidity of such investments, which may be limited.\n\n¢ Emerging Markets and Growth Markets. |nvesting in the securities of issuers in emerging markets and growth markets involves certain considerations, including:\npolitical and economic conditions, the potential difficulty of repatriating funds or enforcing contractual or other legal rights, and the small size of the securities markets in\nsuch countries coupled with a low volume of trading, resulting in potential lack of liquidity and in price volatility.\n\n¢ Equity Investments. Equity investments are subject to market risk, which means that the value of the securities may go up or down in respect to the prospects of\nindividual companies, particular industry sectors and/or general economic conditions. The securities of small and mid-capitalization companies involve greater risks than\nthose associated with larger, more established companies and may be subject to more abrupt or erratic price movements.\n\n¢ Fixed Income. |nvestments in fixed income securities are subject to the risks associated with debt securities generally, including credit/default, liquidity and interest rate\nrisk. Any guarantee on an investment grade bond of a given country applies only if held to maturity.\n\n* Non-US Securities. Investing in non-US securities involve the risk of loss as a result of more or less non-US government regulation, less public information, less liquidity\nand greater volatility in the countries of domicile of the issuers of the securities and/or the jurisdiction in which these securities are traded. In addition, investors in\nsecurities such as ADRs/GDRs, whose values are influenced by foreign currencies, effectively assume currency risk.\n\n¢ Real Estate. Investments in real estate involve additional risks not typically associated with other asset classes, such as sensitivities to temporary or permanent\nreductions in property values for the geographic region(s) represented. Real estate investments (both through public and private markets) are also subject to changes in\nbroader macroeconomic conditions, such as interest rates.\n\n. Structured Investments. Structured investments are complex, involve risk and are not suitable for all investors. Investors in structured investments assume the credit risk\nof the issuer or guarantor. If the issuer or guarantor defaults, you may lose your entire investment, even if you hold the product to maturity. Structured investments often\nperform differently from the asset(s) they reference. Credit ratings may pertain to the credit rating of the issuer and are not indicative of the market risk associated with the\nstructured investment or the reference asset. Each structured investment is different, and for each investment you should consider 1) the possibility that at expiration you\nmay be forced to own the reference asset at a depressed price; 2) limits on the ability to share in upside appreciation; 3) the potential for increased losses if the reference\nasset declines; and 4) potential inability to sell given the lack of a public trading market. 32\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_025695\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

Mr. Kutun pleaded guilty on May 18, 2007 in a Miami-\nDade County courtroom as part of an agreement with State prosecutors and he received five\nyears probation and a withholding of adjudication with no requirement to register as a sex\noffender—all without a shred of involvement by federal prosecutors, who declined to prosecute\nhim. Indeed, given the wide use of the telephone in today’s society, it gives a rogue prosecutor\ncarte blanche to turn any local crime into a federal offense. Given the federal government’s\ndecision to abstain from prosecuting that case, it is hard to understand how the federal\nprosecutors responsible for this case think that the State’s treatment of Mr. Epstein somehow\nleaves federal interests substantially unvindicated.

The\nnotice also indicated that there is a 6-\nmonth statute of limitations for filing\ncharges with the Board alleging\nviolations and provided Board contact\ninformation. The Board invited\nsuggested additions or deletions to these\nprovisions that would improve the\ncontent of the notice of employee rights.\nId.\n\nThe content of the proposed notice\nreceived more comments than any other\nsingle topic in the proposed rule. But of\nthe thousands of comments that address\nthe content of the notice, the majority\nare either very general, or identical or\nnearly identical form letters or\n“postcard” comments sent in response\nto comment initiatives by various\ninterest groups, including those\nrepresenting employers, unions, and\nemployee rights organizations. Many\ncomments from both individuals and\norganizations offer general support for\nthe content of the proposed notice,\nstating that employee awareness of basic\nlegal rights will promote a fair and just\nworkplace, improve employee morale,\nand foster workforce stability, among\nother benefits.97 More specifically, one\ncomment asserts that the proposed\nnotice ‘‘contains an accurate,\nunderstandable and balanced\npresentation of rights.” 98 The United\nTransportation Union contends that the\n“notice presents an understandable,\nconcise and extremely informative\nrecitation of workers’ rights, without\ngetting bogged down in extraneous\nlanguage, incomprehensible legalese or\ninnumerable caveats and exceptions.”\n\nOther comments were less supportive\nof the content of the proposed notice\nand the notice-posting requirement in\ngeneral. A significant number of\ncomments, including those from many\nindividuals, employers, and employer\nindustry and interest groups, argue that\nthe content of the notice is not balanced,\nand appears to promote unionization\ninstead of employee freedom of\nassociation. In particular, many\ncomments state that Section 7 of the\n\n°7 See comments of the National Immigration Law\nCenter, Service Employees International Union, and\nWeinberg, Roger & Rosenfeld.\n\n°8 Comment of David Fusco, a labor and\nemployment attorney.\n\nNLRA includes the right to refrain from\nunion activity, but claim that this right\nis given little attention in comparison to\nother rights in the proposed notice.\nSeveral comments also argue that the\nproposed notice excludes rights\nassociated with an anti-union position,\nincluding the right to seek\ndecertification of a bargaining\nrepresentative, the right to abstain from\nunion membership in “‘right-to-work”’\nstates, and rights associated with the\nSupreme Court’s decision in\nCommunications Workers v. Beck.°°\nComments also suggest that the notice\nshould include a warning to employees\nthat unionizing will result in a loss of\nthe right to negotiate directly with their\nemployer.1°° Many of these comments\nargue that a neutral government position\non unionization would be more\ninclusive of anti-union rights.1°\n\nA number of comments address the\nissue of complexity, and argue that the\nBoard’s attempt to summarize the law is\nflawed because the Board’s decisional\nlaw is too complex to condense into a\nsingle workplace notice.1°2 Some of the\ncomments addressing this issue note\nthat NLRA law has been developed over\n75 years, and involves interpretations by\nboth the NLRB and the Federal courts,\nsometimes with conflicting results. The\nChamber of Commerce cites the\n““NLRB’s Basic Guide to the National\nLabor Relations Act: General Principles\nof Law Under the Statute and\nProcedures of the National Labor\nRelations Board” (Basic Guide to the\nNLRA) (1997), available at http://\nwww.nirb.gov/publications/brochures,\nto make their point about legal\ncomplexity. In the Foreword to the\nBasic Guide to the NLRA, the Board’s\nGeneral Counsel states that ‘‘[alny effort\nto state basic principles of law ina\nsimple way is a challenging and\nunenviable task. This is especially true\nabout labor law, a relatively complex\nfield of law.”’ The thrust of these\ncomments about legal complexity was\nthat the NLRA is complex, dynamic,\nand nuanced, and any attempt to\nsummarize it in a workplace notice will\nresult in an oversimplification of the\nlaw and lead to confusion,\nmisunderstanding, inconsistencies, and\nsome say, heightened labor-management\nantagonism. Moreover, some comments\nexpress concern that Board member\nturnover could result in changes to the\n\n99 See comments of Pilchak, Cohen & Tice,\nAmerican Trucking Association, and Electrical and\nMechanical Systems Inc.\n\n100 See, e.g. comment of the Heritage Foundation.\n\n101 See, e.g., comment of the National Right to\nWork Committee.\n\n102 See, e.g., comment of COLLE, Retail Industry\nLeaders Association.\n\nlaw, which may require frequent\nupdates to the notice.1%\n\nMany comments suggest that the\nrequired notice should include only the\nspecific rights contained in Section 7 of\nthe NLRA or, at most, the rights and\nobligations stated in employee\naclvisories on the NLRB’s Web site. The\ncomments favoring a more general\nnotice suggest that the detailed list of\nrights far exceeds the “‘short and plain”\ndescription of rights that the Board has\nfound sufficient to “clearly and\neffectively inform employees of their\nrights under the Act’’ in unfair labor\npractice cases.1°4 See Ishikawa Gasket\nAmerica, Inc., 337 NLRB 175 (2001),\nenfd. 354 F.3d 534 (6th Cir. 2004). A\ncomment from Fisher & Phillips LLP\nargues that, under the Board’s current\nremedial practices, only an employer\nthat egregiously violates the Act on\nnumerous occasions is required to post\nsuch an inclusive list of rights.\n\nFinally, a number of comments\nsuggest that the notice should include a\nlist of employer rights, namely the right\nto distribute anti-union literature and\nthe right to discuss the company’s\nposition regarding unions.\n\nIn addition to the general comments\nabout the proposed notice, many\ncomments offer suggestions for specific\nrevisions to individual provisions\nwithin the five sections of the proposed\nnotice: the introduction, the statement\nof affirmative rights, the examples of\nunlawful conduct, the collective-\nbargaining provision, and the coverage\ninformation. The following discussion\npresents the comments related to\nindividual provisions of the notice,\nfollowed by the Board’s decisions\nregarding the content of the final notice\nmade in response to those comments.\n\na. Comments Regarding the Introduction\n\nThe introduction to the notice of\nrights in the proposed rule stated:\n\nThe National Labor Relations Act (NLRA)\nguarantees the right of employees to organize\nand bargain collectively with their\nemployers, and to engage in other protected\nconcerted activity. Employees covered by the\nNLRB are protected from certain types of\nemployer and union misconduct.

The allegations are completely gratuitous, as\nthere is no such link. No such claim existed until fabricated by Jane Doe #3 many years after the\nNPA was signed and fully performed. Additionally, as stated in Prof. Dershowitz’s Supplement\nto his Motion for Limited Intervention, this “co-conspirator” provision “was intended to apply to\nfour alleged co-conspirators, who were named in the original NPA and later redacted at their\nrequest.... Alan Dershowitz was never alleged to be a potential co-conspirator.” (DE 285 at 4°.)\n\nIncredibly, Jane Doe #3’s counsel, Bradley Edwards, agreed with this reading of the NPA\nin his Statement of Undisputed Fact during his own personal lawsuit against Jeffrey Epstein\n(Jeffrey Epstein v. Scott Rothstein and Bradley J. Edwards, lawsuit (Case no. 502009-CA-\n040800)) in Palm Beach County Circuit Court. There, Edwards explained that these co-\nconspirators were certain individuals who “procured minor females to be molested by Epstein.”\n(DE 291-15 at § 27.) Only now, when convenient as a way to try to justify allegations against\nProf. Dershowitz does Edwards argue (on behalf of Jane Doe #3) that the “co-conspirator”\n\nprovision was actually intended to protect Prof. Dershowitz.\n\n> Moreover, it is unlikely that anyone who had sexual contact with Jane Doe #3, or any other\nminor involved in the Epstein case, would be considered to be a “co-conspirator.” Instead those\nindividuals would be substantive perpetrators, not covered by the agreement.\n\n8\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_010742\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

But Thiel, who gave a speech supporting Trump at the\nRepublican Convention in Cleveland, reported back that, even having been forewarned, he\nabsolutely was certain of Trump’s sincerity when he said they’d be friends for life—only\nnever to basically hear from him again or have his calls returned. Still, power provides its\nown excuses for social lapses. Other aspects of the Trump character were more\nproblematic.\n\nAlmost all the professionals who were now set to join him were coming face to face\nwith the fact that it appeared he knew nothing. There was simply no subject, other than\nperhaps building construction, that he had substantially mastered. Everything with him\nwas off the cuff. Whatever he knew he seemed to have learned an hour before—and that\nwas mostly half-baked. But each member of the new Trump team was convincing him- or\nherself otherwise—because what did they know, the man had been elected president. He\noffered something, obviously. Indeed, while everybody in his rich-guy social circle knew\nabout his wide-ranging ignorance—Trump, the businessman, could not even read a\nbalance sheet, and Trump, who had campaigned on his deal-making skills, was, with his\ninattention to details, a terrible negotiator—they yet found him somehow instinctive. That\nwas the word. He was a force of personality. He could make you believe.\n\n“Is Trump a good person, an intelligent person, a capable person?” asked Sam\nNunberg, Trump’s longtime political aide. “I don’t even know. But I know he’s a star.”\n\nTrying to explain Trump’s virtues and his attraction, Piers Morgan—the British\nnewspaper man and ill-fated CNN anchor who had appeared on Celebrity Apprentice and\nstayed a loyal Trump friend—said it was all in Trump’s book The Art of the Deal.\nEverything that made him Trump and that defined his savvy, energy, and charisma was\nthere. If you wanted to know Trump, just read the book. But Trump had not written 7he\nArt of the Deal. His co-writer, Tony Schwartz, insisted that he had hardly contributed to it\nand might not even have read all of it. And that was perhaps the point. Trump was not a\nwriter, he was a character—a protagonist and hero.\n\nA pro wrestling fan who became a World Wrestling Entertainment supporter and\npersonality (inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame), Trump lived, like Hulk Hogan, as a\nreal-life fictional character. To the amusement of his friends, and unease of many of the\npeople now preparing to work for him at the highest levels of the federal government,\nTrump often spoke of himself in the third person. Trump did this. The Trumpster did that.\nSo powerful was this persona, or role, that he seemed reluctant, or unable, to give it up in\nfavor of being president—or presidential.\n\nHowever difficult he was, many of those now around him tried to justify his behavior\n—tried to find an explanation for his success in it, to understand it as an advantage, not a\nlimitation. For Steve Bannon, Trump’s unique political virtue was as an alpha male,\nmaybe the last of the alpha males. A 1950s man, a Rat Pack type, a character out of Mad\nMen.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_019900\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

Its\njob is to intercept, decode and analyze foreign electronic communications transmitted around the\nglobe over from copper wires, fiber optic cable, satellite, microwave relays, cell phone towers,\nwireless transmissions and the Internet for intelligence purposes. In intelligence jargon, its product\nis called COMINT. This form of intelligence-gathering is particularly effective when the NSA’s\ntargets are unaware of the state-of-the-art tools the NSA uses to break into their computers and\ntelecommunications and decipher their enciphered messages.\n\nIn the first week of June in 2013, the NSA learned that a huge number of its most secret files\nhad been stolen. The suspect was Edward Snowden, a 29 year old civilian analyst at the NSA’s\nregional base in Oahu, Hawaii, who had fled to Hong Kong. The stolen documents revealed,\namong other things, the secret tools and capabilities that the NSA employed to do its job.\nAccording to a three-count criminal complaint filed by Federal prosecutors in the Eastern District\nof Virginia, Snowden had stolen government documents and violated the Espionage Act by the\nunauthorized and willful communication of national defense information to an unauthorized\nperson.\n\nThis was not a who-dunn-it mystery. On June 9\", 2013, in an extraordinary 12-minute video\nmade in a cramped hotel room in Hong Kong, Snowden identified himself as the person who had\ntaken the NSA documents. Watching the video, the world saw a shy, awkward and sympathetic-\nlooking, man wearing a rumpled shirt, rimless glasses and a computer geek-style haircut,\npassionately speaking out against the NSA’s violations of the law and, in a shaky voice,\nexpressing his willingness to expose them.\n\nSnowden had an innocent, idealistic, principled look about him, and the world was ready to\ncongratulate him for revealing the NSA's illegal collection of data inside the United States. But in\nfact, he stole a great deal more than documents relating to domestic surveillance. He had also\nstolen secret documents from the NSA revealing the sources and methods it employed in its\nmonitoring of foreign adversaries.\n\nWhat made this theft even more extraordinary was that he got away with it. By the time it had\n\nbeen discovered in the first week of June 2013, it was not possible for the FBI, the Grand Jury or\nany other US agency to question him because he had fled the country. He went first to Hong\nKong.

Whose interests are being served and why theirs? Many\neconomists and political scientists have thought about \"optimal institutions.\" And much comparative and\nhistorical work has been done. But there isn't really a good unified theory of how these evolve, what\ncharacteristics are likely to emerge, and in what ways they are or are not optimal.\n\n4) Is there a fundamental theory of human societies that's analogous to Darwin's theory in biology?\n\nCan that framework be as well supported by evidence and as simple as natural selection in biology, that will\nlikewise explain the interesting things humans do, like, and believe, and the institutions we construct?\nEvolutionary psychologists think this doesn't require a new theory, just an investigation of the mind that\nbiologically evolved on the Savannah. Others like Dawkins have suggested that we are best understood as\nmachines infested by viruses of the mind which themselves evolve to take advantage of our evolved\npsychology. Anthropologists treat culture as just random inputs. Social psychologists document the funny\nquirks of our behavior without explaining where they come from. And economists assume people optimize\ngiven their tastes and beliefs but take those as given. Is one of these the right theory, if not is there a more\ncompelling theory out there? What will it look like? How will we find it? How will we know we have found it,\nwhen we have?\n\n5) How can we fix the perverse incentives in academia?\n\nResearchers get hired and promoted for publishing in top journals. Journal publication is determined by editors\nand referees. The best way to publish is to make sure your allies are the referees, cite their work, and don't step\non their toes, and to convince the editor you are famous enough and your work is flashy enough that it will be\nwell cited and get covered by the nytimes. None of this requires much attention be paid to truth, insight, or\noriginally.\n\nArguably, this is why the social sciences are such a mess. Few bother to incorporate evidence or arguments\nfrom outsiders (e.g., social psychologists don’t consult historians, economists barely consult social\npsychologists). Few bother to question the fundamental assumptions driving their field that make no sense and\ngo unchecked (e.g., anthropologists treat culture as random inputs). And many researchers end up spending\ntheir whole careers developing and propagating theories that are completely uninteresting to outsiders, or\nobviously fallacious to anyone not steeped in their literature.\n\nIt is ridiculous that we’re still using a system derived from the Society of Letters of the 1500s. Perhaps it's time\nfor something more like Wikipedia, where information gets aggregated and contributors are incentivizes by\ntheir reputation as competent editors to integrate information from across disciplines? Or something like\nReddit, where quality research is recognized by upvotes that aggregate the opinion of thousands from diverse\nfields? Or a certification system of sorts, where papers are certified as having done their statistics right or\nhaving integrated what's known from certain fields, or not citing irrelevant papers for political reasons?\nWhatever the solution is, social scientists and engineers who work on this problem will have orders of\nmagnitude more impact on science than scientists doing primary research in our archaic system.\n\nplease note\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_029267\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

Gissel Packing Co.,\n395 U.S. 575, 617 (1969)). Thus, if a\nFirst Amendment challenge to the rule\nmust fail, so too must a challenge based\non Section 8(c). Such was the holding\nof the D.C. Circuit in UAW v. Chao.\nThere, the court was presented with a\npreemption argument, grounded in\nSection 8(c), challenging a Federal\nprocurement regulation that required\ncontractors to post a notice informing\ntheir employees of certain NLRA rights.\nThe D.C. Circuit interpreted Section 8(c)\nas coextensive with the scope of free\nspeech rights protected by the First\nAmendment and upheld the\nprocurement regulation in light of well-\nestablished free speech jurisprudence in\nthe labor context. See 325 F.3d at 365.\n\n3. Lack of Contemporaneity With the\nEnactment of the NLRA\n\nSeveral comments attack the notice-\nposting regulation for its lack of\ncontemporaneity with the enactment of\nthe NLRA. For example, many\ncomments criticize the regulation by\nnoting that ‘‘this is a new rule\ninterpreted into the Act 75 years after its\npassage.”’ The Board rejects these\ncontentions for two reasons.\n\nFirst, the Supreme Court has\nrepeatedly “‘instructed that ‘neither\nantiquity nor contemporaneity with [a]\nstatute is a condition of [a regulation’s]\nvalidity.”’ Mayo, 131 S. Ct. at 712\n(alterations in original) (quoting Smiley\nv. Citibank (S.D.), N.A., 517 U.S. 735,\n740 (1996)); see also Smiley, 517 U.S. at\n740 (deferring to a regulation “issued\nmore than 100 years after the\nenactment” of the statutory provision\nthat the regulation construed). Second,\nthe argument fails to consider that much\nhas changed since 1935, the year the\nNLRA was enacted. Unionization rates\nare one example. As pointed out in the\nNPRM and as confirmed by comments\nsubmitted by the Association of\nCorporate Counsel’s Employment and\nLabor Law Committee, unionization\nrates increased during the early years of\nthe Act, peaking at around 35 percent of\nthe workforce in the mid-1950s. But\nsince then, the share of the workforce\nrepresented by labor unions has\n\nPilchak attorneys to revise the rule to specify that\nemployers ‘‘may post a notice of equal dignity\nwhich advises employees of * * * additional rights\nand realities.” Alternatively, the Pilchak attorneys\npropose that the Board amend the rule to permit\nemployers to “alter the Poster and include\nadditional rights.” Adopting this suggestion would\ncompromise the integrity of the notice as a\ncommunication from the government. It, too, is\ntherefore rejected.\n\nplummeted to approximately 8 percent.\nAs a result, fewer employees today have\ndirect, everyday access to an important\nsource of information regarding NLRA\nrights and the Board’s ability to enforce\nthose rights.\n\nAs noted above, “[tlhe responsibility\nto adapt the Act to changing patterns of\nindustrial life is entrusted to the Board.”’\nJ. Weingarten, Inc., 420 U.S. at 266. It\nwould therefore be an abdication of that\nresponsibility for the Board to decline to\nadopt this rule simply because of its\nrecent vintage. Accordingly, the Board\nfinds such arguments unpersuasive.\n\n4, Comparison With Other Statutes That\nContain Notice-Posting Requirements\n\nMany comments note, as the Board\ndid in the NPRM, that several other\nlabor and employment statutes enacted\nby Congress contain express notice-\nposting provisions. See 75 FR 80411\n(listing such statutes). Though a few\nsuch comments, such as those of the\nInternational Brotherhood of Teamsters,\napplaud the Board for “‘fill[ing] this\nglaring and indefensible gap,” the bulk\nof these comments instead argue that\nthe lack of a parallel statutory provision\nin the NLRA negates the existence of\nBoard authority to issue this rule.\n\nThe Board notes that inferences\ngleaned from side-by-side comparisons\nto other statutes have diminished force\nwhen an agency uses its gap-filling\nauthority under Chevron. There are\nmany possible reasons why Congress\ndid not include an express notice-\nposting provision in the NLRA.\n“Perhaps that body consciously desired\nthe [agency] to strike the balance at this\nlevel * * *; perhaps it simply did not\nconsider the question at this level; and\nperhaps Congress was unable to forge a\ncoalition on either side of the question\n* * * ” Chevron, 467 U.S. at 865. But,\n“(flor judicial purposes, it matters not\nwhich of these things occurred.” Id.\nIndeed, the central premise behind\nChevron and its progeny is that agencies\nshould be allowed reasonable latitude to\nfill gaps arising from congressional\nsilence or ambiguity. Accordingly, “the\ncontrast between Congress’s mandate in\none context with its silence in another\nsuggests not a prohibition but simply a\ndecision not to mandate any solution in\nthe second context, i.e., to leave the\nquestion to agency discretion.’’ Cheney\nR.R. Co. v. ICC, 902 F.2d 66, 69 (D.C.\nCir. 1990) (labeling the expressio unius\nest exclusio alterius canon “an\nespecially feeble helper’ in Chevron\ncases).\n\nArguments contrasting the NLRA with\nother federal enactments that contain\nnotice-posting requirements might have\nsome persuasive force if there were\n\nevidence that Congress had considered\nand rejected inserting such a\nrequirement into the Act. However,\nnothing in the legislative history of the\nAct so indicates. Indeed, there is not the\nslightest hint that the omission of a\nnotice-posting requirement was the\nproduct of legislative compromise and\ntherefore implies congressional rejection\nof the idea. Cf. Ind. Prot. & Advocacy\nServs. v. Ind. Family & Soc. Servs.\nAdmin., 603 F.3d 365, 384-85 (7th Cir.\n2010) (en banc) (Posner, J., concurring)\n(inferring a private right of action from\nstatutory silence in a case where such\nsilence was not the product of\n“legislative compromise’’). For these\nreasons, the Board rejects the Motor and\nEquipment Manufacturers Association’s\nunsupported suggestion that there has\nbeen an affirmative “legislative\ndetermination not to include a posting\nrequirement by employers that have not\nviolated the Act.”\n\nA number of comments point out that\nCongress included a general notice-\nposting provision in the Railway Labor\nAct (RLA), which predates the NLRA.\nGiven the relative proximity of these\ntwo enactments, some comments regard\nthe absence of a notice-posting\nprovision in the NLRA as strong\nevidence that Congress did not intend\nfor there to be one. For reasons just\nexplained, the Board does not find a\nside-by-side comparison with the RLA\navailing. In addition, the Board notes\nthat although the NLRA and the RLA\nshare several common features, the\nNLRA was not perfectly modeled after\nthe RLA. See Bhd. of R.R. Trainmen v.\nChi. River & Ind. R.R. Co., 353 U.S. 30,\n31 n.2 (1957) (“The relationship of labor\nand management in the railroad\nindustry has developed on a pattern\ndifferent from other industries. The\nfundamental premises and principles of\nthe Railway Labor Act are not the same\nas those which form the basis of the\nNational Labor Relations Act * * *.”’).\n\nFinally, the Board notes that other\nfederal departments and agencies have\nnot understood Congress’s failure to\ninclude an express provision containing\na notice-posting requirement in a federal\nlabor or employment statute as a bar to\nsuch a regulatory requirement. Like the\nNLRA, the Fair Labor Standards Act\n(FLSA), which was passed in 1938, does\nnot contain a provision requiring\nemployers to post a notice of pertinent\nemployee rights. Yet the Department of\nLabor adopted a notice requirement now\ncodified at 29 CFR 516.4. Furthermore,\nthe Board is unaware of any challenge\nto the Labor Department’s authority to\npromulgate or enforce the FLSA notice\nrequirement, which has been in effect\nfor over 60 years. See 14 FR 7516 (Dec.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_022284\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

Those to his political right had the strength but not the will to\ntake a calculated risk for peace. Those to his political left had the will but not the strength, He alone, at the\ntime, had the capacity to persuade the divided and wary Israelis to accept a compromise arrangement with\nthe Palestine Liberation Organization that held great promise for peace but also great risk. But the risk was\nseen as a risk from the Arabs, not the risk of Jew killing Jew, What the right-wing fanatics were blind to is\nthat their murderous intransigence threatened the state that gave them succor and its necessary\nacceptance by the world. Without the flame of peace, they would have nothing but bloodshed threatening\nevery Israeli's personal security.\n\n[ZUCKERMAN: The Palestinians’ Lies Are Fueling the Violence]\n\nThe debate over security in Israel is different from the quarrel with the extremists. Many moderate people\nall across Israel are concerned about giving up land, because for years their leaders told them this land\nwas essential to their national security. In Israel, security decisions are made in the context of the terrible\nreality that a single Israeli strategic blunder may mean not only military defeat but a genocidal threat to the\nvery existence of the state — one that the world could nat forestall, even if it were willing to. Many Israelis\nask: Will the peace process be the beginning of a new future or the beginning of the end?\n\nThe Israelis are determined to avoid another genocide, this time in Israel. The decision to exchange lawfully\ncaptured territory for the promise of peace from those who have constantly threatened violence is fraught\nwith unprecedented risk. Israel will not survive in this neighborhood by superior morality in the absence of\nsuperior real strength. Arab moderation is in direct proportion to Israeli strength. If the Arabs could defeat\nIsrael, who could doubt that sooner or later they would try?\n\nCan Shimon Peres, a durable politician less trusted by Israelis, lead the people in pursuit of Rabin's twin\ngoals of peace and security? He is a consummate international diplomat and served with great distinction\nas prime minister a decade ago. His ardent desire for peace may be part of his problem, for many people\nbelieve he is too eager to cut a deal, too dovish and not skeptical enough about security issues, too\nwrapped up in his own ambitions. So his challenge is to relieve the worries of Israelis as well as meet the\nneeds of the Palestinians.\n\nIn this effort, American support is crucial. Rabin said he was elected to take risks for peace. President\nClinton said, “If that is your goal, | will do my best to minimize the risks you must take.\" That is the fire of\nfriendship and support that will enable Israel to fulfill what Rabin so bravely began.\n\n‘Rabin, The Last Day’: Venice Review inform\n\nInform\n\n@\n\nTAGS: Israel, Palestine, Middle East, Judaism\n\n+ More\n\nRankings & Consumer Advice\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_010756\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

Israel today is an amazing beehive of innovation — thanks, in part, to an influx of Russian\nbrainpower, massive U.S. aid and smart policies. It’s something Jews should be proud of. But had Romney gone\nto Ramallah he would have seen a Palestinian beehive of entrepreneurship, too, albeit small, but not bad for a\npeople living under occupation. Palestinian business talent also built the Persian Gulf states. In short, Romney\ndidn’t know what he was talking about.\n\nOn peace, the Palestinians’ diplomacy has been a fractured mess, and I still don’t know if they can be a partner\nfor a secure two-state deal with even the most liberal Israeli government. But I do know this: It is in Israel’s\noverwhelming interest to test, test and have the U.S. keep testing creative ideas for a two-state solution. That is\nwhat a real U.S. friend would promise to do. Otherwise, Israel could be doomed to become a kind of apartheid\nSouth Africa.\n\nAnd here is what I also know: The three U.S. statesmen who have done the most to make Israel more secure and\naccepted in the region all told blunt truths to every Israeli or Arab leader: Jimmy Carter, who helped forge a\nlasting peace between Israel and Egypt; Henry Kissinger, who built the post-1973 war disengagement\nagreements with Syria, Israel and Egypt; and James Baker, who engineered the Madrid peace conference. All of\nthem knew that to make progress in this region you have to get in the face of both sides. They both need the\nexcuse at times that “the Americans made me do it,” because their own politics are too knotted to move on their\nown.\n\nSo how about all you U.S. politicians — Republicans and Democrats — stop feeding off this conflict for\npolitical gain.

Take just one: heat. My body temperature is higher than the air\ntemperature, so I radiate heat, which must be replenished in my core. Even the bacteria\nin my digestive tract use sensors to measure sugar concentrations in the liquid around\nthem and whip their tail-like flagella to swim “upstream” where the sugar supply is\nrichest. The natural state of all systems is to flow to lower energy states, a process that is\nbroadly described by entropy (the tendency of things to go from ordered to disordered\nstates; all things will fall apart eventually, including the universe itself).\n\nBut how do you explain more complex behavior, such as our ability to make\ndecisions? The answer is just more gradient descent.\n\nOur Brains\n\nAs miraculous and inscrutable as our human intelligence is, science is coming around to\nthe view that our brains operate the same way as any other complex system with layers\nand feedback loops, all pursuing what we mathematically call “optimization functions”\nbut you could just as well call “flowing downhill” in some sense.\n\nThe essence of intelligence is learning, and we do that by correlating inputs with\npositive or negatives scores (rewards or punishment). So, for a baby, “this sound” (your\nmother’s voice) is associated with other learned connections to your mother, such as food\nor comfort. Likewise, “this muscle motion brings my thumb closer to my mouth.” Over\ntime and trial and error, the brain’s neural network reinforces those connections.\nMeanwhile “this muscle motion does not bring my thumb close to my mouth” is a\nnegative correlation, and the brain will weaken those connections.\n\nHowever, this is too simplistic. The limits of gradient descent constitute the so-\ncalled local-minima problem (or local-maxima problem, if you’re doing a gradient\nascent). If you are walking in a mountainous region and want to get home, always\nwalking downhill will most likely get you to the next valley but not necessarily over the\nother mountains that lie around it and between you and home. For that, you need either a\nmental model (i.e., a map) of the topology so you know where to ascend to get out of the\nvalley, or you need to switch between gradient descent and random walks so you can\nbounce your way out of the region.\n\nWhich 1s, in fact, exactly what the mosquito does in following my scent: It\ndescends when it’s in my plume and random-walks when it has lost the trail or hit an\nobstacle.\n\nAl\nSo that’s nature. What about computers? Traditional software doesn’t work that way—it\nfollows deterministic trees of hard logic: “If this, do that.” But software that interacts\nwith the physical world tends to work more /ike the physical world. That means dealing\nwith noisy inputs (sensors or human behavior) and providing probabilistic, not\ndeterministic, results. And that, in turn, means more gradient descent.\n\nAI software is the best example of this, especially the kinds of AI that use\nartificial neural-network models (including convolutional, or “deep,” neural networks of\nmany layers). In these, a typical process consists of “training” them by showing them\n\n105\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_016908\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

In some cases,\nauthorities in Beijing seem to have had problems finding appropriately influential\nAmericans to take seats on the committee, such as in 2017, when a Chinese property\ndeveloper and educator (who appears to still be a Chinese citizen) was one of seven\n“Americans” listed as CPPCC members.”\n\nIn doling out prestigious positions on the CPPCC, China seeks to show overseas\n\nChinese that prominent members of their community want to be connected with\n\nChina’s government.

Perhaps the most remarkable in years, the list of thirty-\nfive overseas representatives included four highly successful Chinese American academics,\nscientists, and businessmen.”?\n\nThe appointment of Chinese Americans to positions on this advisory body to the Chinese\nCommunist Party raises difficult questions of divided national loyalty.

The General Assembly simply noted “with\ngreat concern that the armed conflict in Kampuchea [Cambodia] and is seriously threatening the\npeace and stability of South-East Asia.” In contrast, a resolution passed that same year “deplores\nthe continued and persistent violation by Israel of the Geneva Convention relative to the\nProtection of Civilian Persons in Time of War, of 12 August 1949, and other applicable\ninternational instruments, and condemns in particular those violations which that Convention\ndesignates as ‘grave breaches’ thereof.”\n\nTrue to form, Chomsky related Cambodia to Israel, inverting the actual seriousness of the human\nrights violations and asserting that “condemnation of Cambodian atrocities, covering the full\nspectrum with the exception of some Maoist groups, had reached a level and scale that has rarely\nbeen matched, whereas the situation of the Arabs under Israeli occupation (or indeed, in Israel\nitself) is virtually a taboo topic in the United States.”\n\nThe Zionism-racism resolution was ultimately rescinded in 1991 by a vote of the General\nAssembly, but it continued to animate U.N. actions, especially by the “Human Rights Council” of\nthe U.N. (previously known as the UN Commission on Human Rights), which in 2001 convened\nthe first of several “Durban Conferences” against “racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and\nrelated intolerance.” Its primary, if not exclusive, focus was on Israel. It virtually ignored racial\ngenocides, slavery and other obvious manifestations of racism and discrimination. The final\npreparatory session was held in Tehran.

The American partner city was home\nto a large number of national security professionals and university and government\nscientists, including many of PRC origin. The partnership was proposed and\nshepherded by the manager of a for-profit Chinese “exchanges” company—a woman\nof PRC origin. She was assisted by an American citizen of PRC origin who was running\n\nfor a position on the local school board.\n\nIn a briefing, an American China expert told the local sister city committee that there\nwas no reason not to explore a partnership, provided the American side had defined\ngoals and was aware of Beijing’s increasingly repressive domestic policies, its growing\nsuspicions of US influence, and its well-funded efforts to increase its influence overseas.\nThe man running for the local school board objected to this characterization and\n\npointed out that China’s constitution gives the CCP paramount authority in China.\n\nAfter a long debate, the new sister city agreement was signed in the fall of 2018.\n\nSome Americans involved objected to China’s insistence that all sister city activities\nbe carried out “in accordance with the principles on the establishment of diplomatic\nrelations between the United States of America and the People’s Republic of China\n(ARGS A B32 Xe M),” because this seemed to be a reference to the One China\nPrinciple, which might be invoked to preclude exchanges with Taiwan. Despite these\nobjections, the phrase appeared in the signed agreement because the Chinese side said\nthat the Chinese People’s Association for Friendship with Foreign Countries required\nthat all sister city agreements include such language and the US side did not want to\n\nderail the agreement by insisting otherwise.\n\nThe story of this sister city agreement illustrates the challenges and opportunities\n“sub-national entities” (local governments, cities, and states) face in the United States\nwhen dealing with a China intent on maximizing its influence in America and across\nthe globe.

As part of the Sea Around Us Project, a joint\ncollaboration between the university and the Pew Charitable Trusts, she researches marketbased\nconservation initiatives related to seafood and other natural resources. With colleagues\nfrom the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Biology and UBC’s Mathematics Department,\nshe is currently conducting a series of games and experiments to study the effects of honor and\nshame on cooperation.\nFinancial executives received almost $20 billion in bonuses in 2008 amid a serious financial\ncrisis and a $245 billion government bailout. In 2008, more than 3 million American homes went\ninto foreclosure because of mortgage blunders those same executives helped facilitate. Citigroup\nproposed to buy a $50-million corporate jet in early 2009, shortly after receiving $45-billion in\ntaxpayer funds. Days later, President Obama took note in an Oval Office interview. About the\njet, he said, “They should know better.” And the bonuses, he said, were “shameful.”\nWhat is shame’s purpose? Is shame still necessary? These are questions I’m asking\nmyself. After all, it is not just bankers we have to worry about. Most social dilemmas exhibit a\nsimilar tension between individual and group interest. Energy, food, and water shortages, climate\ndisruption, declining fisheries, increasing antibiotic resistance, the threat of nuclear warfare—all\ncan be characterized as tragedies of the commons, in which the choices of individuals conflict\nwith the greater good.\nBalancing group- and self-interest has never been easy, yet human societies display a\nhigh level of cooperation. To attain that level, specialized traits had to evolve, including such\nemotions as shame. 1 Shame is what is supposed to occur after an individual fails to cooperate\n                                                        \n1 R.

Shame regulates social behavior and serves as a forewarning of punishment:\nConform or suffer the consequences. The earliest feelings of shame were likely over issues of\nwaste management, greediness, and incompetence. While guilt is evoked by an individual’s\nstandards, shame is the result of group standards. Therefore, shame, unlike guilt, is felt only in\nthe context of other people.\nThe first hominids could keep track of cooperation and defection only by firsthand\nobservation. Many animals use visual observations to decide whether to work with others. Reef\nfish in the Red Sea, for instance, watch wrasses clean other reef fish, to determine whether or not\nthey’re cooperative, as biologist Redouan Bshary discovered. Bshary went scuba diving off\nEgypt’s coast to observe this symbiotic relationship. Bluestreak cleaner wrasses (Labroides\ndimidiatus) eat parasites, along with dead or infected tissue, off reef fishes in more than 2,000\ninteractions a day, each of which can be considered an act of cooperation. Wrasses are tempted\nto eat more than just the parasites, but if the reef fish loses too much flesh in the deal, it will\nrefuse to continue working with the wrasse. Reef fish approach wrasses that they see cooperating\nwith their current clients and avoid the wrasses they see biting off more than they should chew. 2\nLike the Bluestreak cleaner wrasses, humans are also more cooperative when they sense\nthey are being watched. Researchers at the University of Newcastle upon Tyne examined the\neffect of a pair of eyes on payments for tea and coffee to an honesty box. Alternating images of\nflowers and human faces were posted above the box in the university coffee room each week for\nten weeks; researchers found that people paid nearly three times as much for their drinks in\n                                                        \n2 R. Bshary, “Biting cleaner fish use altruism to deceive image-scoring client reef fish,” Proc.

To try to know what others are doing is a fundamental part of being human. So is fitting\nin. The more collectivist the human society, the more important it is to conform and the more\nprominent the role of shame. 4 Shame serves as a warning to adhere to group standards or be\nprepared for peer punishment. Many individualistic societies, however, have migrated away from\npeer punishment toward a third-party penal system, such as a hired police force, formal\ncontracts, or trial by jury. Shame has become less relevant in societies where taking the law into\none’s own hands is viewed as a breach of civility.\nPerhaps this is why it makes us uncomfortable to contemplate shaming people: Shame\ninvites the public in on the punishment. Consider the scaffolds, scab lists during union strikes, or\nNathaniel Hawthorne’s The Scarlet Letter. Or the proposal made by prominent conservative\nWilliam F. Buckley Jr. in 1986 to tattoo people with AIDS. These instances of shaming now\nseem an affront to individual liberty. Getting rid of shaming seems like a pretty good thing,\nespecially in regulating individual behavior that does not harm others. In eschewing public\nshaming, society has begun to rely more heavily on individual feelings of guilt to enhance\ncooperation.\nGuilt prevails in many social dilemmas, including one area of my own research:\noverfishing. At the root of the problem of overfishing is the human appetite. Wild fish catches\nare declining, and many of us seek to avoid the guilt brought on by eating unsustainable seafood.\n                                                        \n3 M. Bateson, D.

MAKE IT POLLOCK IN GUILT-FREE GUIDE TO SEAFOOD” (The Times of London), and\n“A GOOD APPETITE; SEAFOOD, EASY AND GUILT-FREE” (New York Times).\nIt is perhaps unsurprising that a set of tools has emerged to assuage this guilt and, in the\ncase of seafood, reform the appetite. 5 These tools aim to divert demand from one type of seafood\ntoward another. Wallet cards, iPhone apps, and eco-labels tell consumers which fish ought to be\nand ought not to be eaten. Shoppers in Europe have been given rulers, so that they can measure\nfish and avoid buying juveniles.\nGuilt abounds in many situations where conservation is an issue, not just in the response\nto overfishing. Harried by guilt, one mother reuses her daughter’s bathwater for her own bath.\nLos Angeles shoppers refuse to buy blueberries imported from Chile, because of the fuel\nconsumed in shipping them. Another woman feels guilty about the natural habitat lost to cocoa\ncultivation and refuses to buy chocolate, prompting her husband to say that she took the joy out\nof his Almond Joy. 6\nJust as the devout purchased guilt-alleviating papal indulgences in the\nMiddle Ages, guilt-ridden consumers today buy carbon offsets, LED light bulbs, and hybrid cars\nand can be guided to something approaching sanctimony by books like The Virtuous Consumer,\nThe Rough Guide to Shopping with a Conscience, and The Eco Chick Guide to Life: How to Be\nFabulously Green.\nThe problem is that environmental guilt, while it may well lead to conspicuous\necomarkets, does not seem to elicit conspicuous results. One supermarket chain introduced signs\nat the fish counter to show the most and least sustainable seafood: Sales of the green-tagged\n                                                        \n5 J.

Another drawback is that guilt is triggered by an existing value within an individual.\nIf the value does not exist, there is no guilt and hence no action (e.g., sales for red “worst choice”\nseafood remained the same). What if the aim were to promote a value felt by the group but not\nnecessarily by every individual in the group? Many problems, like most concerning the\nenvironment, are group problems. Perhaps to solve these problems we need a group emotion.\nMaybe we need shame.\nShaming, as noted, is unwelcome in regulating personal conduct that does not harm\nothers. But what about shaming conduct that does harm others? The U.S. National Sex Offender\nRegistry provides an online database with the names, photographs, and addresses of sex\noffenders in every state.

These instances of shaming might\ndeter bad behavior, but critics like Martha Nussbaum, a political philosopher at the University of\nChicago, argue that shaming by the state conflicts with the law’s obligation to protect citizens\nfrom insults to their dignity. 10\nWhat if government is not involved in the shaming? A neighborhood in Leicester,\nEngland, has a YouTube channel dedicated to neighborhood issues, including catching “litter\nlouts.” A collection of videos shows individuals caught in various acts of littering, and if\nsomeone recognizes the litter lout, he or she can e-mail the lout’s identity to the neighborhood\nmanagement board, which they pass on to City Council so that fines can be issued and the video\nremoved. In 2008, the Santa Fe Reporter published the names and addresses of the top ten\nwater-using households in the city (first place went to a homeowner who used twenty-one times\nthe household average). The tennis club near my apartment in Vancouver, B.C. publishes the\nnames of people who do not pay their dues. In each of these cases, the activity of the individual\ncompromises the community. In none of them is the state involved in the shaming. Is this a fair\nuse of shaming? Is it effective?\nLet’s deal with the latter question. Shaming might work to change behavior in these\ncases, but in a world of urgent, large-scale problems, changing individual behavior is\ninsignificant. Small changes, adopted by one individual at a time, can make a difference in a\nproblem only when the problem is small or there is lots of time to solve it (for instance, in\n                                                        \n10 M.

NJ: Princeton University Press,\n2004).\n  6\nForthcoming (August 2011) Future Science edited by Max Brockman, Vintage Press, New York.\nmarginalizing politically incorrect words). Many of today’s social movements, like the\nindustries they seek to revolutionize, must make big changes quickly—which is best\naccomplished by directing efforts upward toward institutions. I call this vertical agitation. The\nSanta Fe Reporter listed the top ten commercial water users, in addition to the top ten\nhouseholds. The first of these offenders, the city of Santa Fe, used 195 times more water than the\nnumber-one household offender. Imagine the relative difference in getting the city to commit to\nwater-saving techniques as compared to reforming a single household.\nGuilt cannot work at the institutional level, since it is evoked by individual scruples,\nwhich vary widely. But shame is not evoked by scruples alone; since it’s a public sentiment, it\nalso affects reputation, which is important to an institution. At the 2004 meeting of the World\nEconomic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, leading CEOs issued a press release about how\ncorporate brand reputation outranked financial performance as the most important measure of\nsuccess. For an example of how shame and reputation interact, consider restaurant hygiene cards,\nintroduced in 1998 by Los Angeles County as a shaming technique in the interests of public\nhealth. Restaurants were required to display grade cards that corresponded to their most recent\ngovernment hygiene inspection. The large grade in the window—A, B, or C—honors restaurants\nthat value cleanliness most and shames those that value it least. The grade cards have apparently\nled to increased customer sensitivity to restaurant hygiene, a 20-percent decrease in county-wide\nhospitalizations for food-borne illnesses, and better hygiene scores for county restaurants. 11\nRecall that in our early evolution we could gauge cooperation only first-hand. As group\nsize got bigger, and ancient humans grappled with issues of necessary cooperation, the human\nbrain became better able to keep track of all the rules and all the people.

Language, both\noral and written, allowed for gossip, a vector for social information. Research carried out by Ralf\nSommerfeld of the Max-Planck Institute for Evolutionary Biology and his colleagues\ndemonstrated that in cooperation games that allowed players to gossip about one another’s\nperformance, positive gossip resulted in higher cooperation. Of even greater interest, gossip\naffected the players’ perceptions of others even when they had access to firsthand information. 13\nHuman society today is so big that its dimensions have outgrown our brains. We have an\nincreasing number of people and norms. What tool could help us gossip in a group this size?\nNowadays we keep track of and distribute unprecedented amounts of information via our\ncomputers: for example, citizens, journalists, and interest groups can access the U.S.\nEnvironmental Protection Agency’s Toxics Release Inventory database online to identify and\nshame polluters. Between the database’s inception in 1988 and 1995, releases of 330 toxic\nchemicals on the list have declined by 45 percent. 14\nAfter the retailer Trader Joe’s was\nunresponsive to requests by the nonprofit group Greenpeace to stop selling unsustainable\nseafood, Greenpeace coordinated singing fish telephone calls or demonstrations at every Trader\nJoe’s across the nation using the Internet. The Trader Joe’s CEO decided to comply with\nGreenpeace demands by dropping several overfished species and agreeing to source all seafood\nfrom sustainable sources by the end of 2012.\nWe can use computers to simulate some of the intimacy of tribal life, but we need\n                                                        \n12 See esp. his Grooming, Gossip and the Evolution of Language (Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 1997).\n13 R.

In addition, the emergence of new tools—\nlanguage, writing, the Internet—cannot completely replace the eyes. Face to face interactions,\nsuch as those outside of Trader Joe’s stores, are still the most impressive form of dissent.\nSo what is stopping shame from catalyzing social change? I see three main drawbacks:\n(1.) Today’s world is rife with ephemeral, or “one-off,” interactions. When you know\nyou are unlikely to run into the same situation again, there is less incentive to change your\nbehavior. Research shows, however, that if people know they will interact again, cooperation\nimproves. 15 Shame works better if the potential for future interaction is high. In a world of oneoff\ninteractions, we can try to compensate for anonymity with an image score, such as the\nhygiene grade cards or EBay’s seller ratings, which sends a signal to the group about an\nindividual or an institution’s degree of cooperation.\n(2.) Today’s world allows for amorphous identities. Recall the reef fish that observe\nBluestreak cleaner wrasses in the Red Sea. The wrasses seem to know they are being watched,\nand certain wrasses will build their reputation on the small reef fish, allowing the big reef fish to\nobserve their cooperative behavior with the small fry. Then, when the big fish comes in for its\nown cleaning, these wrasses eat some of the big reef fish’s flesh along with its parasites,\nfattening themselves on their defection. To add to the confusion on the reef, False cleanerfish\n(Aspidontus taeniatus) make their living by looking very similar to the Bluestreak cleaner\nwrasses. They are able to approach reef fish under the guise of cooperation and then bite off\npieces of fish flesh and swim off.\nMany of our interactions these days are similar to the fish cleanings in the Red Sea. It’s\n                                                        \n15 M. Milinski, D. Semmann, & H. Krambeck, “Reputation helps solve the ‘tragedy of the commons,’ ” Nature 415,\n424-26 (2002).\n  9\nForthcoming (August 2011) Future Science edited by Max Brockman, Vintage Press, New York.\nhard to keep track of who cooperates and who doesn’t, especially if it’s institutions you’re\nmonitoring. Enron, which in 2001 filed one of the largest bankruptcies in U.S. history, hid\nbillions of dollars in debt in hundreds of shell firms, which bought poorly performing Enron\nstocks so that Enron could create a fraudulent company profile and mislead its auditors. Lehman\nBrothers, in the years before its 2008 collapse, used a smaller firm called Hudson Castle (of\nwhich it owned 25 percent) to shift risky investments off its books so that Hudson Castle, not\nLehman Brothers, could absorb “headline risk.” Which leads us to shaming’s third weakness.\n(3.) Shaming’s biggest drawback is its insufficiency. Some people have no shame. In the\nresearch my colleagues and I have conducted on first-year students, involving games that require\ncooperation, we have found that shame does not encourage cooperation among those players\nwho are least cooperative. This suggests that a certain fraction of a given population will always\nbehave shamelessly, like the False cleanerfish, if the payoff is high enough. The banks may have\ngone bankrupt, but the bankers got their bonuses. There was even speculation that publishing\nindividual banker bonuses would lead to banker jealousy, not shame.\nMy colleagues and I conclude that ultimately shame is not enough to catalyze major\nsocial change. Slavery did not end because abolitionists shamed slave owners into freeing their\nslaves. Child labor did not stop because factories were shamed into forbidding children to work.\nDestruction of the ozone layer did not slow because industries were ashamed to manufacture\nproducts that contained chlorofluorocarbons. This is why punishment remains imperative. Even\nif shaming were enough to bring the behavior of most people into line, governments need a\nsystem of punishment to protect the group from the least cooperative players.\nFinally, consider who belongs to the group. Today we are faced with the additional\nchallenge of balancing human interests and the interests of nonhuman life. How can we\n  10\nForthcoming (August 2011) Future Science edited by Max Brockman, Vintage Press, New York.\nencourage cooperation between all living things when the nonhumans have no voice? Successful\nspecies will likely be those that recognize, implicitly or explicitly, life’s interdependency. If\nhumans are to succeed as a species, our collective shame over destroying other life-forms should\ngrow in proportion to our understanding of their various ecological roles. Maybe the same\nattention to one another that promoted our own evolutionary success will keep us from failing\nthe other species in life’s fabric and, in the end, ourselves.\n  11\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

Defense attorney Jack Goldberger claims that his\nclient, Jeffrey Epstein, had no idea that the untrained girls he hired for massages were\nminors.\n\nThe Palm Beach Count State Attorney's Office could have let a jury decide whom to\nbelieve. Instead, State Attorney Barry Krischer left the public to wonder whether the\nsystem tilted in favor of a wealthy, well-connected alleged perpetrator and against very\nyoung girls who are alleged victims of sex crimes.\n\nMr. Krischer took the unusual step of referring the case to a grand jury, which last month\nindicted Jeffrey Epstein on one felony count of solicitation of prostitution. That decision\ncame after Harvard law Professor Alan Dershowitz met with prosecutors to undermine\nthe credibility of the 14- to 17-yearold girls who charged that Mr. Epstein had paid them\n$200 to $300 to undress and massage him in his five-bedroom, 7 1/2 -bath home on the\nIntracoastal Waterway.\n\nThe girls, Mr. Dershowitz told prosecutors, had written on myspace.com about smoking\nmarijuana and drinking alcohol. But if the girls have a credibility problem, what about\nJeffrey Epstein? Mr. Goldberger, told The Post: \"Mr. Epstein absolutely insisted anybody\nwho came to his house be over the age of 18. How he verified that, I don't know.\" And\nprosecutors took him at his word?\n\nPolice collected evidence that refutes Jeffrey Epstein’s defense. Police searched his home\nand garbage and found phone messages about the girls’ school schedules and even a high\nschool transcript, suggesting that Mr. Epstein at least knew that the girls were teenagers.\nThe state attorney's office has responded to criticism from Palm Beach police and others\nby noting the higher standard prosecutors face for conviction than law-enforcement\nofficers do for arrest. But in this case, the state attorney bowed to the risk that a jury\nmight look at both Jeffrey Epstein and the girls, and point fingers at both sides.\n\nEven if the girls could be impugned as prostitutes, solicitation of a minor is a crime.\nFormer disc jockey and teacher Bruno Moore was charged with that Tuesday.\nInvestigators say the 34-year-old used the Internet - myspace.com - to recruit a 13-year\nold.\n\nPolice say Jeffrey Epstein used a 20-year-old woman who had a myspace.com\n\naccount to recruit young girls.

But his plan to avoid it basically \nrepeated the offer of a \"balanced approach\" \n— unspecified tax hikes and spending cuts \n— which Republicans have already \nrejected. \nSomewhat more substantively, he called for \na larger deficit-reduction deal built around \nloophole-closing tax reform and what he \ncalled \"modest\" reforms to Medicare and \nentitlements. In an apparent effort to rally \nDemocrats to this cause, he called on \n\"those of us who care deeply about \nprograms like Medicare\" to \"embrace\" \nreform. \nYet in promising the same amount of \nMedicare savings as the Simpson-Bowles \ncommision proposed, Mr. Obama did not \nmention that this would be a mere $341 \nbillion over 10 years. All told, he envisions \nshaving an additional $1.5 trillion off \nprojected deficits over 10 years, which \nwould leave the national debt at a \nhistorically aberrant 70-odd percent of \ngross domestic product. In short, he \ndeclined to push back against the mind-set \nwithin his party that considers acceptable \n\"stabilizing\" the debt at this level by the \ntime Mr. Obama's second term ends. At \nbest, that would buy a respite of a few \nyears before the debt resumed its upward \nclimb. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 028676 \nAs for raising the economy's growth \npotential, the president was more \npersuasive. His emphasis on reforming the \ntangled and counterproductive corporate \ntax code was especially welcome, and \nrelatively likely to draw GOP support. He \noffered several promising ideas on \neducation, including a promise of \"high-\nquality preschool\" for all children, though \nhow that would square with his promise not \nto increase the deficit by a single dime \nwent unexplained. He sounded a ringing \ncall for greater federal attention to college \ncost containment. \"Taxpayers can't keep on \nsubsidizing\" spiraling tuition, he said, \ncandidly and correctly. \nAs European trading partners had hoped, \nthe president endorsed negotiations for a \ntransatlantic free-trade zone, which would \nhelp America's export industries and the \njobs that depend on them. Coupled with an \nagreement that Obama is promoting for the \nPacific region, the proposal has the \npotential to make his second term fruitful \nfor global trade. He also suggested raising \nthe federal minimum wage, from $7.25 per \nhour to $9 — although the precise amount \nis less important, in our view, than the \npresident's call for annual cost-of-living \nadjustments. \nIn keeping with Mr. Obama's theme of \nnation-building at home, foreign policy \nplayed a secondary role in his speech. He \npromised to bring home half of the \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 028677 \nremaining U.S. troops in Afghanistan \nwithin the next year. But officials said the \nwithdrawal would be weighted toward \nyear's end, leaving most of the troops to \npartner with Afghan troops for much of this \nyear. The president said the United States \nwould support democratic transitions in the \nMiddle East, \"keep the pressure on [the] \nSyrian regime\" and \"do what is necessary \nto prevent\" Iran from obtaining a nuclear \nweapon — but he offered no specifics. \nMr. Obama pressed his case for reform of \nimmigration laws and for action to slow \nglobal warming — and, in especially \nmoving terms, tougher gun laws. In each \ncase, there may be measures he can take \nthrough executive action, but new laws will \nbe needed for substantial progress. \nMr. Obama was right when he pointed to \nthe survivors and grieving relatives of gun \nviolence victims and insisted, \"They \ndeserve a vote.\" \nArticle 2 \nForeign Policy \nThe world is no longer \nAmerica's problem  \nAaron David Miller \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 028678 \nFebruary 13, 2013 -- If you want to know \nwhat an American president's foreign \npolicy is likely to be, particularly in a \nsecond term, don't listen to his State of the \nUnion speech. You'd probably have more \nluck playing with Tarot cards, or reading \ntea leaves or goat entrails. But not this year. \nBarack Obama's fourth such address left a \ntrail of foreign-policy cookie crumbs that \nlead directly to some pretty clear, if hardly \nsurprising or revolutionary, conclusions. \nHis first term contained no spectacular \nsuccesses (save killing Osama bin Laden), \nbut no spectacular failures either. And \nmore than likely, that's what the president \nwill settle for in a second, even as the Arab \nworld burns and rogues like Iran and North \nKorea brandish new weapons. He's nothing \nif not a cautious man. \nBehold: I am the Extricator in Chief \nAfghanistan -- the \"good war\" -- has been \npretty much MIA in Obama's speeches \nsince he became president. He's alternated \nbetween spending a few words on the \nmission there (2009) or a paragraph (2010, \n2011, 2012). If his words have been brief, \nthe message has been stunningly clear: It's \nabout the leaving. And tonight was no \nexception. Not more than two minutes in, \nthe president spoke about America's men \nand women coming home from \nAfghanistan. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 028679 \nObama's signature is indeed that of the \nextricator. And he broke the code early (the \n2009 surge was designed politically to get \nin so that he could get out with a clearer \nconscience). He is the president who has \nwound down the longest and among the \nmost profitless wars in American history, \nwhere victory was never defined by \nwhether we can win, but by when can we \nleave. It is his legacy, and one about which \nhe has reason to be proud. Obama has left \nhimself and his military commanders \nplenty of discretion about the pace of \nextrication. But that's fine with the \npresident so long as they're heading for the \nexits. \nNot the Destroyer and Rebuilder of Worlds \nSurprise, surprise: There was scant mention \nof Syria in the president's speech -- just one \nthrowaway line about supporting Syria's \nopposition. Obama did not disengage from \nIraq and Afghanistan only to plunge \nAmerica into new black holes in the \nMiddle East. \nObama isn't worried about boots on the \nground in Syria. That was never on the \ntable. Instead the question is this: Given the \nuncertainty about the end state in Syria and \nthe risks of providing serious weapons to \nthe rebels (and a no-fly zone) that might \nalter the arc of the fight against the regime, \nthe president saw and continues to see no \npurpose in America providing arms of \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 028680 \nmarginal utility. That course would either \nexpose him to be truly weak and ineffectual \nor lead to calls to do more. So he's going to \nprovide non-lethal support and is \napparently prepared to take the hits from \ncritics who see the president's policy as \npassive, cruel, and unforgiving, particularly \nnow that we know that members of his own \ncabinet clearly wanted to do more. The \nIranian nuclear issue, the other potential tar \nbaby in the SOTU, followed a pretty \npredictable rising arc of concern in the list \nof presidential foreign-policy worries. In \n2009, in Obama's address to a joint session \nof Congress (a speech some regard as a \nSOTU), Iran wasn't even mentioned. In the \n2010 SOTU, Obama threatened that if Iran \nignored its international obligations, there \nwould be consequences; in 2011, he did the \nsame; and in 2012, he made it clear that he \nwould prevent Iran from acquiring a \nnuclear weapon and take no option off the \ntable. Obama repeated half of what he said \nin 2012 about preventing Iran from getting \na nuclear weapon, but instead of saying all \noptions were on the table, he spoke of the \nimportance of diplomacy. I suspect he'll go \nto extreme lengths to avoid war, and won't \ngreenlight an Israeli attack either until the \narc of diplomacy has run its course. And \nthen Obama would likely act only if the \nmullahs push the envelope by accelerating \ntheir uranium enrichment program and \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 028681 \nother military aspects of the nuclear \nenterprise. \nSeizing the Nuclear High Road with Little \nto Lose \nEven as he confronts a real bomb in North \nKorea (very bad options there) and a \npotential one in Iran (bad options there \ntoo), Obama is trying to make good on a \nlongstanding commitment to reduce \nAmerica's own nuclear arsenal. Backed by \nthe military chiefs and likely by the public \ntoo (getting rid of nukes equals saving \nmoney), but opposed by Republicans in \nCongress, Obama will try to work around \nthe political obstacles by seeking a deal \nwith yes ... you got it ... his old friend Vlad \nPutin. It's worth a try. If Putin balks or \nRepublicans get in the way, the president \ncan always advocate unilateral cuts -- not \nsomething he wants to do. But if he can't \nhave his way on nukes, he can always \nblame it on the Russians and the \nRepublicans with little to lose. The road to \ngetting rid of nukes is a long one. Let the \nnext guy (or gal) worry about it. \nA Little Leg on Palestine? \nObama hasn't mentioned the Israeli-\nPalestinian conflict in a SOTU speech since \n2009. And that's no coincidence. His own \npoorly thought-through initial effort \ncrashed and burned, leaving the president \npretty frustrated and annoyed with both \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 028682 \nIsraelis and Palestinians, particularly Israeli \nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. \nBut hey, that was then. A second-term \npresident has committed himself early in \n2013 to a trip to Israel and has an Energizer \nbunny in Secretary of State John Kerry, \nwho wants to do the right thing and keep \nthe two-state solution alive. Obama clearly \nkept his distance from the issue again on \nTuesday night. He spoke of standing with \nIsrael to pursue peace, but didn't mention \nPalestinians or the peace process. He \nmentioned his own trip to the Middle East, \nbut missed an opportunity to give what \nmight be a trip to the region by his new \nsecretary of state higher profile. It's just as \nwell. The paradox of the Israeli-Palestinian \nissue is that it's too complicated to \nimplement right now and too important to \nabandon. It's in this space that Obama will \nbe forced to operate. And while the odds of \nsuccess are low, Obama will be tempted in \nhis final term to do something bold, \nperhaps laying out a U.S. plan of \nparameters on the key final-status issues. \nIt's the Middle Class, Not the Middle East \nSpoiler alert: Barack Obama might still be \na consequential foreign-policy president if \nhe's lucky, willful, and skillful. But it's his \ndomestic legacy that will make or break his \npresidency. Health care -- his signature \nlegacy issue -- will look much better if the \neconomy improves, driven by a revived \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 028683 \nhousing market and rising employment, \nand of course if some broader deal can be \nstruck on entitlements and taxes. \nImmigration reform and gun-control \nlegislation driven by a functional \nbipartisanship would cement that legacy. \nHe'd be an historic rather than a great \npresident. \nTwo clocks tick down in a president's \nsecond term: the drive for legacy and the \nreality of lame duckery. Obama's political \ncapital will diminish quickly. Where, how, \nand on what he wants to spend it is critical. \nThe Middle East is violent and volatile and \nmay yet suck him in, but if he can avoid it, \nhe'll try. This was a State of the Union \naddress that stressed fixing America's \nbroken house, not chasing around the world \ntrying to fix everyone else's. The future of \nAmerica isn't Cairo or Damascus; it's \nChicago and Detroit. \nAaron David Miller is a distinguished \nscholar at the Woodrow Wilson \nInternational Center for Scholars. \nArticle 3. \nAgence Global \nCan the United States  \nStrike a Deal with Iran?  \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 028684 \nPatrick Seale \n12 Feb 2013 -- Negotiations with Iran are \nonce more on the international agenda. \nAfter an eight-month break, the five \npermanent members of the UN Security \nCouncil plus Germany -- the so-called \nP5+1 -- are due to hold a meeting with Iran \non 25 February in Kazakhstan. What are \nthe prospects of success? In a nutshell, that \nwould seem to depend more on the climate \nin Washington than in Tehran. Iran is \ngesturing that it wants to negotiate, but \nWashington has not yet signalled any \ngreater flexibility than in the past. \nIn a major speech in Tehran last Sunday, \nPresident Mahmoud Ahmadinejad \naddressed the United States: \"Take your \nguns out of the face of the Iranian nation \nand I myself will negotiate with you,\" he \ndeclared. Meanwhile, the Iranian \nambassador to Paris told French officials \nthat, provided a work plan was agreed, Iran \nwas ready to allow inspectors of the \nInternational Atomic Energy Agency \n(IAEA) to visit Parchin, a military facility \nwhere Iran is suspected of having done \nwork on atomic weapons. Ahmadinejad \nhimself has said repeatedly that Iran was \nready to stop enriching uranium to 20% if \nthe international community agreed to \nsupply it instead to the Tehran research \nreactor for the production of isotopes \nneeded to treat cancer patients. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 028685 \nThe only recent encouraging word from the \nUnited States was a hint by Vice-President \nJoe Biden at last week's Munich security \nconference that the time may have come \nfor bilateral U.S.-Iranian talks. Iran's \nForeign Minister Ali Akbar Salehi \nresponded positively to Biden's offer, \nalthough he added that Iran would look for \nevidence that Biden's offer was 'authentic' \nand not 'devious'. \nThe road to a U.S.-Iranian agreement is \nlittered with obstacles -- grave mutual \ndistrust being one of them. There is little \noptimism among experts that a \nbreakthrough is imminent. For one thing, \nIran is almost certain to want to defer any \nmajor strategic decision until a new \nPresident is elected next June to replace the \nsharp-tongued Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. To \nstrike a deal with Iran, the United States \nwould also need to assure its Arab allies in \nthe Gulf that they would not fall under \nIranian hegemony or lose American \nprotection. Guarantees would no doubt \nhave to be given. \nIsrael, America's close ally, poses a more \nsubstantial obstacle. It is totally opposed to \nany deal which would allow Iran to enrich \nuranium, even at the low level of 3.5%. \nWanting no challenge to its own \nformidable nuclear arsenal, Israel's long-\nstanding aim has been to halt Iran's nuclear \nprogramme altogether. To this end it has \nassassinated several Iranian nuclear \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 028686 \nscientists and joined the United States in \nwaging cyber warfare against Iranian \nnuclear facilities. Its belligerent prime \nminister, Binyamin Netanyahu, has for \nyears been pressing Obama to destroy \nIran's nuclear programme and -- better still \n-- bring down the Islamic regime \naltogether. \nFaced with these obstacles, it is clear that \nany U.S. deal with Iran would require \ncareful preparation. Obama would need to \nmobilize strong domestic support if he is to \nconfront America's vast array of pro-Israeli \nforces. They include Congressmen eager to \ndefend Israeli interests at all costs (as was \nvividly illustrated by the recent Chuck \nHagel confirmation hearings), powerful \nlobbies such as AIPAC, media barons, \nhigh-profile Jewish financiers like Sheldon \nAdelson, a phalanx of neo-con strategists in \nright-wing think tanks, influential pro-\nIsraelis within the Administration, and \nmany, many others. The cost in political \ncapital of challenging them could be very \nsubstantial. Nevertheless, elected for a \nsecond term, he now has greater freedom \nand authority than before. \nObama is due to visit Israel on March 20-\n21, something he did not do in his first \nterm. This visit will be the first foreign trip \nof his second term -- in itself a sign of its \nimportance. Although the White House is \nanxious to play down suggestions that he \nwill announce a major initiative, either on \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 028687 \nthe Israeli-Palestinian conflict or on Iran, \nthere are issues he cannot avoid. He may, \nhowever, choose to raise them in private \ntalks with Israeli leaders rather than in \npublic. His message is expected to be \ntwofold: Israel should not delay in granting \nstatehood to the Palestinians, however \npainful that choice may be, and it should be \ncareful not to make an eternal enemy of \nIran. Both conflicts have the potential to \nisolate Israel internationally and threaten its \nlong-term interests, if not its actual \nexistence. \nIn his first term of office, Obama resisted \nNetanyahu's pressure to wage war on Iran. \nThis was no more than a semi-success, \nhowever, since he managed to blunt \nNetanyahu's belligerence only by imposing \non Iran a raft of sanctions of unprecedented \nseverity. They have halved Iran's oil \nexports, caused its currency to plummet \nand inflation to gallop, severed its relations \nwith the world's banks and inflicted severe \nhardship on its population. \nThe key question today is this: What are \nObama's intentions? Is he seeking to bring \ndown Iran's Islamic regime, as Israel \nwould like, or is he simply seeking to limit \nits nuclear ambitions? If 'regime change' is \nhis aim then sanctions will have to be \ntightened even further and extended \nindefinitely. But if Obama's aim is to strike \na deal with Iran over its nuclear programme \nthen he must give it at least some of what it \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 028688 \nwants: such as sanctions relief; acceptance \nof its right under the Nuclear Non-\nProliferation Treaty to enrich uranium to a \nlow level for peaceful purposes; \nrecognition of its security interests, of the \nlegitimacy of its Islamic regime born out of \nthe 1979 revolution, and of its place in the \nregion as a major power. \nThe P5+1, which are due to meet Iran later \nthis month, remain so divided that they are \nunlikely to improve substantially on their \nprevious miserly offer, which was to \nprovide Iran with some airplane spare parts \nif it gave up uranium enrichment to 20% --\nits trump card. It is the paralysis of Iran's \ndealings with the P5+1 that has lent \ncredence to the idea that the best hope of a \nbreakthrough may lie in bilateral U.S.-\nIranian talks -- perhaps even a summit \nmeeting between President Obama and \nAyatollah Khomeini. \nFor such a summit to be successful the \nUnited States would have to change its \napproach. Iran's supreme leader has made \nclear that Iran will not negotiate under \nthreat of attack. There would have to be \ngive and take. Above all, Iran wants to be \ntreated with respect. This is the challenge \nfacing Obama. \nIt is worth remembering that there is as yet \nno evidence whatsoever that Iran has \ndecided to build nuclear weapons. Nor has \nit developed a reliable delivery system. \nInstead, it has focussed its efforts on \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 028689 \nmedium-range missiles unable to reach \nIsrael. It has no second strike capability. As \nPresident Ahmadinejad stressed during his \nvisit to Cairo last week, Iran has no \nintention of attacking Israel. Its posture is \npurely defensive. \nIf Obama were to act with boldness and \nvision, he could defuse a nagging problem \nwhich has plagued the region for years. It is \nsurely time for the United States to draw \nIran into the regional community of nations \nand put an end to 34 years of unremitting \nhostility. \nPatrick Seale is a leading British writer on \nthe Middle East. His latest book is The \nStruggle for Arab Independence: Riad el-\nSolh and the Makers of the Modern Middle \nEast (Cambridge University Press). \nArticle 4. \nThe Washington Post \nWhat path now for Syria?  \nDavid Ignatius  \nFebruary 12, 2013 -- Syrian opposition \nfighters appear to be making significant  \ngains on the battlefield this week, \nfollowing an offer by their top political \nleader for negotiations with the regime of \nPresident Bashar al-Assad. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 028690 \nThis military and diplomatic news may \nappear positive. But Syrian sources caution \nthat the battlefield advances may accelerate \nmovement toward a breakup of the country, \nas Alawite supporters of the regime retreat \nto their ancestral homeland in the \nnorthwestern region around Latakia. And \nthere's no sign that either Assad or his \nRussian patrons are paying any more than \nlip service to a political settlement. \nOne potential game-changer is a request for \nU.S. help in training elite rebel units, which \nhas been drafted by Brig. Gen. Salim Idriss, \nthe new commander of the opposition Free \nSyrian Army. In a letter dated Feb. 4, he \nseeks U.S. assistance in \"training for: (1) \nspecial operations; (2) international \nhumanitarian law; and (3) ... in chemical \nweapons security.\" \nIdriss requested various supplies for these \nelite units, including: \"(1) combat armor; \n(2) night vision goggles; (3) hand held \nmonocular and longer range spotting \nequipment; (4) strategic communications; \n(5) winterization packs; and (6) tactical \ncommunications.\" \nThis request for assistance was made just \nafter the Assad regime had rebuffed an \noffer by Sheik Ahmad Moaz al-Khatib, the \nhead of a new opposition coalition, to \nnegotiate with government representatives. \nThe rebels' recent military successes have \ncome mostly in northern Syria; the attacks \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 028691 \nwere made by different battalions that \nappear to operate with little central \ncommand and control. The gains include: \n*The al-Jarrah air base, about 30 miles east \nof Aleppo, which appears to have been \noverrun by fighters from Ahrar al-Sham, a \nbattalion based in Idlib. Videos posted \nTuesday by the rebels showed them \nwalking past derelict Syrian warplanes and \ninside a fortified hangar containing what \nappeared to be two Czech-built ground \nassault planes. On camera, the rebels \ndisplayed dozens of bombs racked in a \nwarehouse, and other ammunition and \nspoils of war. \n*The Thawra hydroelectric dam on the \nEuphrates, which is one of Syria's biggest \npower-generating facilities. Rebel sources \nsaid the Syrian army gave up the strategic \ndam after army positions there were \noverrun. The rebels negotiated a surrender \nwith regime loyalists who remained. These \nsources said the dam continues to operate \nand provide power — a positive sign for \nthose who worry that Syria's infrastructure \nwould collapse if the rebels took over. \n*The Aleppo International Airport, \nsoutheast of the city, is close to falling. \nFree Syrian Army sources said Tuesday \nthat their fighters, including allies in the \nextremist al-Nusra Front, had captured an \naccess point near the airport known as \n\"Liwa 80.\" Syrian sources said rebels there \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 028692 \nhad seized large amounts of ammunition, \nincluding some shoulder-fired anti-aircraft \nmissiles. \n*Damascus and its suburbs, where the \nrebels are tightening their squeeze on \naccess points to the capital. Syrian sources \nsaid fighters are converging on Damascus \nfrom different parts of the country, \nexpecting a decisive battle there soon. \n\"Regime forces are suffering from very low \nmorale, whereas FSA soldiers have been \nencouraged by recent positive \ndevelopments,\" asserts one FSA report \nfrom Damascus. \nThe al-Nusra Front has been a catalyst and \nbeneficiary of the rebels' success. \nAccording to Syrian sources, al-Nusra is \ngaining strength in Homs, a city in central \nSyria where the group was never strong. \nOne Syrian source told the State \nDepartment: \"They have money, they are \nhelping people with everything including \ndaily living supplies. I heard that some \nfighters are leaving their [former] brigades \nand joining [Al-Nusra], some of them \nselling their weapons to feed their \nfamilies.\" \nOne Syrian who works closely with the \nFree Syrian Army explained how creating \nan elite commando force could help check \nSyria's drift toward becoming a failed \nstate: \"We still believe FSA on the ground \nis still needed badly to tip the power and \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 028693 \nsupport other parallel solutions, including \nthe political one. But FSA [has] become a \njungle. ... My recommendation is ... to \nstart working on elite [forces that can] ... \ninitiate key attacks plus help as a buffer \nfrom potential warlords and fights among \nfragmented FSA factions. Plus, this unit \ncan handle other key tasks, like securing \nchemical weapons.\" \nThis Syrian strategist argues in another \nmemo that the rebels must \"speak to the \nsilent majority, many who did not care \nabout the revolution, and they want their \nlife back.\" He said that such a negotiated \nsettlement requires more pressure on the \nUnited States, Russia and the United \nNations \"to find a way out of the \ndeadlock.\" \nArticle 5 \nForeign Policy \nWhy Does Europe  \nPretend Hezbollah Has a  \nGood Side?  \nMatthew Levitt \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 028694 \nFebruary 12, 2013 -- Bulgaria's interior \nminister announced on Feb. 5 the result of \nhis country's investigation into the July \n2012 bombing of a bus filled with Israeli \ntourists in the city of Burgas, which killed \nfive Israelis and the vehicle's Bulgarian \ndriver. Two of the individuals who carried \nout the terrorist attack, he said, \"belonged \nto the military formation of Hezbollah.\" \nIt was not by chance that his statement \nfingered only the military wing of \nHezbollah, not the group as a whole. \nWithin the European Union, the findings of \nthe Bulgarian investigation have kicked off \na firestorm over whether to add the \nLebanese militant organization -- in whole, \nor perhaps just its military or terrorist \nwings -- to the EU's list of banned terrorist \ngroups. But are there in fact distinct wings \nwithin the self-styled \"Party of God\"? \nHezbollah is many things. It is one of the \ndominant political parties in Lebanon, as \nwell as a social and religious movement \ncatering first and foremost -- though not \nexclusively -- to Lebanon's Shiite \ncommunity. Hezbollah is also Lebanon's \nlargest militia, the only one to keep its \nweapons and rebrand its armed elements as \nan \"Islamic resistance\" in response to the \nterms of the 1989 Taif Accord, which \nended the Lebanese Civil War. \nWhile the group's various elements are \nintended to complement one another, the \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 028695 \nreality is often messier. In part, that has to \ndo with compartmentalization of \nHezbollah's covert activities. It is also, \nhowever, a result of the group's multiple \nidentities -- Lebanese, pan-Shiite, pro-\nIranian -- and the group's multiple and \nsometimes competing goals tied to these \ndifferent identities. \nHezbollah's ideological commitment to \nIranian Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini's \nrevolutionary doctrine of velayat-e \nfaqih (guardianship of the jurist), which \nholds that a Shiite Islamic cleric should \nserve as the supreme head of government, \nis a key source of conflict. The group is \nthus simultaneously committed to the \ndecrees of Iranian clerics, the Lebanese \nstate, its sectarian Shiite community within \nLebanon, and fellow Shiites abroad. \nThe consequences of these competing \nideological drivers was clear in July 2006, \nwhen Hezbollah dragged Israel and \nLebanon into a war neither state wanted by \ncrossing the U.N.-demarcated border \nbetween the two countries, killing three \nIsraeli soldiers, and kidnapping two more \nin an ambush. They came to the fore again \ntwo years later, when Hezbollah took over \nWest Beirut by force of arms, turning its \nweapons of \"resistance\" against fellow \nLebanese citizens. When the chips are \ndown, Hezbollah's commitment to Iran \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 028696 \ntrumps its identity as a Lebanese political \nmovement. \nThe ties that bind Hezbollah's political \nleadership with its international illicit \nactivities are also unmistakable. According \nto a CIA document, even before Hassan \nNasrallah rose to the position of secretary-\ngeneral in 1992, he was \"directly involved \nin many Hizballah terrorist operations, \nincluding hostage taking, airline hijackings, \nand attacks against Lebanese rivals.\" \nTime and again, Hezbollah's political \npersonalities have been tied to the group's \nterrorist and criminal activities. Consider a \nmajor case in the United States: In 2008, \nwhile Hezbollah operative Ali Karaki was \nplanning a Hezbollah attack in Azerbaijan's \ncapital, Baku, his brother, Hasan Antar \nKaraki, was helping lead a broad criminal \nconspiracy to sell counterfeit and stolen \ncurrency in Philadelphia. Luckily, Hasan \nAntar Karaki sold his wares to an \nundercover FBI informant posing as a \nmember of the Philadelphia criminal \nunderworld. Hasan Antar Karaki proved to \nbe a major figure in Hezbollah's forgery \noperations, and he provided an FBI source \nwith fraudulent British and Canadian \npassports. \nMeanwhile, in meetings in Lebanon and \nthe United States, Hasan Antar Karaki's \nassociate, Hassan Hodroj, a Hezbollah \nspokesman and the head of its Palestinian \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 028697 \nissues portfolio within the group's political \nechelon, sought to procure a long list of \nsophisticated weapons in a black-market \nscheme involving Hezbollah operatives \nacross the globe. According to court \ndocuments, Hodroj wanted \"heavy \nmachinery\" for the \"fight against Jews and \nto protect Lebanon.\" But move forward \nwith caution, Hodroj counseled an \nundercover FBI source, because someone \nin the United States could \"go to jail for \n100 years\" if caught dealing with \nHezbollah. \nIn light of cases like this one, in which \npeople overtly affiliated with Hezbollah's \npolitical activities are engaged in criminal \nand terrorist activities, it becomes \nincreasingly difficult to separate \nHezbollah's overt activities from its covert \nbehavior. \"Little is known about [the \nHezbollah military wing's] internal \ncommand hierarchy,\" a Western \ngovernment report noted in 2012, \"due to \nits highly secretive nature and use of \nsophisticated protective measures.\" \nThe structure and manpower of Hezbollah's \nterrorist operation, which is responsible for \nits financial and logistical activities as well \nas its terrorist operations abroad, are \nsimilarly opaque. We do know, however, \nthat Hezbollah's terrorist network, the \nIslamic Jihad Organization (IJO), was \nformally founded in 1983 when Hezbollah \nmaster terrorist Imad Mughniyeh fled to \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 028698 \nIran after orchestrating the October 1983 \nbombing of the U.S. Marine Corps and \nFrench military barracks in Beirut with his \nbrother-in-law, Mustafa Badreddine. \nThis much is clear: Since its founding, \nHezbollah has developed a sophisticated \norganizational and leadership structure. \nThe overall governing authority, the Majlis \nal-Shura (Consultative Council), wields all \ndecision-making power and directs several \nsubordinate functional councils. Each \nfunctional council reports directly to the \nMajlis al-Shura, which, as Hezbollah \nDeputy Secretary-General Naim Qassem \nwrote in his book, is \"in charge of drawing \nthe overall vision and policies, overseeing \nthe general strategies for the party's \nfunction, and taking political decisions.\" \nU.S. assessments echo Qassem's \ndescription. \"Hezbollah has a unified \nleadership structure that oversees the \norganization's complementary, partially \ncompartmentalized elements,\" reads a \nCongressional Research Service report. \nThe secretary-general, currently Nasrallah, \npresides over the Majlis al-Shura and \nfunctions as the group's leader under the \nauthority of the \"jurist theologian\" \nAyatollah Ali Khamenei, Iran's supreme \nleader. Five administrative bodies, \norganized around thematic responsibilities, \nrun Hezbollah's political, military (jihad), \nparliamentary, executive, and judicial \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 028699 \nactivities. The Majlis al-Shura considers all \nelements of the group's activities, including \nits political and military wings, as part of \none holistic entity. \nAccording to Hezbollah's top officials, this \nunity of purpose among the group's diverse \nactivities is essential to its success. \"If the \nmilitary wing were separated from the \npolitical wing, this would have \nrepercussions, and it would reflect on the \npolitical scene,\" Qassem told a Lebanese \npaper in 2000. \"Hezbollah's secretary-\ngeneral is the head of the Shura Council \nand also the head of the Jihad Council, and \nthis means that we have one leadership, \nwith one administration.\" \nThe Jihad Council is the functional council \nunderneath the Majlis al-Shura responsible \nfor all military matters. Qassem writes that \nit \"comprises those in charge of resistance \nactivity, be that in terms of oversight, \nrecruitment, training, equipment, security, \nor any other resistance-related endeavors.\" \nTo accomplish its mission, the council is \ndivided into several smaller units in charge \nof protecting the leadership and carrying \nout internal and external surveillance, as \nwell as overseas operations. The party's \nsecurity branch is further broken down into \nthree subgroups: central, preventive, and \noverseas security. In 2000, a dedicated \ncounterintelligence branch was reportedly  \nfounded as well. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 028700 \nUnder this structure, Hezbollah's militia \nand terrorist activities, along with its \nsecurity organ, all report to the Jihad \nCouncil. Until he was killed, Mughniyeh \nwas Hezbollah's top militant commander \nand reportedly led the Jihad Council \nhimself By some accounts, he also held a \nseat on the Majlis al-Shura, which would \nbe typical for the party's standing military \ncommander. \nUnlike its sister councils, however, the \nJihad Council enjoys strategic ambiguity. \nNeither the majority of Hezbollah officials \nnor the party's elected parliamentarians are \naware of the details of their party's covert \nmilitary and terrorist activities, which are \ndecided on by the most senior leadership. \nAccording to the U.S. government, these \nactivities are \"executed\" by the leadership \nof Hezbollah's military apparatus, known \nas the Islamic Resistance and led by \nBadreddine, and by the IJO, led by Talal \nHamiyah, and they are \"overseen\" by \nNasrallah. \nEurope's approach to Hezbollah has been \nvaried. Many European governments have \nresisted international efforts to designate \nthe organization as a terrorist group by \ndistinguishing between Hezbollah's \npolitical and military wings. Britain \ndistinguishes among Hezbollah's terrorist \nwing (the Islamic Jihad Organization), \nmilitary wing, and political wing, and the \ncountry banned the IJO in 2000 and the \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 028701 \nmilitary wing in 2008. The Netherlands, \nhowever, designated Hezbollah a terrorist \nentity in 2004 without distinguishing \nbetween the group's political and military \nwings. A 2004 Dutch intelligence report \nhighlighted investigations that show \n\"Hezbollah's political and terrorist wings \nare controlled by one co-ordinating \ncouncil.\" \nThe European Union has taken action \nagainst Hezbollah's interests in the past. In \nMay 2002, the European Union froze the \nassets of a non-European terrorist group for \nthe first time by adding seven Hezbollah-\naffiliated individuals, including \nMughniyeh, to its financial sanctions list \nfor terrorism. It did not, however, sanction \nHezbollah as an organization. On March \n10, 2005, the European Parliament passed a \nnonbinding resolution recognizing that \n\"clear evidence exists of terrorist activities \non the part of Hezbollah\" and calling on the \nEuropean Council to take \"all necessary \nsteps to curtail them.\" \nBut the necessary steps did not occur. \nInstead, most European countries preferred \nto make convenient distinctions between \nthe different parts of Hezbollah, even when \nthe group's own leadership does not. \nToday, as European leaders consider \nwhether to label Hezbollah a terrorist \ngroup, they should judge the group by the \ntotality of its actions. Hezbollah cannot be \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 028702 \nforgiven its criminal, terrorist, or militant \npursuits simply because it also engages in \npolitical or humanitarian ones. As the \nBurgas bus bombing demonstrates, the \nParty of God can and has mobilized \noperatives for everything from criminal \nenterprises to terrorist attacks well beyond \nLebanon's borders. \nAnd though Hezbollah is composed of \nmultiple committees and branches, it \noperates as a single entity. Hezbollah, the \nU.S. intelligence community has \ndetermined, is \"a multifaceted, disciplined \norganization that combines political, social, \nparamilitary, and terrorist elements\" and is \none in which decisions \"to resort to arms or \nterrorist tactics [are] carefully calibrated.\" \nHezbollah's Qassem, speaking in October \n2012, concurred: \"We don't have a military \nwing and a political one; we don't have \nHezbollah on one hand and the resistance \nparty on the other.... Every element of \nHezbollah, from commanders to members \nas well as our various capabilities, are in \nthe service of the resistance, and we have \nnothing but the resistance as a priority,\" he \nsaid. \nMaybe it is time Western leaders finally \nlistened to him. \nMatthew Levitt directs the Stein program \non Counterterrorism and Intelligence at the \nWashington Institute for Near East Policy. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 028703 \nHe is author of \"Hizballah and the Qods  \nForce in Iran's Shadow War with the West\" \nand the forthcoming book Hezbollah: The \nGlobal Footprint of Lebanon's Party of \nGod. \nArticle 6. \nThe Atlantic \nA Middle-Class Paradise  \nin Palestine?  \nArmin Rosen \nFeb 11 2013 -- The sole outlet to Rawabi  \nsits off a dizzying two-lane highway \nflanked by round, scraggly hills. In this part \nof the West Bank, just north of where the \nJerusalem suburbs thin into a dry, granite-\ngray wilderness, the mountains seem to aid \nin the illusion that Israeli and Palestinian \nspheres of authority can remain perfectly, \neven harmoniously separate. Arabs use the \nroad to get to the Palestinian-controlled \ncities of Bir Zeit and Ramallah, for Jewish \nIsraelis, the road connects the Jerusalem \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 028704 \narea to settlements deep inside the northern \nhalf of the West Bank. \nRamallah's skyline is barely discernible on \na hazy day. Ateret, a red-gabled settlement \nof about 90 families that sits high above the \nRawabi junction -- a community which \nwould likely either be vacated or \nincorporated into a Palestinian state under a \nfuture peace agreement -- flickers in and \nout of view with every delirious knot in the \nroad. Even a concrete pillbox looming over \nthe highest point along the highway is \nabandoned, its connection to the territory's \noddly invisible occupying army marked \nonly by a tattered Israeli flag that no one \nhas bothered to steal or replace. \nLast year was the first since 1973 in which \nno Israeli citizen was killed in a terrorist \nattack originating from the West Bank. As \non the newly-pacified Gaza-Israel border, a \ntense quiet pervades things here, although a \nbright red sign at the junction reminds one \ncategory of motorist not to feel too \ncomplacent. \"This road leads to Area 'A' \nUnder the Palestinian Authority,\" it reads \nin Arabic, Hebrew, and broken English. \n\"The entrance for Israeli citizens is \nforbidden, dangerous to your lives and is \nagainst the Israeli law.\" At the Rawabi \njunction these warnings of latent danger are \nalmost comically off-base, partly because \nof the only other marker at the turnoff: a \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 028705 \nlight-green arrow sagging off of a nearby \npost. \nNo one lives at the end of the road, which \nis every bit as wavy and disorienting as the \nadjoining highway. It empties into a scene \nthat seems engineered for maximum \nbewilderment: three high-rise cranes, \ntopped with fluttering Palestinian flags, \ntower over massive stone and concrete \nbuilding frames. Cement-mixers, painted \nthe same shade of light green as the arrow \nat the turnoff and marked with the project's \nlogo -- a wiry oval with a cute little convex \nloop at the end, like a child's drawing of a \nheart that could also be a tree -- line up to \nreceive material from a buzzing, state-of-\nthe-art plant. The construction site, a \ncouple turns up-road of the cement factory, \nis swarming with workers in green \nhardhats. Spotless SUVs with the Rawabi \nlogo on the door speed from one side of the \nsite to another. \nRawabi, which will be the first Palestinian \nplanned city in the West Bank, runs from \nthe top of the mountain to the valley below, \nwith its highest point sitting at an elevation \nslightly higher than Ateret, which is now \nconstantly visible. In contrast, the chaos of \nRamallah, stronghold of an insolvent and \nsclerotic Palestinian Authority, feels distant \nin more senses than one. \nRawabi represents something totally new --\na visionary Palestinian-directed private \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 028706 \nsector project, with support from both \nIsraeli businesses and a major Arab \ngovernment. It has the potential to shift the \nconversation on the region's future on both \nsides of the Green Line. It could convince \nPalestinians -- and the rest of the world --\nthat the future of the West Bank shouldn't \nbe shackled to Ramallah or Jerusalem's \nvacillating willingness to hash out \nfundamental issues. It could prove that \nthere's an appetite, both among Palestinian \nconsumers and foreign donors, for the \ncreation of a social and economic existence \nin the West Bank that's de-coupled, \ninsomuch as currently possible, from the \nMiddle East's tense and labyrinthine \npolitics. \nIt would also help solidify the benefits of \nthe current cessation in hostilities. Indeed, \nPalestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas's \nprogress in fostering the end of violent \nresistance in the West Bank in the years \nafter the bloody Second Intifada, coupled \nwith Palestinian Prime Minister Salaam \nFayyad's widely-respected institution-\nbuilding initiative, could get a crucial \nprivate sector assist through Rawabi's \neventual success. \nAnd Rawabi gets at something even more \nfundamental. \"It touches upon all of the \ncore issues of control and sovereignty,\" \nsays Robert Danin, a fellow at the Council \non Foreign Relations who, as head of the \nQuartet mission in Jerusalem from 2008 to \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 028707 \n2010, witnessed some of the political \ndiscussions that accompanied the project's \ncreation. \"This could be a huge, iconic \nvictory for the whole strategy of building \nPalestine from the bottom up rather than \ntrying to build it at the negotiating table,\" \nhe says. \nIts success would prove just how much \npower Palestinians can, and indeed already \ndo, have in shaping their future. And its \nfailure could prove the exact opposite. \nI visited Rawabi two weeks ago with a \ngroup of national security professionals, as \npart of a trip organized by the Foundation \nfor Defense of Democracies, a Washington, \nDC-based think tank. (All of the photos in \nthe body of the article are mine.) We were \ntaken around the construction site by a \nyoung Palestinian engineer who conveyed \nthe vast ambition underlying the project: \nWhen the city is completed, she said, it will \nhouse 45,000 people in 23 distinct \nneighborhoods with innocuous, nature-\nbased names like \"Flint,\" and \"Hard Rock\". \n(Rawabi is Arabic for \"Hills\".) There will \nbe eight schools -- some of them built with \nthe help of the U.S. Agency for \nInternational Development -- a \"huge \npark,\" a convention center, an 850-seat \nindoor theater, and a 20,000-seat \namphitheater carved into a hillside. \nMost ambitiously, there will be a \ncommercial center that developers hope \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 028708 \nwill bring in between 3,000 and 5,000 \npermanent jobs within the next five years --\nhopefully, we were told, in the \ninformational technology sector (an \naspiration that might imply a certain \ncooperation with the burgeoning tech \nindustry on the other side of the Green \nLine). The engineer said that Rawabi had \nalready created 3,000 construction jobs for \nWest Bank Palestinians. The city is \nPalestinian-designed and Palestinian-built - \n- making the surfeit of Qatari flags at the \nconstruction site somewhat puzzling at \nfirst. And while the project does not \npurchase materials from Jewish settlements \nin the West Bank, the engineer was hardly \nshy in explaining that Rawabi would add \nan estimated $85 million to the Israeli \neconomy. \nAs we drove around the construction site, \nthe engineer's talk made few demands on \nthe imagination. The sheer scale of the \nproject is already obvious. Within the next \n18 months, the first phase, which includes \nsix neighborhoods, a mosque, the \namphitheater, and two-thirds of the city's \ncommercial center, will be complete, and \n3,000 people are scheduled will move into \nRawabi by the end of 2013. Apartment \nblocks built of a local white stone --\n\"Rawabi stone,\" the engineer called it -- are \nalready rising out of a network of \nconcentric ring-roads centered on the top of \nthe hill. Most of these roads have already \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 028709 \nbeen paved, and there are terraced retaining \nwalls, built out of thick stacks of local \nsandstone, running all the way to the \nbottom of the valley. No bleachers have \nbeen installed in the amphitheater yet, but \nit's fairly far along, with the future seating \narea fanning into a wide notch in the \nmountainside. There are attractive stone \nsigns bearing the stylized Arabic names of \nneighborhoods that haven't been built yet. \nThe future commercial center is also well \non its way to completion. Situated on a \nshelf slightly below the summit of the hill, \nthe complex of office buildings, hotels, \ntheaters, and a convention center will \nhuddle around a broad outdoor plaza, \nwhich will be connected to the lower \nneighborhoods through a wide flight of \nstairs. The stairs, plaza, and central \nbuildings are already past their skeletal \nphase, and the high-rise apartments ringing \nthe city center look like they're almost \ncomplete. For now, the commercial core is \na jumble of dust and brutal concrete \nsurfaces, but in the future, someone \nlingering in the cafés near the staircase will \nenjoy phenomenal views of the rugged hill \ncountry, and perhaps even glimpses of the \nJordan River Valley on a clear day. \nIt is still possible to remain unconvinced of \nRawabi's reality -- doubtful as to whether \nthat café will ever be built, or whether any \nmiddle class-Palestinian desirous of a \ngeneric middle class existence will ever \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 028710 \nlinger there. There's abundant reason for \nskepticism. The project's future depends on \nthe Israeli authorities' willingness to allow \nfor the construction of access roads in \n\"Area C,\" or West Bank territory under the \ndirect control of Israel. The sole existing \nroute into the city only exists because the \nIsraeli government, after years of \nbureaucratic and high-level diplomatic \nwrangling, granted Rawabi's developers a \npermit for a \"temporary\" road. Technically, \nthey will have to destroy the road when the \ncurrent permission expires. And even if the \nIsraelis agree to make the road permanent, \none two-lane route is hardly adequate for a \ncity of 45,000 people. Developers claim it \nisn't even adequate to the needs of the \ncurrent construction site. \nWater is another challenge. Negotiations \nwith Israel and the Palestinian Water \nAuthority are ongoing, and developers say \nthey have held in excess of 100 meetings \nwith Israeli officials on water-related issues \nalone. Developers admit that they aren't \nsure where the city's water resources will \neventually come from, and the construction \nsite only got running water two months \nago. \nAnd they'll admit that attracting jobs to the \nsite is an even bigger challenge than Israel's \nWest Bank regime. Rawabi isn't meant to \nbe a bedroom community of Ramallah. It's \nmeant to be a self-contained city, with \noffice and retail space. The jobs haven't \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 028711 \nquite materialized yet (although the \ndevelopers have a slight head start: \nbetween 200 and 300 call center-type jobs \ncurrently based in Ramallah are scheduled \nto move into Rawabi when the first phase \nof construction is complete). If the political \nor security situation seriously deteriorates - \n- if the checkpoints return, if the Israelis are \nforced to re-occupy urban areas ceded to \nthe Palestinian Authority under the Oslo \nAccords, as happened during the Second \nIntifada; if Hamas wages a violent takeover \nof the Palestinian government -- all bets are \noff The developers don't seem to be \nbothered by those possibilities right now. \nAt the showroom, built at the very top of \nthe hill, the future is nothing but bright. \nI chatted with another site engineer as we \nwalked through a scale-model mock-up of \na typical Rawabian street, where happy \nfamilies in western dress waved from little \nvideo screens inset in plastic apartment \nwindows. I asked her about the Qatari flags \nI had seen around the construction site. \nQatar's state investment fund is footing two \nthirds of the nearly $1 billion project bill, \nshe said. \"This is the biggest investment in \nthe history of Palestine,\" she explained as \nwe stepped over a fake valley in the next \nroom, walking past a mock-up of a \nstunning hilltop view contained inside a \nmock-up of a future apartment suite. The \nRawabians will apparently own large flat-\nscreen TVs and stylish coffee tables, and \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 028712 \ntheir living spaces will be kept mercilessly \nclean. \nWhat, of that $1 billion investment, was \ngoing to Israel, I asked? Israeli companies \nwere providing cement powder and sand, \nshe said, and the project had consulted with \n\"Israeli experts.\" \"In some cases, you have \nto do that,\" she said, alluding to the \ncomparative difficulty of importing \nbuilding materials through neighboring \nJordan. In other words, working with the \nIsraelis was a necessary business decision \nfor a project this large and complex. \nThe fake street, fake valley, fake \napartment-display ended in a pleasant sky-\nlit lobby, where representatives of the \nCairo Amman Bank, Arab Islamic Bank, \nand Arab Bank sat in logoed glass cubicles, \navailable to discuss financing for future \npurchases. And for the still-skeptical, \nthere's a six-minute 3-D movie, where the \ncity appears in its completed glory -- a \nplace where families picnic, men in \nbusiness dress greet each other amid \nbustling plazas, and fireworks crest over \nsoaring apartment towers topped with solar \npanels. The architecture is tasteful. These \naren't dachas plunked on fake islands off \nthe coast of Dubai. It's the kind of place \nwhere I, or just about anyone in the world \nwith middle or even upper-middle class \naspirations, would want to live. And it \nlooked weirdly familiar. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 028713 \nThe group had a chance to visit with \nBashar Masri, the Nablus-born founder and \nCEO of Massar International, the \nPalestinian conglomerate financing a third \nof Rawabi. Massar and Qatar Diar, the real \nestate investment arm of the government of \nQatar's sovereign wealth fund, jointly \ncreated Bayti Real Estate Investment \nCompany -- Palestine to build and market \nRawabi. But if two-thirds of the project's \nmoney is coming from Qatar, the vision \nbehind Rawabi is Masri's. \nMassar owns a private equity fund that \ninvests in Palestinian agriculture and \nnatural gas distribution. It runs travel \nagencies in Jordan and brokerage firms in \nSerbia. Massar invests in Harvest Export, \nwhich sells Palestinian produce to \nconsumers in Russia and Western Europe --\nas well as in Israel. Two years ago, Masri \nmade headlines when he attempted to  \npurchase a bankrupt Jewish housing \ndevelopment in East Jerusalem. He helped \ncreate an online trading and brokerage \nplatform for Palestine's stock exchange. \nMasri has lived outside of Palestine for \nperiods of his life, and is, by all accounts, \nlargely untainted by connections to the \nPA's notoriously rent-seeking inner circle. \nHe's a trim middle-aged man, smartly-\ndressed, friendly and approachable. There \nseemed no more appropriate a place to talk \nto him one-on-one than on a wide terrace \noverlooking the construction site, with \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 028714 \nhills, valleys, and rising apartment blocks --\nthe future he was in the process of building \n-- stretched out in front of him. \n\"On a good, clear day, you can see Tel \nAviv, Ashdod, and Ashkelon,\" he told me. \n\"One-third of Palestine and Israel.\" Rawabi \nis in the second-largest, yet most sparsely-\npopulated Area A in the West Bank -- from \nthe terrace, which faces away from Ateret, \nyou can see expanses of mostly-empty \nhills. Perhaps in Masri's mind, they are \nawaiting Rawabis of their own. When I \nreturned to Washington, I asked him in a \nphone interview if he viewed his project as \nthe first of many such planned cities in \nPalestine. \"I always say our success is \nmeasured not by how many homes we sell. \nIt is measured when a second Rawabi is \nestablished,\" he told me. \nStanding on the terrace, I asked him if his \nwillingness to undertake such a massive \nproject reflected any optimism about the \ncoming years -- no one invests this much \ntime, money, and energy into something if \nthey expect war is on the horizon. \"This \nproject is built for today's politics,\" he \nreplied. \"If it gets a little worse, or a little \nbetter -- fine. If it gets really bad, we're in \ntrouble. If it doesn't, then great. We're not \nwaiting on a breakthrough.\" \nHe estimated that Israeli obstruction had \ndelayed the project by a year and a half \nThe bureaucratic inertia could continue: \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 028715 \nFor instance, developers were surprised to \nfind out that, by a quirk in the West Bank's \nnotoriously Byzantine and palimpsestic \nlegal codes, they required the approval of a \njoint Israeli-Palestinian water commission \ncreated through the Oslo Accords to build a \nsewage treatment plant in an Area A, \napproval that they recently received. \nThere's also the still-unresolved matter of \nthe access road. But thus far, Rawabi had \nflourished in spite of delays and \ninconveniences. \nCould it survive its isolation, though --\ncould this hilltop off of a two-lane highway \nget enough water and electricity to support \n45,000 people living at a middle class \nstandard? \"There is nothing here at all. \nWe're out in the boondocks,\" he conceded. \n\"We're building everything from scratch.\" \nOne needed only to glance at the busy \nconstruction site below to understand that \nMasri considers this a point of pride, far \nfrom a potential death-sentence for his \nproject. \nI asked Masri about something that had \njumped out at me during the 3-D video. \nThe finished Rawabi, I'd noted, had the \nsame terraced garden parks, stoic, modular \napartment design, and concentric hilltop \nroads that I had seen in Talpiyot Misrach, a \nnew neighborhood on the fringes of West \nJerusalem. His city looked very, well, \nIsraeli. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 028716 \n\"This place is influenced by Reston, \nVirginia,\" he said -- Masri is a Virginia \nTech alumnus, and had lived in the \nWashington, DC area earlier in life. It was, \nhe said, influenced by planned suburbs \noutside of Cairo. \"And it's influenced by \nModi'in,\" he added, explaining that the \nsite's engineers and designers (who were \nentirely Palestinian, we had been told \nearlier), had traveled to the Israeli city, \nwhich is built around similar topography, \nfor inspiration. \nPalestinians have long understood that a \nwestern-style standard of living was \npossible in their part of the world. They \nknew that places like Rawabi already \nexisted minutes from their own homes, but \ndidn't think that the quality of life \nepitomized by hilltop settlements and cities \nin Israel -- places they weren't allowed to \nvisit without an official permit from the \nmilitary -- was accessible to them. \nDuring our phone interview, Masri talked \nabout the astonishment that Palestinians \nfeel when they visit the construction site. \n\"When [Palestinians] come to Rawabi, and \nthey go through the showroom and they see \nwhat we have planned for them, and they \nsee it actually being built, they say, 'Wow, \nthis can't be for us. This is not for us. This \nis too high of a standard for us because we \nare supposed to live miserably under the \noccupation'. Then they come to the other \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 028717 \nside of the showroom and see the city being \nbuilt, and reality starts sinking in.\" \nIt's a type of living closely associated with \nthe Palestinians' neighbors in Israel. \"They \nknow very well that just a 20-minute drive \naway, there's a community with a much \nhigher standard of living. And that \ncommunity happened to be one \nrepresenting the occupier, quote-unquote \nthe 'enemy.' But they would love to live \nlike that. And that's why when they come \nto Rawabi some of them don't believe this \nis for them initially. The first thing that \ngoes through their mind is that this could \nbe for the Israelis.\" \nBut it is for them. Rawabi's significance \ncould lie in something more mundane than \nbasic issues of sovereignty and control in \nthe West Bank. It lies in the common, \nhuman desire -- powerful on either side of \nthe Green Line -- for a comfortable and \ndignified existence. \nIn some quarters, this idea of working \nwithin the present and less-than-ideal \npolitical and economic framework to \nachieve this goal is nothing short of \ninflammatory. The U.S.-based, anti-peace \nprocess website Electronic Intifada has \nsmeared Masri as an Israeli collaborator, \nand there have been scattered accusations \nthat the project actually legitimizes Israeli \ncontrol over the West Bank. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 028718 \nDanin says that Masri is faced with a \ndifficult balancing act. \"On the one hand \nyou're denying the occupation, and you're \nsaying you do not accept its legitimacy,\" he \nsays. \"But that doesn't mean you won't \nwork with Israel in order to improve the \nPalestinian situation with the goal of \nremoving the occupation. That's a difficult \nmessage to convey successfully.\" \nMasri rejects the notion that he abetting a \nproblematic status quo. \"The vast majority \nof Palestinians understand and know \nreality,\" he said. \"There is no home in \nPalestine without Israeli cement and parts. \nEvery construction project in Palestine \nmust have components from Israel. So it's \nnot like I'm doing something different.\" \nOf course, he doesn't like that Israel has so \nmuch control over Palestinian imports, and \nthe West Bank economy in general. \"This \nis the occupation,\" he said. \"I'm not happy \nabout that and that's why we strive for a \nstate of our own.\" But he likened \nboycotting Israeli products to boycotting \nproducts from the United Kingdom, the \nUnited States, or other countries supportive \nof Israel -- something he wouldn't consider. \nThe only people he won't buy from are the \nWest Bank settlers. \nLuckily, Masri's vision has the backing of a \npowerful regional government -- one that \ndoes not officially recognize Israel, and \nwhose actions have often had the effect of \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 028719 \nstrengthening some of the Jewish State's \nsworn enemies. \nThe Gulf kingdom of Qatar has done more \nthan simply buy into the Rawabi paradigm: \nIt's also funding two-thirds of the project, \nto the tune of over $600 million. This is \nenough money to single-handedly finance \nthe Fatah-dominated Palestinian Authority \n-- which is effectively broke, thanks to \npenalties imposed by the Israeli and U.S. \ngovernments after Mahmoud Abbas's \nsuccessful push for a U.N. General \nAssembly vote on Palestinian U.N. \nmembership, and a freeze in financial aid \nfrom Gulf State donors, most notably Saudi \nArabia -- for the better part of a year. \nInstead, the Qataris have not only bypassed \nthe PA, but channeled money into a project \nthat seems to prove the PA's uselessness. \n\"It's like an island inside the traditional \ninfrastructure of the PA,\" says Jonathan \nSchanzer, vice president of research at the \nFoundation for Defense of Democracies \nand author of a book on Palestinian internal \npolitics. \"It shows everyone what you can \ndo if you don't go through the PA. The PA \nreceives $600 million a year [in foreign \naid] and they have not done something like \nthis.\" \nMasri says that the leadership of the PA has \nbeen fully supportive, but that Rawabi has \nbeen hurt by the Palestinian government's \nlack of capacity. \"We should not be \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 028720 \nbuilding public schools. We should not be \nbuilding a waste water treatment plant or \nwaste water networks or water reservoirs,\" \nhe told me. \"Unfortunately we have to do \nthat because the Palestinian Authority does \nnot have the funding and the donors let [the \nPA] down.\" \nThere might be a political calculation \nbehind Qatar's decision to throw an amount \nof money equivalent to two years of U.S.  \nfinancial aid to the PA behind a single \nprivate-sector figure like Masri. Qatar \nrecently announced plans to invest nearly  \n$400 million in the Hamas-controlled Gaza \nStrip, and in October of 2012, Qatari Emir \nSheikh Hamad bin Khalifa al-Thani \nbecame the first head of state to visit the  \nStrip  after the Islamist militant group's \n2007 takeover. Hamas politburo chief \nKhaled Meshaal lives in Doha, and Qatar \nDiar is financing a major development in  \nSudan, whose cash-strapped government \nenjoys close relations with Iran, and has \nfacilitated the transfer of long-range \nrockets to Hamas. In short, Qatar supports \nan E.U. and U.S. listed terrorist \norganization bitterly opposed to both Israel \nand the current PA leadership. And it also \nhas no problem investing in Rawabi. \nAccording to Kamran Bokhari, vice \npresident of Middle Eastern and South \nAsian affairs for Stratfor, Qatari support for \nHamas is part of the sheikhdom's larger, \npost-Arab Spring strategy of siding with \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 028721 \nthe Middle East's Islamists, and specifically \nthe Muslim brotherhood, whom the Qataris \nview as the region's rising power. \"The \nQatari strategy is that the situation has \nchanged, and we need to fend for ourselves \nand ensure that the regional anarchy is not \ngoing to impact us,\" says Bokhari. The \nQatari investment in Rawabi -- which feeds \nan $85 million investment in the Israeli \neconomy, and which could not have \nhappened without some degree of official \nIsraeli approval -- is an example of this \nlarger geopolitical strategy, which is driven \nmore by perceived self-interest than by an \nideological affinity for political Islam. \n\"Investments in the region are about the \nreturn on political influence,\" adds Gregory \nGause, a professor at the University of \nVermont and a non-resident senior fellow \nat the Brookings Institution-Doha. He \nnoted the presence of a large American \nairbase in Qatar, and the country's close \nrelations with the United States. \nIn the Palestinian territories, as in the \nbroader region, the Qataris are supporting \nsecular and religious forces in a way that \nwill maximize their influence and keep the \nregional balance as favorable for them as \npossible. In a sense, the same strategic \ncalculus that convinces Qatar to support \nHamas allows them to cooperate with Israel \nand the West Bank private sector as well. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 028722 \n\"I think Qatar is going by the ground \nreality,\" says Bokhari. \"Fatah, the ruling \nfaction of the PA, is essentially tanking. It's \nreally in a state of decline because of \ncorruption and charges of embezzlement. \nIt's got an aging leadership. There's no \ndynamism left in the group. There's a lot of \nfactionalism. It's almost like an oligarchy.\" \nRawabi could be Qatar's way of \nencouraging the currently-calm status quo \nin the West Bank, but without obviously \nupgrading their ties to Israel, or throwing \ntheir money behind a political \nestablishment that they don't fully trust. \n\"On one end they need to make sure Fatah \ndoes not completely collapse or weaken to \nthe point where they're no longer coherent,\" \nsays Bokhari, \"and Hamas needs to be \nshaped and contained and shepherded in a \nway that it doesn't grow into anything \nlarger.\" \nThough there are politics underlying \nQatar's investment in Rawabi, it is still, \ninevitably, a financial decision. \"You have \nserious people who have a lot at risk here,\" \nDanin says. \"Their goal is not primarily to \nmake a political point. Their goal is to \nrecoup their investment and make some \nmoney.\" Even resource-rich Qatar, which \nwants to diversity its holdings in order to \nhedge against long-term shifts in the oil \nand natural gas market, cares whether its \ninvestment choices pay off \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 028723 \nDanin believes that Rawabi's Palestinian \nand Qatari investors made a wise decision. \nHousing in Ramallah is expensive, and \nDanin says that there is a sizable and \nhighly-educated Palestinian middle class in \nneed of an alternative to the West Bank's \nde-facto capital. He expressed little doubt \nwhen I asked him if the West Bank \neconomy could support Rawabi. \"This is a \nPalestinian national project,\" he said. \"It is \nthe best of what is possible in that it's \nprivate sector-led, and it's profit-making \nled.\" \nAnd it has supporters in high places. When \nPresident Barack Obama met with Israeli \nofficials in Washington in September of \n2010, Rawabi was on the agenda. \nFrom one perspective, Rawabi is a historic \ninvestment in Palestine, as well as an \nunusually open point of cooperation \nbetween Israel and an Arab government. It \ncould improve the lives of Palestinians, \nwhile convincing Israelis that they have \nnothing to fear from their neighbors' \nprosperity. But any attempts to change \nthe status quo in the West Bank are fraught \nwith difficulties. \nThere's Israeli bureaucracy to overcome. \n\"In Israel, if the Minister of Defense says I \nwant something, it's not that the system \nthwarts it. But the system is so \ndecentralized that ultimately it takes a lot \nof steps to get it translated into action,\" \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 028724 \nsays Danin. Israeli officials are positively \ndisposed towards Rawabi, but it's still taken \nyears to resolve sovereignty and \ngovernance issues around necessities like \nwater, and a single access road. Such \nIsraeli inertia was apparently at the heart of \nObama's concerns back in 2010, and \nsources say that the president has discussed \nthe issue of the access road with Israeli \nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on \nmultiple occasions. \nBack in Washington, I asked Masri if he \nbelieved the Israelis understood the \npotential importance of Rawabi. \"I really \ndon't know,\" he said. \"Their statements are \nneutral to positive. But their actions are \nneutral to negative.\" \nAnd then there's the larger inertia. What \nmeaning does a place like Rawabi have if it \nsits in the middle of a still-unresolved \nconflict, or if Palestinian economic self-\nimprovement stands in contrast to an all-\npervading political stasis -- or even \npolitical backsliding? Today, Rawabi is \nsignificant because of its novelty. But if \nthere's a breakthrough in the Israeli-\nPalestinian peace process, perhaps enabled \nby a growing West Bank economy and a \npermanent end in terrorism, it could take on \nan importance much larger than itself \nOn the drive out of the valley, where the \nhighway swerves past the pillbox with the \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 028725 \nbeaten Israeli flag and past the turnoff for \nAteret, the picture is still mixed. \nArmin Rosen writes for and produces The \nAtlantic's International Channel. \n',11:4142, \nClick here to Reply or Forward \nWhy this ad?Ads — \nTeach English Worldwide  \nBecome an English Teacher Overseas Earn Your TESOL Online \nat USC. \nrossieronline.usc.edu \n22.3 GB (10%) of 210.1 GBManage  \n©2013 Google - Terms & Privacy \nLast account activity: 0 minutes ago \nDetails \nTeach English Worldwide \n*********************************************************** \nThe information contained in this communication is \nconfidential, may be attorney-client privileged, may \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 028726 \nconstitute inside information, and is intended only for \nthe use of the addressee.

If a limited number of prototypes cost $10 per piece to\nmanufacture and sell for $11 each, that’s fine for the initial testing period, and essential for limiting\ndownside. Sacrifice margin temporarily for the testing phase, if need be, and avoid potentially fatal\nupfront overcommitments.\n\n8. Negotiate Late— Make Others Negotiate Against Themselves\n\nNever make a first offer when purchasing. Flinch after the first offer (“$3,000!” followed by pure silence,\nwhich uncomfortable salespeople fill by dropping the price once), let people negotiate against themselves\n(“Is that really the best you can offer?” elicits at least one additional drop in price), then “bracket.” If\nthey end up at $2,000 and you want to pay $1,500, offer $1,250. They’ll counter with approximately\n$1,750, to which you respond: “I'll tell you what—let’s just split the difference. I'll overnight FedEx you\na check, and we can call it a day.” The end result? Exactly what you wanted: $1,500.\n\n9. Hyperactivity vs. Productivity — 80/20 and Pareto’s Law\n\nBeing busy is not the same as being productive. Forget about the start-up overwork ethic that people\nwear as a badge of honor— get analytical. The 80/20 principle, also known as Pareto’s Law, dictates that\n80% of your desired outcomes are the result of 20% of your activities or inputs. Once per week, stop\nputting out fires for an afternoon and run the numbers to ensure you’re placing effort in high-yield areas:\nWhat 20% of customers/products/ regions are producing 80% of the profit?) What are the factors that\ncould account for this? Invest in duplicating your few strong areas instead of fixing all of your\nweaknesses.\n\n10. The Customer Is Not Always Right—‘‘Fire” High-Maintenance Customers\n\nNot all customers are created equal. Apply the 80/20 principle to time consumption: What 20% of people\nare consuming 80% of your time? Put high-maintenance, low-profit customers on autopilot— process\norders but don’t pursue them or check up on them—and “fire” high-maintenance, high-profit customers\nby sending a memo detailing how a change in business model requires a few new policies: how often and\nhow to communicate, standardized pricing and order process, etc. Indicate that, for those clients whose\nneeds are incompatible with these new policies, you are happy to introduce other providers. “But what if\nmy largest customer consumes all of my time?” Recognize that (1) without time, you cannot scale your\ncompany (and, oftentimes, life) beyond that customer, and (2) people, even good people, will\nunknowingly abuse your time to the extent that you let them. Set good rules for all involved to minimize\nback-and-forth and meaningless communication.\n\n11. Deadlines Over Details—Test Reliability Before Capability\n\nSkills are overrated. Perfect products delivered past deadline kill companies faster than decent products\ndelivered on time. Test someone’s ability to deliver on a specific and tight deadline before hiring them\nbased on a dazzling portfolio. Products can be fixed as long as you have cash flow, and bugs are\nforgiven, but missing deadlines is often fatal. Calvin Coolidge once said that nothing is more common\nthan unsuccessful men with talent; I would add that the second most common is smart people who think\ntheir IQ or resume justifies delivering late. —JUNE 24, 2008\n\nThe Holy Grail: How to Outsource the Inbox and Never Check E-\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_014005\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

I’m not going to be in the\nposition of making the same mistakes.” He nodded, and didn’t raise it again.\n\nIn fact, it was under Shamir that I began to get more involved with political\nand policy issues beyond the armed forces. Part of this came with the job of\nRosh Aman. There was hardly a major domestic or foreign challenge that did\nnot have some security component, and no security matter on which intelligence\nwas not critical. But I also found myself working more closely with leading\npoliticians: mainly Shamir and Misha Arens, who as defense minister was my\nmain point of contact. Since I was a Labor kibbutznik, we made an odd\nthreesome. Arens was also a lifelong Jabotinsky Zionist. He had been in the\nBetar youth movement in America, before going to Palestine in 1948 and\njoining the Irgun. In fact, it was with Misha’s personal backing that one of my\nformer Sayeret Matkal officers — the son of a Jabotinsky acolyte — had recently\ntaken his first steps into the political limelight. After a two-year stint as Israel’s\nnumber-two diplomat in Washington, Bibi Netanyahu had become our\nambassador to the United Nations.\n\nWith both Arens and Shamir, I built a solid relationship, based on mutual\nrespect, and it would deepen further when I moved on to a wider role in the\nkirya a few years later. They were straight talkers. While resolute about\ndecisions once they’d taken them, they were genuinely open to discussion and\ndebate. I also sometimes found a surprising degree of nuance behind their tough\nexterior.\n\nThe toughness was there, however. One of the first major security crises we\nfaced after Shamir became Prime Minister was known as the Kav 300 affair,\nnamed for the bus route between the southern port city of Ashdod and Tel Aviv.\nOn the evening of April 12, 1984, four Palestinians from Gaza boarded the bus\nand hijacked it back toward the border with Egypt. They told the passengers they\nwere armed with knives, and that a suitcase which one of them was carrying\ncontained unexploded anti-tank shells. After a high-speed chase, an Israeli army\nunit managed to shoot out the tires and disable the vehicle, when it was still\nabout ten miles short of Gaza. One of the passengers had been severely injured at\n\n213\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_028061\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

There are clearly gray areas in which the man ought to resolve doubts in favor of not\nacting and where the law ought to resolve doubts in favor of not convicting.\n\nI have represented several clients who fit this situation. One such case was a highly publicized\nprosecution of three prominent doctors and a nurse at one of Boston’s leading hospitals.\n\nOne of the doctors had a party at his house for some of the hospital staff. During the party, the\nnurse danced with several of the doctors and two of them “fooled around” with her in the\nbathroom. As the party was ending, the three doctors invited the nurse to join them for a drive to\nRockport where one of the doctors had a vacation home. She went along with them because in\nher words, she thought they were just “horsing around.”\n\nWhen they arrived at the Rockport home, two of the doctors smoked marijuana and all of three of\nthem began to disrobe. She said she protested and told them to stop when the three of them\nbegan to undress her. Each of the defendants then had sex with the nurse in the bedroom. She\ntestified that she felt physically numbed and could not resist.\n\nSometime later, they drove back to Boston and stopped to view the beach, to have breakfast and\nfill the car up with gasoline. One of the doctors gave her his card and said he would be interested\nin hooking up with her again. The defendants each testified that the sexual intercourse was\nentirely consensual, that it was she who took her dress off and that she appeared at all times to be\na willing participant.\n\nThe issue in the case was what the jury should do if they believe both the nurse and the\ndoctors—that is, if they thought that the nurse did not want to have sex with the three doctors,\nbut if the doctors believed that she was a willing participant.\n\nThe jury convicted the defendants and the judge sentenced them to six months imprisonment\nobviously suggesting that he had some doubts about the sufficiency of the case. I was asked to\nconsult on the appeal. I accepted the assignment because I wanted to preserve the mistake of fact\ndefense in the face of efforts to abolish it in rape cases.\n\nUnfortunately for these defendants their trial lawyers had not appropriately raised the issue of\nreasonable mistake of fact. They asked for an instruction that might have invited the jury to\nacquit even if the mistake had been unreasonable—that is, even if the doctors believed that “no”\nmeant “yes.” The appellate court ruled, therefore, “We need not reach the issue whether a\nreasonable and honest mistake to the fact of consent would be a defense, for even if we assume it\nto be so, the defendants did not request a jury instruction based on a reasonable mistake of fact.\nWe are aware of no American court of last resort that recognizes mistake of fact, without\nconsideration of its reasonableness.”\n\nIn a subsequent case, in which I was not involved, a Massachusetts Appellate Court ruled that\neven a reasonable mistake of fact is not a defense when it comes to consent or lack of consent in\nthe context of a rape prosecution.\n\n256\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_017343\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

In\naddition to Dan and me, it included key members of the general staff and senior\ndefense ministry officials. The idea was for us to hear a half-dozen academics\nand other specialists speak about the political aspects of the sudden eruption of\nPalestinian violence.\n\nThough he spoke for barely 10 minutes, it was the last speaker who left the\ndeepest impression. Shimon Shamir, a professor at Tel Aviv University, began\nby emphasizing he was not an expert in riot control. Finding a response to the\nviolence was something we were far better equipped to do. But then he paused,\nlooked intently at Rabin, Dan and me, and said: “What I can do is draw on\nhistory.” One by one, he cited examples of more than a dozen broadly similar\nrebellions over the past century, in the Middle East and beyond. “If we were\ndealing with simple rioting, things might be different.” But he said the\nPalestinians were, fundamentally, acting out of a shared sense of grievance, and\nshared national identity. Both were in large part the result of Israel having\ncontrolled their daily lives now for more than two decades. “I’m afraid I can\nfind no historical precedent for the successful suppression of the national will of\na people,” he said. Even when those in power used unimaginably punitive tools:\nlike expulsion, or forced starvation. “Even, as we know well as a Jewish people,\nextermination.”\n\nI glanced at Yitzhak and at Dan. Both of them looked like I felt: in no doubt\nthe professor was right, yet also aware that, in the short term, we still had to find\na way of putting a lid on the cauldron and keeping the situation for getting\nirretrievably out of control.\n\nIt wasn’t as if ’'d been unaware of the sense of the anger building among\nmany West Bank and Gaza Palestinians, or of their wish to see an end to Israel’s\nmilitary administration and the growing number of Jewish settlements. From\nmy time as head of the central command, I also knew that there was a young,\nactivist core intensifying efforts to organize attacks on troops and settlers. But\nnone of us had any inkling that something of the scale, longevity and political\ncomplexity of the intfada lay ahead.\n\nPartly, this was a failure of specific intelligence warnings. But it went deeper\nthan that. Sobering though it was, I had to accept that — no less so than before\nthe Yom Kippur War in 1973 — I and many others had for too long been\ncomforting ourselves with a fundamental misconception about our military\noccupation and civilian settlement in the areas captured in 1967.

But Masters’ audience was\nobviously expecting something different and, presented with this level\nof complexity, went into shutdown. Perhaps they wanted a simpler\npresentation, a high-level summary, a few bullet points. Of course, there\nis no simple presentation on Afghanistan. The lesson is that context,\ntiming and expectation are often as important to good communication\nas the elegance of the content, and that information is a complex thing.\n\nIf you want a lighthearted poke at PowerPoint here is Peter Norvig’s\nPowerPoint version of the Gettysburg Address.\n\nUnderstanding\n\nNext time you are in a business meeting, count the number of times the\nword ‘understand is used. If you ask the people around you what it means\nyou'll stump many of them. That’s because understanding has two very\ndifferent meanings. Most people don’t separate these meanings but the\ndistinction is important. Understanding means to decode information,\nto comprehend — but, more importantly, it also means to absorb and\ninternalize information. That feeling you have when you ‘et it’\n\nIf I say, “I understand” I mean I have taken in the question you\nasked and decoded it into ideas so I can provide an answer. This can be\nquite a mechanical process and computers routinely understand natural\nlanguage and answer questions — Apple's digital assistant Siri being a\ncase in point.\n\nWhen I say, “I understand a problem” or “understand a culture”\nI mean something far less tangible. Somehow the information I have\ngathered over my life is formed into a matrix within my brain that allows\nme to ponder and run scenarios. I can predict the effects of my actions\nbefore I do them, and often anticipate your responses. That’s clearly\na very useful evolutionary adaption, but is there more to it than that?\nRoger Penrose and David Deutsch think understanding allows us to\ntransfer non-symbolic information from one brain to another. We don't\nrun programs in our brains, nor do we store precise information such as\nlists and tables. We have, therefore, had to evolve a creative approach to\ncommunicating skills and understanding each other. One of the most\nclosely studied areas in the field of communication is when it breaks\ndown in the lead up to a disaster.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_015746\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

What I would do if I were his lawyer is to say,\n“Look, the dignity of the office precludes the [President from\nanswering any of these questions. We realize that as a result of not\nanswering these questions, we will reluctantly, without admitting\nanything, have to be sanctioned by having the verdict directed\nagainst us on the merits. We accept that because we can’t answer\nthe questions and preserve the dignity. And now let’s move on to\nthe damages, where the focus is not on the [P]resident but on Paula\nJones.” And in that way, he can, in effect, settle the case, even if\nthe other side doesn’t settle because the damages will be very low,\nthere won’t be an apology. There’ll be a judgment against him, but\nthe judgment will be explained on the basis of the dignity of the\npresidency. So if the settlement talks fail, that’s what I would\nrecommend that his lawyers think about. . . .\n\nAnd the [P]resident has to start asking himself: Is he well advised\nhere?\n\nThe President had three options, but he was aware of only two of them. He knew that he could\nlitigate and try to win — as he ended up doing. He also knew that he could try to settle the case,\nwhich would have avoided the necessity of testifying at the deposition or trial. A settlement\nrequires both sides to agree. In the Jones case, the president reportedly offered to pay Jones\n$700,000, in order to settle the case. Jones insisted on an apology® and the settlement talks\neventually broke down.\n\nThe third option, of which the president was unaware, was to default the Jones case. Every\nlitigant in a civil case has the right to default — which means, essentially, to settle the case\nunilaterally by simply refusing to contest the allegations in the complaint. Consider, for example,\nthe following hypothetical case: a fired employee of a high tech business sues for $10,000 in back\npay. The business realizes that in order to defend its actions, it would have to reveal commercial\nsecrets valued at $1,000,000 and take the time of executives which it estimates at being worth\n$200,000. It offers to settle the case for the $10,000 that the employee is demanding, but the\nangry employee prefers a trial at which he will be publicly vindicated. The company has the right\nsimply to default, have the judgment entered against it, and have the court order it to the pay the\ndamages sought by the employee. No stigma is attached to defaulting a case. It does not even\nnecessarily entail an admission of liability. It represents a practical assessment of the costs and\nbenefits of litigating and not litigating — just as a settlement does.\n\nRobert Bennett never told President Clinton that he could have defaulted and paid Jones without\nmaking any apology. Perhaps the Lewinsky story would have leaked, but the President would not\nhave had to dignify a rumor with a response. It was the entirely avoidable decision to have him\n\n%° Paula Jones’ lawyer have subsequently revealed that the Jones lawsuit could have been settled at one point for no\nmoney with just a simple apology from President Clinton which made it clear that Paula Jones did not do anything\nwrong in the hotel room.\n\n270\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_017357\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

Since I try to prepare my students to be lawyers over their entire careers, and\nsince the career of a lawyer now extends to a full half century, I must always think ahead to what\nour legal system will look like when my current students end their careers.\n\nI could not have asked more or better from my first half century. I have accomplished far more\nthan I could ever have anticipated, especially in light of my undistinguished elementary and high\nschool performance, and I have lived a more interesting life than I could ever have dreamed. I\nhave surely lived the passion of my times and I’ve been very lucky, at least so far. (I don’t want\nto give myself a “kneina hura.”!’) Like the fictional Zelig in Woody Allen’s great film of that\nname, I was privileged to have been present—literally or virtually—at many of the most important\nlegal and political events that transpired during my adult life. For some I volunteered, for others I\nwas solicited. Sometimes I was a direct participant, other times an active observer and reporter.\nIn this “closing argument” I will try to summarize my role in the important legal and political\ndevelopments in which I participated. I will also speculate about what the future may hold for our\nsystem of laws and justice.\n\nOliver Wendell Holmes, Jr. viewed the role of the lawyer as a predictor of future legal decisions\nand trends.’’” But the Talmud cautioned that prophecy ended with the destruction of the second\ntemple and that he/she who tries to prophecy the future is either a fool or a naive. Or asa\ncontemporary sage—Y ogi Berra—put it: “Prediction is very hard, especially about the future.” I\ncertainly agree that prognosticating the future is a daunting challenge, but lawyers and law\nprofessors must confront that challenge, because one of the most important jobs we have is to\nidentify trends and to anticipate significant developments, I will try, therefore, with these cautions\nin mind, to extrapolate about what a lawyer writing an autobiography 50 years from now might\nlook back at and write about.\n\nBefore I summarize my past and speculate about the future, let me say a word about my present\nlife. I remain extremely active in every phase of my career. Here is a summary of the week\nduring which I wrote these words. The week of November 13 through November 20, 2011 was\nfairly typical of my life during my 74\" year.!\"!\n\nOn Sunday morning I was picked up by limo and taken to Bedford airport where I boarded a\nprivate 747 jet owned by Sheldon Adelson, reputed to be the richest Jew in history and among the\nhandful of wealthiest Americans. The son of a Boston cab driver, Adelson has accumulated\nbillions of dollars by building and running casinos in Las Vegas, Micow and Singapore.

Mohammed Jamal Khalife, Osama bin Laden's close friend and, while in the Philippines, financier\nof both Ramzi Yousef (principal architect of the first World Trade Center [WTC] attack) and his uncle\nKhalid Sheikh Mohammed;\n\n3.

Khalid al-Mihdhar and Nawaf al-Hazmi, two of the alleged 9/11 hijackers, whose presence in the\nUnited States was concealed from the FBI by CIA officers for months before 9/11.\n\nIt might sound from these citations that the 9/11 Commission marked a new stage in the U.S.\ntreatment of these terrorists, and that the report now exposed those terrorists who in the past had\nbeen protected. On the contrary, a principal purpose of my chapter is to show that\n\n1. one purpose of protecting these individuals had been to protect a valued intelligence connection\n(the \"al-Qaeda connection,” if you will);\n\n2. one major intention of the 9/11 Commission Report was to continue protecting this connection;\n\n3. those on the 9/11 Commission staff who were charged with this protection included at least one\ncommission member (Jamie Gorelick), one staff member (Dietrich Snell), and one important witness\n(Patrick Fitzgerald) who earlier had figured among the terrorists’ protectors.\n\nIn the course of writing this chapter [Scott continues], | came to another disturbing conclusion | had\nnot anticipated. This is that a central feature of the protection has been to defend the 9/11\nCommission’s false picture of al-Qaeda as an example of non-state terrorism, ignoring not just the\nCIA but also the royal families of Saudi Arabia and Qatar. In reality, as | shall show, royal family\nprotection from Qatar and Saudi Arabia (concealed by the 9/11 Commission) was repeatedly given\nto key figures like Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, the alleged “principal architect of the 9/11 attacks.” The\nestablishment claims that the wars fought by America in Asia since 9/11 have been part of a global\n“war on terror.” But this “war on terror” has been fought in alliance with Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and\nPakistan - precisely the principal political and financial backers of the al-Qaedist networks the United\nStates has supposedly been fighting. Meanwhile the most authentic opponents in the region of these\nSunni al-Qaedists - the governments of Iraq, Libya, Syria, and Iran - have found themselves\noverthrown (in the case of Iraq and Libya), subverted with U.S. support (in the case of Syria), or\nsanctioned and threatened as part of an “axis of evil” (in the case of Iran).

Months earlier, the stepmother of a 14-year-old girl told the\nPalm Beach police that a wealthy older man, whom the girl later identified as Mr.\nEpstein, might have had inappropriate sexual contact with her.\n\nIn sworn statements to the police, the 14-year-old and other teenage girls said a friend\nhad arranged for them to visit Mr. Epstein’s home and give him massages, usually in\ntheir underwear, in exchange for cash.\n\nMost of the girls, according to the police, said Mr. Epstein had masturbated during the\nmassages, and a few said he had penetrated them with his fingers or penis. They\nidentified him in photos and accurately described the inside of his home. Some recalled\nthat his employees had fed them snacks or rented them cars.\n\nMr. Epstein pleaded not guilty in August to the crime he was ultimately charged with,\nsoliciting prostitution. But at a time when prosecutors around the nation have become\nincreasingly severe in dealing with people accused of sex offenses, the case has raised\nquestions about whether Mr. Epstein’s prominence won him preferential treatment.\n\nBy the account of the police, they found probable cause to charge Mr. Epstein with much\nmore serious offenses: one count of lewd and lascivious molestation and four counts of\nunlawful sexual activity with a minor.\n\nBut instead of proceeding with such charges on his own, the Palm Beach County state\nattorney took the rare step of presenting a broad range of possible charges to a grand jury,\nwhich indicted Mr. Epstein in July on the lesser count. In Florida, prosecutors usually\nrefer only capital cases to grand juries.\n\nEven before the indictment, the Palm Beach police chief, Michael Reiter, had accused\nprosecutors of giving Mr. Epstein special treatment and asked the state attorney, Barry E.\nKrischer, to remove himself from the case.\n\nIn an editorial, The Palm Beach Post attacked Mr. Krischer, a Democrat whose post is\nelective, saying the public had been left “to wonder whether the system tilted in favor of\na wealthy, well-connected alleged perpetrator and against very young girls who are\nalleged victims of sex crimes.”\n\nThe case has taken a toll on the reputation of Mr. Epstein, who owns a palatial home in\nManhattan, has pledged $30 million to Harvard and once flew former President Bill\nClinton on his 727. Politicians including Eliot Spitzer, a Democratic candidate for\ngovernor in New York, and Gov. Bill Richardson of New Mexico, also a Democrat, have\nreturned campaign contributions from him.\n\nBut Mr. Epstein fought back, assembling a team of star lawyers, including Gerald B.\nLefcourt and Alan M. Dershowitz, a friend of his, to look into the backgrounds of his\nyoung accusers.\n\nMr. Lefcourt says that the police acted “outrageously” and that his client has been\nwrongfully dragged through the mud.\n\n“He disputes that he ever had sex with any under-age person or anything like that,” said\nMr. Lefcourt, whose clients have included Russell Crowe, Martha Stewart and Abbie\nHoffman.\n\nNeither the police nor the state attorney’s office would discuss the case in detail.

When he left Epstein’s employ, Rodriguez took away some notes and emails about massage\nappointments as “protection” against his own prosecution, and failed to produce them during the Palm\nBeach Police Department’s initial investigation.\n\ne javascript: ;javascript:;\n\ne http://www.thedailybeast.com/blogs- and-stories/2010-07-22/jeffrey-epstein-pedophile-billionaire-and-his-sex-den/full/\ne javascript:void(0)\n\n° javasenpivord(0)\n\ne javascript:void(0)\nUnable to get work as a house manager elsewhere in South Florida, he says, Rodriguez later tried to sell\nthis “golden nugget”—his term—for $50,000, to be used in the victims’ civil suits. Unfortunately, he\nmade the offer to an undercover cop, and was subsequently charged with “obstruction of official\nproceedings” for withholding information that could have advanced the criminal investigation of\nEpstein—which by that point had been settled in a plea deal. Rodriguez was sentenced to 18 months in\nfederal prison (Epstein was allowed to serve 13 months in the Palm Beach county jail), and now awaits\nan additional sentence on Aug. 24 in federal court in Miami for transporting firearms, another deal he\nsays he made to pay the bills after he lost his job.\nIn a deposition given for the civil suits, Rodriguez testified that he was instructed to always have $2,000\nin cash on hand, so that he could pay both the girls who gave massages and recruiters such as Haley\nRobson who brought them to the house. He also testified that Epstein made large contributions to the\nPalm Beach Police Department, and in return was given PBPD baseball hats to put on the dashboard of\nhis various cars to avoid being stopped or ticketed by local police. Retired Police Chief Michael Reiter,\nin his own deposition, acknowledged that, in addition to earlier donations to the police department\n(which are fairly common in well-heeled Palm Beach), Epstein had recently given the department\n$100,000 for some sophisticated equipment. The police were still researching the purchase when Epstein\ncame under suspicion, and Reiter ordered the money returned. (Guy Frostin, one of Epstein’s local\nattorneys, told police that Epstein also gave $100,000 to the Florida Ballet for massages, because he was\n“very passionate” about massages being “therapeutically and spiritually” beneficial. Yet victims told\npolice they had no massage training.)\nPerhaps most disturbing, in terms of possible sex trafficking, was Epstein’s relationship with Jean Luc\nBrunel, owner of the MC2 modeling agency. According to a complaint filed in the U.S. District Court for\nthe Southern District of Florida, an alleged victim said that Epstein, Maxwell, Brunel, Rodriguez, and\nMarcinkova “deliberately engaged in a pattern of racketeering that involved luring minor children\nthrough MC2, mostly girls under the age of 17, to engage in sexual play for money.” (Which would\namount to trafficking.)\nBrunel is a 50-plus French playboy who was formerly part owner of Karin, a Paris-based modeling\nagency. He lives in New York and South Beach, Florida, and owns 85 percent of MC2, which has offices\nin New York, Miami, and Tel Aviv. (The remaining 15 percent is owned by his partner, Jeff Fuller.)\nBrunel has been observed as a house guest at Epstein’s Palm Beach home and may well have had contact\nwith him also in New York, where Epstein owns a lavish home, and in Paris, where Epstein keeps an\napartment on elegant Ave. Foch.\nCBS reporter Craig Pyes, who investigated Brunel for a 60 Minutes broadcast many years ago, is quoted\nin Michael Gross’ book about the modeling industry, Model: The Ugly Business of Beautiful Women.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_022253\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

Simulation may also\nbe used for this purpose.\n\n— Example: A virtual dog wants to achieve the goal G of getting food, and it knows that\nthe procedure P of begging has been successful at this before, so it seeks a context C\nwhere begging can be expected to get it food. Probably this will be a context involving a\nfriendly person.\n\ne PLN-based goal refinement is used to create new subgoals G to sit on the right hand side\nof instances of the cognitive schematic.\n\n— Example: Given that a virtual dog has a goal of finding food, it may learn a subgoal of\nfollowing other dogs, due to observing that other dogs are often heading toward their\n\nfood.\n\ne Concept formation heuristics are used for choosing G and for fueling goal refinement, but\nespecially for choosing C (via providing new candidates for C). They are also used for\nchoosing P, via a process called “predicate schematization” that turns logical predicates\n(declarative knowledge) into procedures.\n\n— Example: At first a virtual dog may have a hard time predicting which other dogs are\ngoing to be mean to it. But it may eventually observe common features among a number\nof mean dogs, and thus form its own concept of “pit bull,” without anyone ever teaching\nit this concept explicitly.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_013030\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

We were surprised at the market’s unbridled optimism in April*, since the tug-of-war between private sector profits and public sector problems has a long way to go.  We chose the charts on the front page of our 2011 Outlook carefully; they were designed to show that equity markets were priced inexpensively, but were likely to stay that way, given too much stimulus in the East, and ineffective stimulus in the West **.  We expect a modest second half recovery, based primarily on US capital spending increases, easy credit conditions everywhere, and a pick-up in industrial production in Japan.  But the world’s structural problems are weighing on the private sector, and our portfolios are positioned for a single-digit year in credit, equities and hedge funds.\n\n \n\n* The Osama Bin Laden episode marked the equity market peak.  Some commentators saw this event as a basis for further optimism, but unsurprisingly, the positive glow lasted for only around 2.5 hours the subsequent Monday.  According to the Congressional Research Service, over the last decade, the US has spent at least $1.1 trillion in war funding operations, surpassing the constant-dollar cost of the Korean and Vietnam Wars combined.  This highlights the disproportionately large pain that small, non-sovereign entities can inflict in the modern era.\n\n \n\n** So far, the large growth and employment multipliers from deficit spending estimated by Christina Romer (former Chair of the President’s Council of Economic Advisers) have not materialized.  John Taylor and John Cogan from Stanford have been closer to the mark: an initial boost, but then a rapidly fading benefit\n\n \n\nSomething different this week.  I was on the road seeing clients last week, and was asked “what should be done about job growth”.  We are investors and not politicians, so my ideas [a] are not relevant.  However, it seems to me that anyone involved in the jobs debate should be required to read the article below, written after the prior deep US recession (1990-1991).  It’s from George McGovern, one of the most liberal politicians [b] ever to hold office and run for President.   His epiphanies after leaving office and running the Stratford Inn are worth considering as legislators contemplate additional job creation measures, and the broader regulatory environment in which the private sector operates.\n\n \n\n“A Politician's Dream Is a Businessman's Nightmare”, by George McGovern, June 1992 [c]\n\n \n\nWisdom too often never comes, and so one ought not to reject it merely because it comes late.  (Justice Felix Frankfurter).   It's been 11 years since I left the U.S. Senate, after serving 24 years in high public office. After leaving a career in politics, I devoted much of my time to public lectures that took me into every state in the union and much of Europe, Asia, the Middle East and Latin America. \n\n \n\nIn 1988, I invested most of the earnings from this lecture circuit acquiring the leasehold on Connecticut's Stratford Inn. Hotels, inns and restaurants have always held a special fascination for me. The Stratford Inn promised the realization of a longtime dream to own a combination hotel, restaurant and public conference facility--complete with an experienced manager and staff.   In retrospect, I wish I had known more about the hazards and difficulties of such a business, especially during a recession of the kind that hit New England just as I was acquiring the inn's 43-year leasehold.  I also wish that during the years I was in public office, I had had this firsthand experience about the difficulties business people face every day. That knowledge would have made me a better U.S. senator and a more understanding presidential contender.\n\n \n\nToday we are much closer to a general acknowledgment that government must encourage business to expand and grow.  Bill Clinton, Paul Tsongas, Bob Kerrey and others have, I believe, changed the debate of our party [d].  We intuitively know that to create job opportunities we need entrepreneurs who will risk their capital against an expected payoff.   Too often, however, public policy does not consider whether we are choking off those opportunities. \n\n \n\nMy own business perspective has been limited to that small hotel and restaurant in Stratford, Conn., with an especially difficult lease and a severe recession. But my business associates and I also lived with federal, state and local rules that were all passed with the objective of helping employees, protecting the environment, raising tax dollars for schools, protecting our customers from fire hazards, etc. While I never doubted the worthiness of any of these goals, the concept that most often eludes legislators is: `Can we make consumers pay the higher prices for the increased operating costs that accompany public regulation and government reporting requirements with reams of red tape.' It is a simple concern that is nonetheless often ignored by legislators [e].   For example, the papers today are filled with stories about businesses dropping health coverage for employees. We provided a substantial package for our staff at the Stratford Inn. However, were we operating today, those costs would exceed $150,000 a year for health care on top of salaries and other benefits. There would have been no reasonable way for us to absorb or pass on these costs. \n\n \n\nSome of the escalation in the cost of health care is attributed to patients suing doctors. While one cannot assess the merit of all these claims, I've also witnessed firsthand the explosion in blame-shifting and scapegoating for every negative experience in life.   Today, despite bankruptcy, we are still dealing with litigation from individuals who fell in or near our restaurant. Despite these injuries, not every misstep is the fault of someone else. Not every such incident should be viewed as a lawsuit instead of an unfortunate accident. And while the business owner may prevail in the end, the endless exposure to frivolous claims and high legal fees is frightening. \n\n \n\nOur Connecticut hotel, along with many others, went bankrupt for a variety of reasons, the general economy in the Northeast being a significant cause. But that reason masks the variety of other challenges we faced that drive operating costs and financing charges beyond what a small business can handle. It is clear that some businesses have products that can be priced at almost any level. The price of raw materials (e.g., steel and glass) and life-saving drugs and medical care are not easily substituted by consumers. It is only competition or antitrust that tempers price increases. Consumers may delay purchases, but they have little choice when faced with higher prices.   In services, however, consumers do have a choice when faced with higher prices. You may have to stay in a hotel while on vacation, but you can stay fewer days. You can eat in restaurants fewer times per month, or forgo a number of services from car washes to shoeshines. Every such decision eventually results in job losses for someone. And often these are the people without the skills to help themselves--the people I've spent a lifetime trying to help. \n\n \n\nIn short, “one-size-fits-all” rules for business ignore the reality of the market place. And setting thresholds for regulatory guidelines at artificial levels--e.g., 50 employees or more, $500,000 in sales--takes no account of other realities, such as profit margins, labor intensive vs. capital intensive businesses, and local market economics.   The problem we face as legislators is: Where do we set the bar so that it is not too high to clear? I don't have the answer. I do know that we need to start raising these questions more often.\n\n \n\n-----------\n\n \n\nSo, there you have it, one of the more remarkable epiphanies in American politics: a paean to entrepreneurship and government restraint from one of its most progressive members.  Public epiphanies like this are rare, but there have been others.  Last year, Al Gore conceded that first-generation ethanol was “not good policy” given its low energy conversion ratios, and said he had supported ethanol out of “a certain fondness for the farmers in the state of Iowa because I was about to run for president\" [f].  In 2008, former Fed Chair Greenspan conceded that his Ayn Rand philosophies regarding regulations and shareholder self-interest were flawed.  Perhaps the most famous epiphany was from Robert McNamara, Secretary of Defense and one of the principal architects of the Vietnam War.  In 1995, he conceded that he was “wrong, terribly wrong” about the war.  George McGovern was one of the war’s fiercest opponents, saying on the floor of the Senate, “I'm tired of old men dreaming up wars for young men to fight”.\n\n \n\nThere may be no magic elixir of policies to speed the adjustment the US faces.  Look at it this way: the US is trying the mega-stimulus route, while the UK has accelerated its fiscal austerity program.  Yet both countries are struggling with below-trend growth and employment.  Perhaps after a debt binge, there are no easy answers, other than time.  What to do next?  McGovern’s article suggests that an overly interventionist public sector may be the wrong answer, given the unintended consequences.\n\n \n\nMichael Cembalest\n\nChief Investment Officer\n\n \n\n \n\nNotes\n\n[a] I like the idea of extending the holding period for short term capital gains to 3-5 years, and cutting the long term capital gains rate closer to 5%-10%.  It could encourage more business formation, since more of what people create, they keep.  If the cutoff year is properly set, it could be done on a deficit–neutral basis.\n\n \n\n[b] According to methodology described by Keith Poole of the University of San Diego in the American Journal of Political Science, McGovern ranks as the 99th most liberal politician out of 3,320 politicians serving from 1937 to 2002.\n\n \n\n[c] In a letter to the Wall Street Journal.  Reprinted with permission; emphasis added.\n\n \n\n[d] This may not have been a permanent change.  The National Taxpayers Union rated the Blue Dog Democrats as having a fiscal conservatism score of 52% in 1995; by 2009, it had fallen to 18%.\n\n \n\n[e] Would McGovern’s focus on red tape make sense today?  According to surveys conducted by the National Federation of Small Business, the answer would be yes.   The 3 issues most frequently mentioned as each respondent’s “single most important problem” are Poor Sales, Regulation & Red Tape, and Taxes.  Two things of note.  First, Regulation & Red Tape concerns have been steadily rising over the last two years.  Secondly, availability of credit does not show up as an issue.  As the NFIB wrote in May 2011, “92 percent reported that all their credit needs were met or that they were not interested in borrowing.  Eight percent reported that not all of their credit needs were satisfied.

It is not merely we nor the Vietnamese\nwho must live with that fact. So must Israel. So must the American Jews.”\n\nReaction to Berrigan’s polemic was swift and sharp, especially among lawyers who had\nrepresented left-wing causes and individuals. Battle lines were quickly drawn. Some, like\nWilliam Kunstler, supported Berrigan. Others — among them lawyers who had\nrepresented Berrigan and Kunstler — were appalled at Berrigan’s diatribe.\n\nIn 1970, the guild sent a delegation to the Congress of the International Association of\nDemocratic Lawyers — an organization consisting largely of Communist lawyers from\nEastern Europe and “progressive” lawyers from Western Europe. The International\nAssociation of Democratic Lawyers passed a resolution supporting Palestinian terrorism,\ncharacterizing it as “heroic” and “legitimate resistance and ... the expression of a national\nliberation movement constituting an integral part of the world struggle for liberation\nagainst imperialism.” The guild delegates were subjected to considerable pressure from\nthe PLO to conform their organization’s policy to the consensus of “democratic” and\n“progressive” lawyers. It agreed, therefore to commit “the resources of the organization\nto continuing and expanding our internal political education on the Palestinian question.”\n\nAs part of this educational process, the guild subsequently decided to send what it called\nan objective delegation to the Middle East. The organizer of this “objective” group was\nAbdeen Jabara, the founder of the Association of Arab-American University Graduates\nand the editor of Free Palestine, a paper that justified the planting of terrorist bombs in\nuniversities and marketplaces. Jabara arranged for the funding of the three-week, ten-\nperson trip and for its itinerary. The major funding for and sponsorship of this objective\neducational adventure came from none other than the “objective” Palestine Liberation\nOrganization.\n\nThe grateful delegation showed its appreciation for the PLO grant by beginning its\neducation in PLO camps and, according to one member of the delegation, limiting its\ninterviews almost exclusively to PLO-approved Palestinians and Israeli anti-Zionists.\n\nThe resulting report contained few surprises: it presents a sordid caricature of Israel as a\nrepressive totalitarian society which tortures, imprisons, and expels its Arab population without\neven a semblance of reason or justification. Nowhere in the report’s 127 pages is there any\ndiscussion of the PLO terrorism that plagued the civilian population of Israel and the West Bank.\nIndeed, the single mention of terrorism that I was able to find in the report is a quoted reference\nto “acts of terrorism” by Israeli authorities against the peaceful Arab occupants of the West Bank.\n\n332\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_017419\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

(emphasis added). Again, none of these\nfactors is present in this case. The Eleventh Circuit’s interpretation of the statute makes perfect\nsense: were § 1591 not limited in this fashion, it would threaten to criminalize a host of localized\nbehavior that has nothing to do with human trafficking, and, thus, is of no valid federal interest.\n\nIn sum, to accord discretion to the USAO, albeit without benefit of the requested full de novo\nreview, to exercise authority to pursue a prosecution which involves a “novel” application of three\nfederal statutes in the face of numerous “compelling arguments” is not warranted, as it is not\nsupported by the facts, the law, or justice. Echoing the admonition of the Supreme Court in the\nBerger decision, the Comment to Rule 3.8 of the Rules of Professional Conduct (Special\nResponsibilities of a Prosecutor), says it best “A prosecutor has the responsibility of a minister of\njustice and not simply that of an advocate. This responsibility carries with it specific obligations to\nsee that a defendant is accorded procedural justice and that guilt is decided upon the basis of\nsufficient evidence.” This is a responsibility that can not be taken for granted. The government bears\nthe burden of assuring that it possesses sufficient evidence to prove each element of a crime with\nrespect to some specific victim before publicly branding Mr. Epstein a child molester. In this case,\nhowever, the USAO has not met its burden for any victim for any of the crimes alleged. It is not\nenough to simply gloss over the required proof, and rely on the jury or the court to just sort it all out\nin the end. The stakes are too high. As a result, the USAO should not be permitted to pursue an\nunfounded federal criminal case against Mr. Epstein under the guise of prosecutorial discretion.\n\nSuch prosecution in this case necessarily would appear to be selective to Mr. Epstein. To be\nclear, our request that Mr. Epstein should not be prosecuted federally would not permit him to go\ncompletely unpunished, but, rather, would simply place him in the same prosecution position as\nothers similarly situated. Therefore, we continue to believe that after a complete, de novo, and\nindependent review, the only appropriate conclusion will be that this case is best left to the state to\nresolve.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\nSTEPHANIE D.

THE STRUCTURE OF KUE AND THE GENERAL PARTNER\n\nThe following information is a summary of the principal terms of the organizational documents of KUE and\nthe General Partner. The information below is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Amended and\nRestated Limited Partnership Agreement of KUE and the organizational documents of the General\nPartner, including the Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association of the General\nPartner and the Agreement Among Members of the General Partner (the “Organizational Documents”),\ncopies of which have been provided or are available upon request. in the event of any inconsistency\nbetween the terms herein and the terms of the Organizational Documents, the Organizational Documents\nshall control.\n\n14.1. KUE\n\nKUE is constituted as a Cayman islands exempted limited partnership under the Exempted Limited\nPartnership Law (2003 Revision) (the “ELP Law’). A Cayman Islands exempted limited partnership is\nconstituted by the signing of the relevant partnership agreement and its registration with the Registrar of\nExempted Limited Partnerships in the Cayman Islands.\n\nNotwithstanding registration, an exempted limited partnership is not a separate legal person distinct from\nits partners. Under Cayman Islands law, any property of the exempted limited partnership shall be held or\ndeemed to be held by the general partner, and if more than one then by the general partners jointly upon\ntrust, as an asset of the partnership in accordance with the terms of the partnership agreement. Similarly,\nthe general partner for and on behalf of the partnership incurs the debts or obligations of the exempted\nlimited partnership. Registration under the ELP Law eniails that the partnership becomes subject to, and\nthe limited partners therein are afforded the limited liability and other benefits of the ELP Law.\n\nThe business of an exempted limited partnership will be conducted by its general partner(s) who will be\nliable for all debts and obligations of the exempted limited partnership to the extent the partnership has\ninsufficient assets. As a general matter, a limited partner of an exempted limited partnership will not be\nliable for the debts and obligations of the exempied limited partnership save (i) as expressed in the\npartnership agreement, (ii) if such limited partner becomes involved in the conduct of the partnership's\nbusiness or (iii) if such limited partner is obliged pursuant to Section 14(1) of the ELP Law to return a\ndistribution made to it where the exempted limited partnership is insolvent,\n\nThe Limited Partnership Agreement of KUE limits the liability and reduces the fiduciary duties of the\nGeneral Partner to the Limited Partners of KUE (the \"Limited Partners,” and, together with the General\nPartner, the “Partners”) to the full extent of applicable law. The Limited Partnership Agreement also\nrestricts the remedies available to the Limited Partners for actions that might otherwise constitute a\nbreach of the General Partner's fiduciary duties owed to the Limited Partners. By purchasing Units,\nInvestors are treated as having consented to various actions contemplated in the Limited Partnership\nAgreement and conflicts of interest that might otherwise be considered a breach of fiduciary or other\nduties under applicable Cayman law.\n\n14.2. The General Partner\n\nThe General Partner is incorporated in the Cayman Islands as an exempted company with limited liability\nunder the Companies Law (2004 Revision) (the “Companies Law’), The Memorandum and Articles of\nAssociation comprise the constitution of General Partner. The principal business purpose of the General\nPartner is to act as the general partner of KUE, tc own interests in KUE and to engage in activities related\nthereto (the \"Business Purpose\"), The General Partner will not engage in maierial activities (including\nholding any material assets or incurring any material liabilities) unrelated to the Business Purpose, The\nGeneral Partner has no prior operating history or prior business and will not have any substantial assets or\n\n115\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_024548\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

Many people would find the\ncultivation of such a ruthlessly skeptical approach morally repugnant, and we can\nanticipate that even the most proficient system-users would occasionally succumb to the\ntemptation to “befriend” their tools, if only to assuage their discomfort with the execution\nof their duties. No matter how scrupulously the AI designers launder the phony “human”\ntouches out of their wares, we can expect novel habits of thought, conversational gambits\nand ruses, traps and bluffs to arise in this novel setting for human action. The comically\nlong lists of known side effects of new drugs advertised on television will be dwarfed by\nthe obligatory revelations of the sorts of questions that cannot be responsibly answered\nby particular systems, with heavy penalties for those who “overlook” flaws in their\nproducts. It is widely noted that a considerable part of the growing economic inequality\nin today’s world is due to the wealth accumulated by digital entrepreneurs; we should\nenact legislation that puts their deep pockets in escrow for the public good. Some of the\ndeepest pockets are voluntarily out in front of these obligations to serve society first and\nmake money secondarily, but we shouldn’t rely on good will alone.\n\nWe don’t need artificial conscious agents. There is a surfeit of natural conscious\nagents, enough to handle whatever tasks should be reserved for such special and\nprivileged entities. We need intelligent tools. Tools do not have rights, and should not\nhave feelings that could be hurt, or be able to respond with resentment to “abuses” rained\non them by inept users.'* One of the reasons for not making artificial conscious agents is\nthat however autonomous they might become (and in principle, they can be as\nautonomous, as self-enhancing or self-creating, as any person), they would not—without\nspecial provision, which might be waived—share with us natural conscious agents our\nvulnerability or our mortality.\n\nI once posed a challenge to students in a seminar at Tufts I co-taught with\nMatthias Scheutz on artificial agents and autonomy: Give me the specs for a robot that\ncould sign a binding contract with you—not as a surrogate for some human owner but on\nits own. This isn’t a question of getting it to understand the clauses or manipulate a pen\non a piece of paper but of having and deserving legal status as a morally responsible\nagent. Small children can’t sign such contracts, nor can those disabled people whose\nlegal status requires them to be under the care and responsibility of guardians of one sort\nor another. The problem for robots who might want to attain such an exalted status is\nthat, like Superman, they are too invulnerable to be able to make a credible promise. If\nthey were to renege, what would happen? What would be the penalty for promise-\nbreaking? Being locked in a cell or, more plausibly, dismantled? Being locked up is\nbarely an inconvenience for an AI unless we first install artificial wanderlust that cannot\nbe ignored or disabled by the AI on its own (and it would be systematically difficult to\nmake this a foolproof solution, given the presumed cunning and self-knowledge of the\nAI); and dismantling an AI (either a robot or a bedridden agent like Watson) is not killing\nit, if the information stored in its design and software is preserved.

One of the most common routes, known as “buffer overrun,” involves an input\nnumber (or long string of characters) that is bigger than the programmer expected and\noverflows into where the instructions are stored. By carefully designing an input number\nthat is too big by far, someone using a piece of software can infect it with instructions not\nintended by the programmer, and thus change what it does. This is the basis for creating\na computer virus—so named for its similarity to a biological virus. The latter injects\nextra DNA into a cell, and that cell’s transcription and translation mechanism blindly\ninterprets it, making proteins that may be harmful to the host cell. Furthermore, the\nreplication mechanism for the cell takes care of multiplying the virus. Thus, a small\nforeign entity can take control of a much bigger entity and bend its behavior in\nunexpected ways.\n\nThese and other forms of digital attacks have taken the security of our everyday\nlives from us. We rely on computers for almost everything now. We rely on computers\nfor our infrastructure of electricity, gas, roads, cars, trains, and airplanes; these are all\nvulnerable. We rely on computers for our banking, our payment of bills, our retirement\naccounts, our mortgages, our purchasing of goods and services—these, too, are all\nvulnerable. We rely on computers for our entertainment, our communications both\nbusiness and personal, our physical security at home, our information about the world,\nand our voting systems—all vulnerable. None of this will get fixed anytime soon. In the\nmeantime, many aspects of our society are open to vicious attacks, whether by\nfreelancing criminals or nation-state adversaries.\n\nThe second development is that computation has gone beyond simply computing\nfunctions. Instead, programs remain online continuously, and so they can gather data\nabout a sequence of queries.

I used to get frightened flying with her but Bill had the Secret Service with him and I remember \nhim talking about what a good job she did. I only ever met Bill twice but Jeffrey had told me that \nthey were good friends. I asked, \"How come?\" and he laughed and said, \"He owes me some \nfavours.\" Maybe he was just joking but it constantly surprised me that people with as much to lose as \nBill and [Prince] Andrew weren't more careful. She said that when dining that night, Maxwell sat at \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 029225 \nPresident Clinton's left, while they were joined by two 'olive-skinned brunettes' who had been flown \nin from New York... \nI'd never met them before.

They weren't there for Jeffrey or Ghislaine because I was there to have sex \nwith Jeffrey on the trip. \nMaybe Jeffrey thought they would entertain Bill, but I saw no evidence that he was interested in \nthem. He and Jeffrey and Ghislaine seemed to have a very good relationship. Bill was very funny. \nHe made me laugh a few times. And he and Jeffrey and Ghislaine told blokey jokes and the brunettes \nlistened politely and giggled. \nAfter dinner I gave Jeffrey an erotic massage. I don't remember seeing Bill again on the trip but I \nassume Ghislaine flew him back...\" \nJane Doe #3 also concocted another meeting with a powerful political figure for the British tabloid, \nthis time claiming to have met former Vice President Gore and his then wife, Tipper, on the same \nIsland, again providing no specific dates or times, but only personal interest details designed to \nenhance the value of her fictional account \n\"[Jane Doe #3} disclosed that Mr Clinton's vice-president Al Gore and his wife, Tipper, were also \nguests of Epstein on his island... 'I had no clue that anything was up,' [Jane Doe #3] says. 'The Gores \nseemed like a beautiful couple when I met them. All I knew was that Mr Gore was a friend of \nJeffrey's and Ghislaine's. Jeffrey didn't ask me to give him a massage... There might have been a \ncouple of other girls there on that trip but I could never have imagined this guy would do anything \nwrong. I was planning to vote for him when I turned 18. I thought he was awesome.\" \nThese fabrications, which are obvious on their face, could easily have been determined to be false by \nany reasonable investigation. Our investigation has turned up evidence that Mr. Clinton was never \non Mr. Epstein's island, that neither Mr. Gore, nor his former wife, have ever been on the island, and \nthat Mr. and Mrs. Gore do not even know Mr. Epstein. Jane Doe #3's salaciously detailed accounts, \nsold for money to a tabloid are made up and were purposely designed to titillate the interests of \nreaders eager for such salacious material. Jane Doe #3's even more salacious \"descriptions\" of her \nalleged sexual encounters with Dershowitz are also fabricated. \nIf it turns out that Jane Doe #3 deliberately lied about seeing former President Clinton on the island, \nshe would be guilty of perjury. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 029226 \nMr. Dershowitz's legal team has uncovered additional evidence, which it is in the process of \nverifying, that proves a pattern of lying and false accusations that casts even further doubt on Jane \nDoe #3's credibility.

We sent our other reserve division towards the crossroads to\nprovide support, and Amram went with them to co-ordinate the operation. But\nIra still had to fight his way out. It was 15 minutes of hell. By the time he\nreached safety at around nine in the morning, he’d lost ten tanks and nearly 20\nmen, four of them during the final, frantic retreat. Five more were missing. The\nreserve division also found itself in a fierce firefight with the Syrians, and lost\neleven men.\n\nWe were now just three hours from the cease-fire.

Cabot Professor of American Literature \nDear Woody, \nTel: \nFax \nAs I know Jeffrey has told you, I really enjoyed our conversation on the plane last spring about William \nCarlos Williams's \"This Is Just to Say.\" You offered a reading of the poem that seemed to me \ncompletely persuasive and plausible and, yet, also, one that is not strictly dictated or delimited by the \nlines themselves. These are lines that seem to me unusually open to divergent readings-- including, for \ninstance, a reading much more coaxing and seductive; another, much more defensive and manipulative; \nanother, much more about language itself as a mode of sharing. I left our conversation wanting to \nexplore with you the aggressive (or maybe mock aggressive) reading you gave, as well as the way this \npoem, perhaps more than many, sustains so many readings. You helped me think about Williams's \npoem as it seems in some ways more like a \"script\" than a poem, a poem written in such a way as to be \nturned by different voices in different directions, a poem that might even be \"directed\" by the reader. I'd \nlove to hear you read the poem again and, if you are willing, to discuss it a bit with me on camera for my \nupcoming Massive Open Online Course on American poetry. \nTo remind you, the course I'm working on is Poetry in America, one of three Humanities courses that \nwill be launched internationally by edX in the next 18 months. This free course will allow students of all \nages around the world to immerse themselves in the history, the art, and the interpretation of American \npoetry. Using state of the art tools, the course will combine text, video, audio, archival materials, on site \nhistorical narrative and interactive features, and it will have a companion book that docks with it. (I'm \nwriting that book now.) \nAs I'm asking you here, I am inviting other distinguished Americans to do short cameo readings and, \nwhen they are willing, short discussions of the poem with me. Those who have already done tapings, or \nhave agreed to participate, include Supreme Court Justice Elena Kagan, Harvard President Drew \nFaust, performer and activist Eve Ensler, journalist Michael Pollan, Tour de France champion Greg \nLemond, professor and PBS personality Henry Lewis Gates, (my husband!) Larry Summers, Rabbi \nMoshe Waldoks, poet Martin Espada, playwright Tony Kushner, and Boston Mayor Thomas Menino. \nWe are now reaching out to Bill Clinton, Matt Damon, Natalie Portman, and John McCain, among \nothers, and feel confident that many will agree. I'm very much hoping that you will agree to join this \ndistinguished group. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 029543 \nThe poem I'm hoping you would read is one that we discussed, William Carlos Williams's iconic poem \n\"This Is Just to Say.\" The poem is copied below. There are, naturally, commentaries on it I could share, \nif you wanted to read some, but you seem to have already thought about it quite a bit. \nThis Is Just to Say \nI have eaten \nthe plums \nthat were in \nthe icebox \nand which \nyou were probably \nsaving \nfor breakfast \nForgive me \nthey were delicious \nso sweet \nand so cold \nLogistically, we are at your service. I would be happy to film you when I visit New York on October \n24th. Or, I would love it if you would come visit Larry and me in Boston with Jeffrey. We could show \nyou and Soon Yi around Harvard, eat a big bowl of plums, and talk poetry. I would introduce you on \ncamera and you'd read, or recite, and we'd perhaps talk about the poem for a moment. \nThank you very much for considering this proposal.

Figure 6.3 shows part of the architecture via which\ncognitive processes interact with each other, via commonly acting on the AtomSpace knowledge\nrepository.\n\nComparing these diagrams to the integrative human cognitive architecture diagrams given\nin Chapter 5, one sees the main difference is that the CogPrime diagrams commit to specific\nstructures (e.g. knowledge representations) and processes, whereas the generic integrative archi-\ntecture diagram refers merely to types of structures and processes. For instance, the integrative\ndiagram refers generally to declarative knowledge and learning, whereas the CogPrime diagram\nrefers to PLN, as a specific system for reasoning and learning about declarative knowledge. Ta-\nble 6.1 articulates the key connections between the components of the CogPrime diagram and\nthose of the integrative diagram, thus indicating the general cognitive functions instantiated by\neach of the CogPrime components.\n\n6.3 Current and Prior Applications of OpenCog\n\nBefore digging deeper into the theory, and elaborating some of the dynamics underlying the\nabove diagrams, we pause to briefly discuss some of the practicalities of work done with the\nOpenCog system currently implementing parts of the CogPrime architecture.\n\nOpenCog, the open-source software framework underlying the “OpenCogPrime” (currently\npartial) implementation of the CogPrime architecture, has been used for commercial applica-\ntions in the area of natural language processing and data mining; for instance, see [GPPG06]\nwhere OpenCogPrime’s PLN reasoning and RelEx language processing are combined to do\nautomated biological hypothesis generation based on information gathered from PubMed ab-\nstracts. Most relevantly to the present work, it has also been used to control virtual agents in\nvirtual worlds [GEA08].\n\nPrototype work done during 2007-2008 involved using an OpenCog variant called the Open-\nPetBrain to control virtual dogs in a virtual world (see Figure 6.6 for a screenshot of an\nOpenPetBrain-controlled virtual dog). While these OpenCog virtual dogs did not display in-\ntelligence closely comparable to that of real dogs (or human children), they did demonstrate a\nvariety of interesting and relevant functionalities including:\n\ne learning new behaviors based on imitation and reinforcement\n\ne responding to natural language commands and questions, with appropriate actions and\nnatural language replies\n\n® spontaneous exploration of their world, remembering their experiences and using them to\nbias future learning and linguistic interaction\n\nOne current OpenCog initiative involves extending the virtual dog work via using OpenCog\nto control virtual agents in a game world inspired by the game Minecraft. These agents are\ninitially specifically concerned with achieving goals in a game world via constructing structures\nwith blocks and carrying out simple English communications. Representative example tasks\nwould be:\n\ne Learning to build steps or ladders to get desired objects that are high up\ne Learning to build a shelter to protect itself from aggressors\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_013024\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

When von Neumann’s\nabstract machine reproduced, it made a copy of itself in another region of the plane.\nWithin the “machine” was a horizontal line of squares which acted as a finite linear tape,\nusing a subset of the finite alphabet. It was the symbols in those squares that encoded the\nmachine of which they were a part. During the machine’s reproduction, the “tape” could\nmove either left or right and was both interpreted (transcribed) as the instructions\n(translation) for the new “machine” being built and then copied (replicated)—with the\nnew copy being placed inside the new machine for further reproduction. Francis Crick\nand James Watson later showed, in 1953, how such a tape could be instantiated in\nbiology by along DNA molecule with its finite alphabet of four nucleobases: guanine,\ncytosine, adenine, and thymine (G, C, A, and T).'* Asin von Neumann’s machine, in\nbiological reproduction the linear sequence of symbols in DNA is interpreted—through\ntranscription into RNA molecules, which then are translated into proteins, the structures\nthat make up a new cell—and the DNA is replicated and encased in the new cell.\n\nA second foundational piece of work was in a 1945 “First Draft” report on the\ndesign for a digital computer, wherein von Neumann advocated for a memory that could\ncontain both instructions and data.'4 This is now known as a von Neumann architecture\ncomputer—as distinct from a Harvard architecture computer, where there are two\nseparate memories, one for instructions and one for data. The vast majority of computer\nchips built in the era of Moore’s Law are based on the von Neumann architecture,\nincluding those powering our data centers, our laptops, and our smartphones. Von\nNeumann’s digital-computer architecture 1s conceptually the same generalization—from\nearly digital computers constructed with electromagnetic relays at both Harvard\nUniversity and Bletchley Park—that occurs in going from a special-purpose Turing\nMachine to a Universal Turing Machine. Furthermore, his self-replicating automata\nshare a fundamental similarity with both the construction of a Turing Machine and the\nmechanism of DNA-based reproducing biological cells. There is to this day scholarly\ndebate over whether von Neumann saw the cross connections between these three pieces\nof work, Turing’s and his two. Turing’s revision of his paper was done while he and von\nNeumann were both at Princeton; indeed, after getting his PhD, Turing almost stayed on\nas von Neumann’s postdoc.\n\nWithout Turing and von Neumann, the cybernetics of Wiener might have\nremained a dominant mode of thought and driver of technology for much longer than its\nbrief moment of supremacy. In this imaginary version of history, we might well live\ntoday in an actual steam-punk world and not just get to observe its fantastical\ninstantiations at Maker Faires!\n\nMy point is that Wiener thought about the world—physical, biological, and (in\nHuman Use) sociological—in a particular way. He analyzed the world as continuous\nvariables, as he explains in chapter 1 along with a nod to thermodynamics through an\noverlay of Gibbs statistics. He also shoehorns in a weak and unconvincing model of\ninformation as message-passing between and among both physical and biological entities.\nTo me, and from today’s vantage point seventy years on, his tools seem woefully\n\n13“ Structure for Deoxyribose Nucleic Acid,” Nature 171, 737-738 (1953).\n\n14 hitps://en.wikipedia.org//wiki/First_Draft_of_a_Report_on_ the EDVAC#Controversy.

In a speech in Brussels,\nhe dismissed most of America’s European allies as a useless bunch of\ntimewasters. I paraphrase — but not much.\n\nMr Gates pointed out that while all Nato countries had voted to\nintervene in Libya, most had chosen not to participate in the actual\nfighting. Even those European countries that are taking part began to\nrun short of munitions just 11 weeks into the fighting — forcing an\nexasperated America to step into the breach. More broadly, a\nsituation in which the US accounts for 75 per cent of the military\nspending in Nato was “unacceptable” and unsustainable. If it is not\nrectified, Mr Gates predicted, Nato faces a “dismal” future.\n\nThe conjunction of the Gates speech and the Syrian civil war is very\ntelling. It explains why a 20-year experiment with the idea that\nwestern military force can put the world to rights is coming to a\nclose.\n\nJust a few weeks ago, that would have seemed a surprising\nconclusion. Supporters of “liberal interventionism”’ hailed the\ndecision to bomb Colonel Gaddafi’s forces in Libya as evidence of a\nlonged-for new era, in which dictators can no longer feel free to\nmassacre their own people.\n\nHowever a western failure to intervene, as the Syrian army brutalises\nand kills its own citizens, is likely to be a more accurate guide to the\nfuture than the Libyan campaign.

Jets belonging to TWA, Pan Am and Swissair were seized by the Popular Front\nfor the Liberation of Palestine. The group also attempted to hijack a jet over London belonging to the\nIsraeli airline El Al but was thwarted by security guards on board.\n\nThe Pan Am seizure ended quickly, but the passengers on the TWA and Swissair jets were diverted\nto a British air base in Jordan and the drama only ended after days of tense diplomacy, when the\nhostages were all released in a deal in which the Swiss, German, British and Israeli governments let\n\nPalestinian prisoners go.” (http://www.cnn.com/2015/07/27/politics/terrorism-19 70s-richard-\nnixon/index.html)\n\nThis 9/11 response sounds quite normal of course.

Sluggish growth across the\ndeveloped world, stagnant incomes for much of the population, rising\neconomic inequality, political gridlock, and the emergence of populist\ninsurgencies on both sides of the political spectrum have fueled a\nwidespread sense that Western models of governance and economic\nmanagement are floundering.\n\nMany of these problems are real and important. But they are not beyond the\ncapacity of determined leadership to solve, nor do they represent\nfundamental weaknesses of the Western model. So the pessimism strikes us\nas dramatically overdone, like previous bouts of declinism and worry that\nthe West's best days were past. The greatest danger, in fact, is that the\nwidespread pessimism will become a self-fulfilling prophecy. Gloomy\nWestern policymakers and publics are more likely to see threats than\nopportunities and to turn away from the world rather than continue to lead\nit successfully.\n\nThis is notable in the rising opposition, for example, to the Trans-Pacific\nPartnership, a major trade deal that would help extend and deepen the\nliberal order across a broad swath of the globe. It is evident in the increasing\nsuspicion of immigrants and refugees and in the growing support for closing\nborders. And it can be seen in the fraying and potential unraveling of\ninternational institutions such as the European Union, formerly a model of\nprogressive international integration.\n\nIt would be a terrible shame if the West walked away from the very\ninternational order that it created after World War II and that has facilitated\nso much security, prosperity, and development over the decades. Instead, it\nshould try to reinvigorate that order, with three moves in particular:\nworking with China and India, bolstering international rules, and\naccentuating the positive global trends that get lost in all the hysteria about\nthe negative ones.\n\nWhy China and India? Because they have the largest populations and\neconomies in the developing world, are led by strong, reform-minded\nleaders, and are approaching the future with dynamism, optimism, and\nhope. Both understand that they need to take on greater responsibilities in\nconfronting global problems, and as last fall's Paris climate agreement\ndemonstrates, they are already starting to do so.\n\nAlthough China's rise has been one of the universally acknowledged\nwonders of the age, India's recent rise has been impressive as well, as India,\ntoo, has embraced modernization, globalization, and Enlightenment\nrationalism.

This might have seemed like a form of hazing for Cohn, whose grasp of\nlegislative matters was even more limited than that of most in the White House.\n\nOn Friday, March 24, the morning of the theoretical House vote for the Republican\nhealth care bill, Politico’s Playbook characterized the chances of a vote actually coming to\nthe floor as a “toss-up.” In that morning’s senior staff meeting, Cohn was asked for an\nassessment of where things stood and promptly said, “I think it’s a toss-up.”\n\n“Really?” thought Katie Walsh. “That’s what you think?”\n\nBannon, joining Walsh in a pitiless contempt for the White House effort, targeted\nKushner, Cohn, Priebus, Price, and Ryan in a series of calls to reporters.

This was vintage Bannon analysis: a certain\nand immediate political apocalypse that sat side by side with the potential for a half\ncentury of Bannonism-Trumpism rule.\n\nConvinced he knew the direction of success, keenly aware of his own age and finite\nopportunities, and—if for no clear reason—seeing himself as a talented political infighter,\nBannon sought to draw the line between believers and sell-outs, being and nothingness.\nFor him to succeed, he needed to isolate the Ryan, Cohn, and Kushner factions.\n\nThe Bannon faction held tight on forcing a vote on the health care bill—even knowing\ndefeat was inevitable. “I want it as a report on Ryan’s job as Speaker,” said Bannon.

It was the\nlast day of the Tango World Championship semifinals, and this was our final run in front of the judges,\ntelevision cameras, and cheering crowds. The other couples had an average of 15 years together. For us,\nit was the culmination of 5 months of nonstop 6-hour practices, and finally, it was showtime.\n\n“How are you doing?” Alicia, a seasoned professional dancer, asked me in her distinctly Argentine\nSpanish.\n\n“Fantastic. Awesome. Let’s just enjoy the music. Forget the crowd—they’re not even here.”\n\nThat wasn’t entirely true. It was hard to even fathom 50,000 spectators and coordinators in La Rural,\neven if it was the biggest exhibition hall in Buenos Aires. Through the thick haze of cigarette smoke, you\ncould barely make out the huge undulating mass in the stands, and everywhere there was exposed floor,\nexcept the sacred 30’ x 40' space in the middle of it all. I adjusted my pin-striped suit and fussed with my\nblue silk handkerchief until it was obvious that I was just fidgeting.\n\n“Are you nervous?”\n“Tm not nervous. I’m excited. I’m just going to have fun and let the rest follow.”\n\n“Number 152, you’re up.” Our chaperone had done his job, and now it was our turn. I whispered an\ninside joke to Alicia as we stepped on the hardwood platform: “Tranquilo” —Take it easy. She laughed,\nand at just that moment, I thought to myself, “What on earth would I be doing right now, if I hadn’t left\nmy job and the U.S. over a year ago?”\n\nThe thought vanished as quickly as it had appeared when the announcer came over the loudspeaker\nand the crowd erupted to match him: “Pareja numero 152, Timothy Ferriss y Alicia Monti, Ciudad de\nBuenos Aires!!!”\n\nWe were on, and I was beaming.\n\nTHE MOST FUNDAMENTAL of American questions is hard for me to answer these days, and luckily so.

The beauty is, ’m not a\nmultimillionaire, nor do I particularly care to be.\n\nI never enjoyed answering this cocktail question because it reflects an epidemic I was long part of: job\ndescriptions as self-descriptions.

You would not be able \nto do a competing book or documentary before then. This is not to say that they shouldn't be pursued. In a \nsense, better that they know what Patterson's position is and, a year from now say, be able to counter it. I have \nsome thoughts on book and doc to share at your convenience. \nThat being said, you do need an immediate counter narrative to the book. I believe Trump offers an ideal \nopportunity. It's a chance to make the story about something other than you, while, at the same time, letting you \nframe your own story. Also, becoming an anti-Trump voice gives you a certain political cover which you \ndecidedly don't have now. Still, this necessary involves you going public. And so the most basic decision is \nabout your willingness to do that. My view is that in a couple of weeks you could master message and technical \nproficiency. I know a bunch of people who could be very helpful here. This would involve something along the \nlines of you writing an op-ed, doing a high profile television interview (Charlie Rose, I'd say), and perhaps \nsome social media efforts. \nSpeaking of which, again, I think a strategic plan, involving your public identity, philanthropic activities and \ninterests, and the development of media allies, ought finally to be put in place. A big, comprehensive, expensive \neffort. \nThe alternative is to continue to keep head down and hope Patterson book is just more he-said she-said and \nConnolly getting lost in the reeds (which, as an inveterate conspiracist, he always does). My worry is that \nPatterson can be counted on to produce a bestseller, and while he isn't regarded as a serious writer, he'll surely \nbe unloading a lot of tabloid copy. Because this will be tied to the election, the Trump-Clinton angle will amp \nup the attention 10-fold, in fact, possibly, a hundred fold. Possibly more than anything you've encountered \nbefore. \nMeanwhile--\nIn a lawyer's letter, I'd suggest including the following points--not necessarily legal, but a warning about how a \npress campaign might unfold (publishers are more worried about being caught in negative media controversy \nthan they are of legal threats): \n1) Little, Brown has made on the record representations to at least one well-known journalist that it was not \npublishing a book by James Patterson about Jeffrey Epstein--possibly an effort to avoid inquiries about the \nquestionable nature of the book; \n2) The actual author of the book, John Connolly, is someone other than the stated author, James Patterson. \nConnolly is known to have developed an obsession with Epstein, such that, his longtime employer, Vanity Fair, \nhas refused to allow him to write about Epstein for the magazine; \n3) Sources have confirmed for us that Patterson has had little more than a minimal consulting role in the book, \nand that Connolly has functioned in every material way as the book's researcher and writer. We believe \nPatterson's \"authorship\" of the book will not stand up to scrutiny. And, indeed, that the entire notion of an \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 032244 \nextension of the Patterson franchise into nonfiction, as it has been used in fiction and children's book--\neffectively other authors writing under the Patterson name—presents a host of journalism ethical issues. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 032245 \n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

From the perspective of defending\nthemselves from potential threats, the deal that these allies had with\nthe NSA was mutually advantageous.\n\nThe NSA‘s overseas intelligence gathering was not limited to\nadversary nations. With the exception of the Five Eyes allies, it\ngathered data that was deemed important by the president and the\nDefense Department in friendly countries. These operations had\nbeen approved by every American president and funded by every\nAmerican Congress since 1941. After all, even in the realm of allies,\nactivities take place that run counter to American interests. The 9/11\nconspiracy, for example, was hatched in Hamburg, Germany, and\nfinanced in Dubai and Saudi Arabia.\n\nNor were American allies unaware of the reach of the NSA. “Yes,\nmy continental European friends, we have spied on you. And it is\ntrue we use computers to sort through data by using keywords,”\nthe former CIA director James Woolsey wrote in The Wall Street\nJournal in 2000. “Have you stopped to ask yourselves what we are\nlooking for?” Whether or not it was appreciated by other countries,\n\n© the global harvesting of communications intelligence by the NSA ©\nwas hardly a secret.\n\nAs the NSA expanded further, it delegated part of its work to\nregional bases, including ones in Utah, Texas, Hawaii, and Japan. The\nparamount task of the NSA remained monitoring the channels of\ncommunications that an adversary might use. The vast prolifera-\ntion of these channels in cyberspace, which included e-mail, social\nmedia, document sharing, and other innovations of the Internet age,\ngreatly complicated this task. Even so, this challenge was not insur-\nmountable, because most of the Internet actually traveled through\nfiberglass landline cables that crossed the territories of the United\nStates, Britain, and Australia. So the NSA found the technical means,\nincluding voluntarily gaining access to major Internet companies, to\n“harvest” vast amounts of this Internet data. America’s other intel-\nligence agencies quickly recognized the value of the communica-\ntions intelligence gleaned from foreign telecommunications. John E.\nMcLaughlin, who was the CIA’s acting director in 2004, described\nthe NSA as nothing less than the “very foundation of U.S. intel-\nligence.” It served as a “foundation” for the CIA because intercepted\n\n| | Epst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.indd 202 ® 9/30/16 8:13AM | |\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_019690\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

He was the Tea Party-Bannon-Breitbart punch line: the ultimate empty\nsuit, a hee-haw sort of joke and an embarrassment.\n\nTrump’s distaste for Ryan was significantly less structural. He had no views about\nRyan’s political abilities, and had paid no real attention to Ryan’s actual positions. His\nview was personal. Ryan had insulted him—again and again. Ryan had kept betting\nagainst him. Ryan had become the effective symbol of the Republican establishment’s\nhorror and disbelief about Trump. Adding insult to injury, Ryan had even achieved some\nmoral stature by dissing Trump (and, as usual, he considered anybody’s gain at his\nexpense a double insult). By the spring of 2016, Ryan was still, and by then the only,\nalternative to Trump as the nominee. Say the word, many Republicans felt, and the\nconvention would stampede to Ryan. But Ryan’s seemingly smarter calculation was to let\nTrump win the nomination, and then to emerge as the obvious figure to lead the party after\nTrump’s historic defeat and the inevitable purge of the Tea Party-Trump-Breitbart wing.\n\nInstead, the election destroyed Paul Ryan, at least in Steve Bannon’s eyes. Trump had\nnot only saved the Republican Party but had given it a powerful majority. The entire\nBannon dream had been realized. The Tea Party movement, with Trump as its remarkable\nface and voice, had come to power—something like total power. It owned the Republican\nParty. Publicly breaking Paul Ryan was the obvious and necessary step.\n\nBut a great deal could fall into the chasm between Bannon’s structural contempt for\nRyan and Trump’s personal resentment. If Bannon saw Ryan as being unwilling and\nunable to carry out the new Bannon-Trump agenda, Trump saw a chastened Ryan as\nsuddenly and satisfyingly abject, submissive, and useful. Bannon wanted to get rid of the\nentire Republican establishment; Trump was wholly satisfied that it now seemed to bend\nto him.\n\n“He’s quite a smart guy,” Trump said after his first postelection conversation with the\nSpeaker. “A very serious man. Everybody respects him.”\n\nRyan, “rising to a movie-version level of flattery and sucking-up painful to witness,”\naccording to one senior Trump aide, was able to delay his execution. As Bannon pressed\nhis case for Meadows—who was significantly less yielding than Ryan—Trump dithered\nand then finally decided that not only was he not going to push for Ryan’s ouster, but Ryan\nwas going to be his man, his partner. In an example of the odd and unpredictable effects of\npersonal chemistry on Trump—of how easy it can be to sell the salesman—Trump would\nnow eagerly back Ryan’s agenda instead of the other way around.\n\n“T don’t think that we quite calculated that the president would give him carte blanche,”\nreflected Katie Walsh. “The president and Paul went from such a bad place during the\ncampaign to such a romance afterward that the president was happy to go along with\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_020005\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

You would not be \nable to do a competing book or documentary before then. This is not to say that they shouldn't be pursued. In \na sense, better that they know what Patterson's position is and, a year from now say, be able to counter it. I \nhave some thoughts on book and doc to share at your convenience. \nThat being said, you do need an immediate counter narrative to the book. I believe Trump offers an ideal \nopportunity. It's a chance to make the story about something other than you, while, at the same time, letting \nyou frame your own story. Also, becoming an anti-Trump voice gives you a certain political cover which you \ndecidedly don't have now. Still, this necessary involves you going public. And so the most basic decision is \nabout your willingness to do that. My view is that in a couple of weeks you could master message and \ntechnical proficiency. I know a bunch of people who could be very helpful here. This would involve something \nalong the lines of you writing an op-ed, doing a high profile television interview (Charlie Rose, I'd say), and \nperhaps some social media efforts. \nSpeaking of which, again, I think a strategic plan, involving your public identity, philanthropic activities and \ninterests, and the development of media allies, ought finally to be put in place. A big, comprehensive, \nexpensive effort. \nThe alternative is to continue to keep head down and hope Patterson book is just more he-said she-said and \nConnolly getting lost in the reeds (which, as an inveterate conspiracist, he always does). My worry is that \nPatterson can be counted on to produce a bestseller, and while he isn't regarded as a serious writer, he'll \nsurely be unloading a lot of tabloid copy. Because this will be tied to the election, the Trump-Clinton angle will \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 032250 \namp up the attention 10-fold, in fact, possibly, a hundred fold. Possibly more than anything you've \nencountered before. \nMeanwhile--\nIn a lawyer's letter, I'd suggest including the following points--not necessarily legal, but a warning about how a \npress campaign might unfold (publishers are more worried about being caught in negative media controversy \nthan they are of legal threats): \n1) Little, Brown has made on the record representations to at least one well-known journalist that it was not \npublishing a book by James Patterson about Jeffrey Epstein--possibly an effort to avoid inquiries about the \nquestionable nature of the book; \n2) The actual author of the book, John Connolly, is someone other than the stated author, James Patterson. \nConnolly is known to have developed an obsession with Epstein, such that, his longtime employer, Vanity Fair, \nhas refused to allow him to write about Epstein for the magazine; \n3) Sources have confirmed for us that Patterson has had little more than a minimal consulting role in the book, \nand that Connolly has functioned in every material way as the book's researcher and writer. We believe \nPatterson's \"authorship\" of the book will not stand up to scrutiny. And, indeed, that the entire notion of an \nextension of the Patterson franchise into nonfiction, as it has been used in fiction and children's book--\neffectively other authors writing under the Patterson name—presents a host of journalism ethical issues. \nplease note \nThe information contained in this communication is \nconfidential, may be attorney-client privileged, may \nconstitute inside information, and is intended only for \nthe use of the addressee.

While the growth in these times is small,\nit is significant: sovereigns are increasingly dependent\non their alternative investments to generate yields,\nhowever, growing levels of undeployed capital for\nalternative investments are being held in cash and\nmoney market funds, so that sovereigns can respond\nquickly when real asset opportunities arise.

The Old Testament prophets, who delivered the underlying logic,\nincluded Thomas Hobbes and Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz. The New Testament prophets\nincluded Alan Turing, John von Neumann, Claude Shannon, and Norbert Wiener. They\ndelivered the machines.\n\nAlan Turing wondered what it would take for machines to become intelligent.\nJohn von Neumann wondered what it would take for machines to self-reproduce. Claude\nShannon wondered what it would take for machines to communicate reliably, no matter\nhow much noise intervened. Norbert Wiener wondered how long it would take for\nmachines to assume control.\n\nWiener’s warnings about control systems beyond human control appeared in\n1949, just as the first generation of stored-program electronic digital computers were\nintroduced. These systems required direct supervision by human programmers,\nundermining his concerns. What’s the problem, as long as programmers are in control of\nthe machines? Ever since, debate over the risks of autonomous control has remained\nassociated with the debate over the powers and limitations of digitally coded machines.\nDespite their astonishing powers, little real autonomy has been observed. This is a\ndangerous assumption. What if digital computing is being superseded by something\nelse?\n\nElectronics underwent two fundamental transitions over the past hundred years:\nfrom analog to digital and from vacuum tubes to solid state. That these transitions\noccurred together does not mean they are inextricably linked. Just as digital computation\nwas implemented using vacuum tube components, analog computation can be\nimplemented in solid state. Analog computation is alive and well, even though vacuum\ntubes are commercially extinct.\n\nThere 1s no precise distinction between analog and digital computing. In general,\ndigital computing deals with integers, binary sequences, deterministic logic, and time that\nis idealized into discrete increments, whereas analog computing deals with real numbers,\nnondeterministic logic, and continuous functions, including time as it exists as a\ncontinuum in the real world.\n\nImagine you need to find the middle of a road. You can measure its width using\nany available increment and then digitally compute the middle to the nearest increment.\nOr you can use a piece of string as an analog computer, mapping the width of the road to\nthe length of the string and finding the middle, without being limited to increments, by\ndoubling the string back upon itself.\n\nMany systems operate across both analog and digital regimes. A tree integrates a\nwide range of inputs as continuous functions, but if you cut down that tree, you find that\nit has been counting the years digitally all along.\n\n37\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_016840\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

In life, it was\nflightless, secretive and rare, living in the dense jungle thicket of the island of Sulawesi, Indonesia. Its call was sonorous but strange - a kind of low rumble or hum,\nlike a deep snore - the signature of Aramidopsis plateni, the Snoring Rail.\nThe bird's hunter, 36-year-old Gerd Heinrich, had been searching Sulawesi for nearly two years, bagging insects, mammals and other birds, but holding out for the\nSnoring Rail. Its capture established his reputation as a collector, earned him his nickname, die Ralle, and would come to symbolize a life dedicated to discovery.\nIt would also capture the imagination of his son Bernd, a distinguished biologist at the University of Vermont and best-selling author (Mind of a Raven, Bumblebee\nEconomics). In The Snoring Bird, Bernd Heinrich leads us through his family's extraordinary history, which begins in Europe, ends in America and is shaped at\nevery turn by the rise of the science of biology. With his usual warmth, grace and insight, Heinrich has created an unconventional memoir - equal parts father and\nson - that explores two radically different, often conflicting approaches to understanding the natural world.\nThe journey begins at Heinrich's childhood home in rural Maine when, years after Gerd's death, he comes across a pile of his father's personal effects. Strewn around\nthe barn and covered in guano, they would tell a remarkable tale. Gerd was born in Berlin in 1896 but spent his early life on an idyllic agricultural estate in Poland,\nBorowke, which he called the \"home of my soul.\"\nHis days were passed on the land, observing and collecting nature's spoils. Then, the First World War intervened. Just 17, Gerd enlisted and eventually joined the\nLuftwaffe as a pilot, was sought out by the legendary Red Baron and earned an Iron Cross for bravery. Shot down twice over enemy territory, he survived to return\nto his beloved Borowke, where he soon rediscovered his \"old zoological passion to live it again.\"\nSoon after, Gerd encountered a lifelong intellectual companion in Erwin Stresemann, curator of birds at the Museum für Naturkunde in Berlin. Their friendship would\nsurvive another war, \"revolution, invasion, expulsion, starvation, and emigration.\" It was Stresemann who, in 1927, sent Gerd on his first zoological expedition, to\nPersia, and fuelled his ambitions as a naturalist. In addition to Persia and Sulawesi, Gerd would lead zoological expeditions to Burma, Angola, Tanzania and\nelsewhere.\nWhile collecting specimens around the world, he was able to pursue an abiding passion, ichneumons, \"mysterious and exotic wasps that are parasitic connoisseurs,\"\nand went on to describe 1,479 new species in his lifetime. He became one of the world's foremost experts on these rarefied creatures, obsessively collecting and\ncarefully differentiating one species from another based on subtle differences in body markings or shape, just as Vladimir Nabokov had done with his \"blues\" in the\nbutterfly world.\nGerd's desire to publish his manuscript on Oriental ichneumons brought him and his family to the United States when he was 55. There, he lived in poverty, an\namateur naturalist marginalized by the scientific community. Yet in rural Maine, living in an old farmhouse with no electricity and no running water, he was close to\nthe wilderness, which meant freedom. He had found New Borowke.\nIn the latter half of The Snoring Bird, Bernd Heinrich's story, we learn that he has also settled in Maine and that he shares his father's faith: \"I believe ... that our\nwell-being is tied not so much to the structure of our society and the politics that determine it, as to our ability to maintain contact with nature, to feel that we are part\nof the natural order.\" It is this shared belief and fascination with the natural world that led them both to the frontiers of biology; and, it is there that their lives\ndiverged dramatically.\nGerd practised taxonomy, a descriptive science, while Bernd liked to experiment. Gerd's work was \"drudgery,\" whereas Bernd's was (and, one gets the sense, still is)\n\"purest joy.\" Species identification, once at the forefront of biology, came to be derided as mere \"stamp collecting.\" By contrast, experimentation has become the\nparadigm for modern biology and its growth logarithmic.\nModern biology's currency, Heinrich reminds us, is ideas. He has had many. Big ones. Ones published in leading journals, including Science, and which earned\nhim prestigious professorships and the admiration of his peers. They also brought him an unusual degree of academic freedom, which he has used to full effect, often\ntaking laypeople along on his wide-ranging journeys of discovery - into the minds of ravens, for instance - through popular writing.\n1 of 2 6/12/07 4:24 PM\nglobeandmail.com: Nature memoir is anything but a snooze\nfile://localhost/Users/Lborth/Heinrich%20Book%20Review.html\nBernd's chapters here are earnest and humorous, and offer a window into the making of a scientist. But it is the early chapters on Gerd's life that captivate.\nHeinrich skillfully recreates his father's story, through correspondence, an unpublished memoir and remembrances, to create a nuanced portrait - at times generous, at\nother times hostile.\nGerd never celebrated his son's success as a scientist - at least not outwardly. The conflict between old science and new tainted their relationship, and Gerd's struggle\nfor recognition in science made him resentful. On the other hand, Bernd struggled for years to see the value in his father's science and to understand his motivations.\nThe memoir documents this struggle and builds to an ardent defence of his father's choices and of specimen-collecting biology: \"There was a purpose, an ethic, even\na morality to what naturalists of his time practised\"; \"Biology is history, and no amount of chemistry can explain how or why the different ichneumon wasps came\ninto being, or what role they play in different ecosystems\"; \"Naming before knowing.\"\nImportantly, The Snoring Bird reminds us that science itself evolves, and that scientists are a product of their time and culture. Bernd Heinrich leaves us with no\ndoubt that in Gerd's youth, \"the naturalists' reputation shone brightly,\" and that taxonomy has provided biologists with a framework for thinking about the natural\nworld, upon which modern biology is built.\nBut he glosses over the fact that biology is in the midst of a new - some would say revolutionary - effort to catalogue Earth's biological diversity, using a short\nsequence of each organism's DNA called DNA barcodes. They have verified past species divisions - those determined by taxonomists such as Gerd - and clarified\nothers; and, they represent another tool with which to understand and protect this bounty. In barcoding, an old science has become new again - albeit transformed.\nBut it is proof that to most of us, nature is still \"a magic show of the highest order,\" and that the values of naturalists such as Bernd and Gerd Heinrich live on.\nLindsay Borthwick is a science journalist living in Toronto.

It was also the\ntime when I grew from a young child —introspective and contemplative, aware\nof how quickly my mind seemed to grasp numbers and geometric shapes and\nmusical notes, but also small for my age and awkward at the sports we’d play\non the dusty field at the far edge of the kibbutz — into a sense of my own place\nin the family and community and the country around me. I did, along the way,\nbecome arguably the most effective left defensive back on our kibbutz soccer\nteam. But that was not because I suddenly discovered a buried talent for the\ngame. Physically, I was like my father. I had natural hand coordination which\nmade delicate tasks come easily — one reason I would soon discover a pastime\nthat lent itself to acts of kibbutz mischief bordering on juvenile delinquency.\nBut when it came to larger muscles, I was hapless, if not hopeless. My prowess\nas a soccer defenseman was because no opposing player in his right mind, once\nI’d inadvertently cut his knees from under him when aiming for the ball, felt it\nwas worth coming anywhere close to me.\n\nBut when the war broke out in earnest in the spring of 1948, my focus, like\nthat of all Israelis, was on the fighting, which even the youngest of us knew\nwould determine whether the state would survive at all. Day after day, my\nfather helped me to chart each major advance and setback on a little map.\nDozens of kibbutzim around the country were in the line of fire. Some had soon\nfallen, while others were barely managing to hang on. Just five miles inland\nfrom us, an Israeli settlement came under attack by an Iraqi force in the nearby\nArab village of Qaqun.\n\nBut inside Mishmar Hasharon, I had the almost surreal feeling that this great\nhistorical drama was something happening everywhere else but on our kibbutz.\nIf it hadn’t been for the radio, or the newsreels which we saw in weekly movie\nnights in the dining hall, and the little map on which I traced its course with my\nfather, I would barely have known a war was going on. One Arab army did get\nnear to us: the Iraqis, in Qaqun. If they had advanced a few miles further, they\ncould have overrun Mishmar Hasharon, reached the coast and cut the new\nJewish state in half. I can still remember the rumble of what sounded like\nthunder one morning in June 1948, as the Alexandronis, one of the twelve\nbrigades in the new Israeli army, launched their decisive attack on the Iraqis.\n\n29\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_011500\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

He laughed. “Not like you, Vicky,” was his riposte.\n\nI remembered that when we’d once discussed math—in particular, an isosceles triangle—and I revealed I\nhadn’t studied math since I was 14 (such is, or was, the way of the British educational system), I received a\npackage at home via messenger.

Because if one thing’s for sure: When it comes to international business, Jeffrey knows what\nhe’s talking about far more than “Andy” does. Which is why Leon Black, Mort Zuckerman and a few other\nfinanciers hang out with him.\n\nAnd Ghislaine?\nFull disclosure: I like her. Most people in New York do. It’s almost impossible not to.\n\nShe is always the most interesting, the most vivacious, the most unusual person in any room. I’ve spent hours\ntalking to her about the third world at a bar until 2am. She is as passionate as she is knowledgeable. She is\ncurious. She has spent weeks at the bottom of the ocean, literally going deeper than anyone else. She has sent\nmea DVD of the fish there. Her rolodex would blow away almost anyone else’s I can think of—probably even\nRupert Murdochs’. She is very well-read and can talk about most things for hours. She is passionate about Bill\nClinton with whom she is close friends.\n\nYet, touchingly, when she had to give a speech at the 40th birthday party of her best friend, Ariadne Calvo-\nPlatero, (known fondly to her close friends as “the Tennis Goddess”) Ghislaine shook a little with nerves. When\nit comes down to things she really cares about—and Ariadne is one of them—Ghislaine shows her\nvulnerability.\n\nAnd that vulnerability is key to understanding her friendship with Jeffrey.\n\n“He saved her,” I remember a close friend of mine telling me. “When her father died, she was a wreck;\ninconsolable. And then Jeffrey took her in. She’s never forgotten that—and never will.”\n\nIn many ways, the socially awkward Epstein with his big house, plane, island and ranch was the perfect\nreplacement for her father, the late Robert Maxwell, newspaper tycoon and criminal. Sure, Jeffrey had his\nsexual pecadillos, but then Ghislaine’s father was not without his oddities. After all, 1t was he who died leaving\na massive “black hole” he’d fraudulently created. To Ghislaine, Jeffrey’s habits may not have seemed that\nstrange.\n\nIn fact, she probably figured, rather like I have, after years of writing about he very rich, that most successful\npeople in the end either have some weird habit (the late Bruce Wasserstein had the weight issues, the girl issues,\nand moved countries to avoid paying tax), or they break the law (Sam Waksal, Martha Stewart.) You don’t\ntend to get to the top by being the world’s most balanced human being. Even the folksy Warren Buffett didn’t\nquite manage a normal life—whatever that is. He had a second “wife” for many years whose existence he has\nbeen open about.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_030579\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

Who should deem “such decisions . . . acceptable”? Even\nif future powers decide to help humans survive and flourish, how will we find meaning\nand purpose in our lives if we aren’t needed for anything?\n\nThe debate about the societal impact of AI has changed dramatically in the last\nfew years. In 2014, what little public talk there was of AI risk tended to be dismissed as\nLuddite scaremongering, for one of two logically incompatible reasons:\n\n(1) AGI was overhyped and wouldn’t happen for at least another century.\n\n(2) AGI would probably happen sooner but was virtually guaranteed to be\nbeneficial.\n\nToday, talk of AI’s societal impact is everywhere, and work on AI safety and AI\nethics has moved into companies, universities, and academic conferences. The\ncontroversial position on AI safety research is no longer to advocate for it but to dismiss\nit. Whereas the open letter that emerged from the 2015 Puerto Rico AI conference (and\nhelped mainstream AI safety) spoke only in vague terms about the importance of keeping\nAI beneficial, the 2017 Asilomar AI Principles (see below) had real teeth: They explicitly\nmention recursive self-improvement, superintelligence, and existential risk, and were\nsigned by AI industry leaders and over a thousand AI researchers from around the world.\n\nNonetheless, most discussion is limited to the near-term impact of narrow AI and\nthe broader community pays only limited attention to the dramatic transformations that\nAGI may soon bring to life on Earth. Why?\n\nWhy we’re rushing to make ourselves obsolete, and why we avoid talking about it\n\nFirst of all, there’s simple economics. Whenever we figure out how to make another type\nof human work obsolete by building machines that do it better and cheaper, most of\nsociety gains: Those who build and use the machines make profits, and consumers get\nmore affordable products. This will be as true of future investor AGIs and scientist AGIs\nas it was of weaving machines, excavators, and industrial robots. In the past, displaced\nworkers usually found new jobs, but this basic economic incentive will remain even if\nthat is no longer the case. The existence of affordable AGI means, by definition,\n\nthat all jobs can be done more cheaply by machines, so anyone claiming that “people will\nalways find new well-paying jobs” is in effect claiming that AI researchers will fail to\nbuild AGI.\n\nSecond, Homo sapiens is by nature curious, which will motivate the scientific\nquest for understanding intelligence and developing AGI even without economic\nincentives. Although curiosity is one of the most celebrated human attributes, it can\ncause problems when it fosters technology we haven’t yet learned how to manage wisely.\nSheer scientific curiosity without profit motive contributed to the discovery of nuclear\nweapons and tools for engineering pandemics, so it’s not unthinkable that the old adage\n“Curiosity killed the cat” will turn out to apply to the human species as well.\n\nThird, we’re mortal. This explains the near unanimous support for developing\nnew technologies that help us live longer, healthier lives, which strongly motivates\ncurrent AI research. AGI can clearly aid medical research even more. Some thinkers\neven aspire to near immortality via cyborgization or uploading.\n\nWe’re thus on the slippery slope toward AGI, with strong incentives to keep\nsliding downward, even though the consequence will by definition be our economic\nobsolescence. We will no longer be needed for anything, because all jobs can be done\n\n65\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_016868\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

One way to deal with this problem is to describe implicit knowledge using language and\nmethods typically reserved for explicit knowledge. This might seem intrinsically non-workable,\nbut we argue that it actually makes a lot of sense. The same sort of networks that a system like\nCogPrime uses to represent knowledge explicitly, can also be used to represent the emergent\nknowledge that implicitly exists in an intelligent system’s complex structures and dynamics.\n\nWe've noted that CogPrime uses an explicit representation of knowledge in terms of weighted\nlabeled hypergraphs; and also uses other more neural net like mechanisms (e.g. the economic\nattention allocation network subsystem) to represent knowledge globally and implicitly. Cog-\nPrime combines these two sorts of representation according to the principle we have called\nglocality. In this chapter we pursue glocality a bit further — describing a means by which even\nimplicitly represented knowledge can be modeled using weighted labeled hypergraphs similar to\nthe ones used explicitly in CogPrime. This is conceptually important, in terms of making clear\nthe fundamental similarities and differences between implicit and explicit knowledge represen-\ntation; and it is also pragmatically meaningful due to its relevance to the CogPrime methods\ndescribed in Chapter 42 of Part 2 that transform implicit into explicit knowledge.\n\nTo avoid confusion with CogPrime’s explicit knowledge representation, we will refer to the\nhypergraphs in this chapter as composed of Vertices and Edges rather than Nodes and Links. In\nprior publications we have referred to \"derived\" or \"emergent\" hypergraphs of the sort described\nhere using the acronym SMEPH, which stands for Self-Modifying, Evolving Probabilistic Hy-\npergraphs.\n\n14.2 Key Vertex and Edge Types\n\nWe begin by introducing a particular collection of Vertex and Edge types, to be used in modeling\nthe internal structures of intelligent systems.\nThe key SMEPH Vertex types are\n\n271\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_013187\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

But in talking with his wartime friends, he realized this kind of\nlow-level intelligence could never address the real need for Israel: to ensure we\nhad early warning if Syria or Lebanon, Jordan or Egypt, were preparing to go to\nwar against us.\n\nHe began toying with the idea of training a small force of Israeli soldiers to\ngo on cross-border intelligence missions. The initial response from the kirya —\nmilitary headquarters in Tel Aviv — was so frustrating that anyone else would\nhave given up. None of the generals saw any reason to believe his scheme\nwould work. But the real obstacle was their continuing trauma over what had\nhappened the last time Israeli soldiers crossed the border on an intelligence\nmission. It had happened in 1954, and it ended in a failure even more serious\nthan Rotem. The target was the Golan Heights, inside Syria. The special\ntechnology unit attached to military intelligence had developed a bugging\ndevice designed to be placed on a telephone pole on the Golan. The task of\ninstalling it was given to the most decorated, and respected, commando unit in\nthe army: Company A in Sharon’s paratroop battalion, led by its commander,\nMeir Har-Zion.\n\nOn a spring night in 1954, Har-Zion led his team onto the Golan. They\nrigged the bugging unit to the telephone pole, buried the bulky transmitter and\nmade their way back. And it worked. Israeli intelligence could listen in to\nmilitary communications on the Heights. The hitch as that the batteries had to\nbe replaced every few weeks. Several more times, Meir and his men sneaked\nback into Syria to keep the bug working. But as commander of Company A,\nMeir was a key part of Israel’s anti-fedayeen operations. The last thing Moshe\nDayan wanted to risk was seeing him captured while trying to replace a few\nbatteries. So he shifted the task to a regular unit from the Golani Brigade.\n\nIn December 1954, a handover mission was organized. Three men from\nCompany A, including one of Meir’s sergeants, joined three from the Golani\nBrigade. But they didn’t even hold a joint exercise before setting off. There was\nalso a lack of clarity about who was in charge. Though the Golani commander\nwas nominally the senior officer, only the Company A men had any first-hand\nexperience of this kind of mission. A half-mile onto the Heights, they were\nintercepted by a Syrian soldiers. If this had been a Company A operation, the\nresponse would have been automatic. They would have wheeled, opened fire\nand attacked. But when the Syrians ordered the Golanis to drop their weapons,\none of them did, and the Company A men followed suit. They were all taken to\nDamascus, held in solitary confinement, beaten and tortured.\n\no/7\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_011528\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

The Court\njudged DOMA for its impact on “over\n1,000 federal statutes and the whole\nrealm of federal regulations.” Very little\nwas said specifically about federal tax law\nbeyond that. Nevertheless, the federal tax\nlaw is clearly among those “federal stat-\nutes and regulations” impacted most di-\nrectly by the Supreme Court’ holding.\n\nIMPACT. Same-sex couples who were mar-\nried under state law for years prior to 2013\nnow need to decide whether to amend those\nprior-year returns still open under the Codes\nstatute of limitations, to reflect a change\nfrom unmarried to married filing status.\nSame-sex married couples also should con-\nsider updating their estate plans, based upon\nthe estate and gift tax impact of Windsor.\n\nINCOME TAX BENEFITS\nAND DISADVANTAGES\n\nBecause of the Supreme Court's decision, the\nsame tax benefits and disadvantages faced by\njust-married, opposite-sex couples—in chang-\ning from filing as separate, unmarried indi-\nviduals to filing as married filing jointly (or\nmarried filing separately)—are now shared by\nsame-sex married couples. Likewise, however,\nthose same-sex couples not married under\nstate law continue to be subject to the same\ndisadvantages and benefits, and face many of\nthe same strategic decisions, as unmarried het-\nerosexual couples under the federal tax law.\n\nCAUTION. As mentioned, above, reso-\nlution is pending on the issue of whether\nrecognition or non-recognition of a same-\nsex marriage in the State in which the\nsame-sex couple currently reside controls\nwhether the IRS will treat the couple as\nmarried for federal tax purposes. Most\nfederal agencies have defined marriage in\nthe past based on a couple’ residency and\nnot where they were married.\n\nFILING STATUS\n\nA taxpayer's filing status depends in large\npart—if not exclusively in most cases—on\n\nthe taxpayer’s marital status. Taxpayers may\nbe single, surviving spouse, head of house-\nhold, married filing joint returns, or married\nfiling separately. Filing status, in turn, deter-\nmines the right to many tax benefits, both in\nterms of access and amount. Income tax rate\nbracket levels, the standard deduction, per-\nsonal exemptions, and the adjusted gross in-\ncome (AGI) amounts at which many tax ben-\nefits “phaseout” all hinge upon filing status.\n\nJoint Return Status. Because of the Supreme\nCourts Windsor decision, same-sex couples who\ncurrently are married under state law are presum-\nably now also barred for federal tax purposes from\nfiling separate returns as unmarried (or as head of\nhousehold, in most cases); they must file either\njointly or married filing separately for 2013 (un-\nless they are divorced or have a final separation\nagreement in place by the end of 2013). The\ngeneral rule that has always applied to filing sta-\ntus now presumably applies to same-sex married\nstatus as well: an individual’s filing status is de-\ntermined for the entire year based upon marital\nstatus on December 31* of that year. The IRS is\nexpected to issue guidance in this area.\n\nIMPACT. Leading up to the Supreme\nCourts decision, many same-sex couples\nfiled protective income tax refund claims\nusing married filing jointly status. A pro-\ntective refund claim is a claim filed to\nprotect the taxpayers right to a potential\nrefund based on a contingent event for\na taxable period for which the period of\nlimitations is about to expire. Now that\nthe Supreme Courts decision is out, full\nrefund claims, rather than protective\nclaims, should be filed going forward.\n\nCOMMENT. Under current rules, a tax-\npayer can sign a joint return if his or her\nspouse is serving in a combat zone. In other\nlimited cases where one spouse cannot sign\nthe joint return, such as because of injury or\nillness, the other spouse may sign the return\nand attach a statement explaining why the\nspouse was unable to sign. Same-sex couples\nwho are married under state law are now\n\npresumably allowed these signing benefits.\n\nCOMMENT. Because same-sex marriage\nis relatively new, the tax implications\n\nof divorce of a same-sex couple are only\nstarting to manifest themselves.\n\nThe Marriage Penalty. Same-sex married\ncouples who have been denied joint re-\nturn status under the federal tax laws prior\nto the Supreme Court's Windsor decision\nnow need to investigate the effect of joint\nreturn status, both for returns that will be\nfiled in the future and for prior year returns\nstill open within the statute of limitations\nrefund-claim period (generally, but not al-\nways, three years from filing — see this Brief-\ning, below, for a discussion of this deadline).\n\nThe benefits of filing a joint return may\nnot always be greater than filing separately\nas unmarried individuals. Both differences\nin tax rate bracket amounts and a variety of\nincome floors and thresholds used to deter-\nmine the right to certain tax breaks come\ninto play in determining whether some\nsame-sex couples were better off, income\ntax-wise, before the Supreme Court’s deci-\nsion; and what they should do now.\n\nIMPACT. Individuals in a relationship\nwho are not married and who each re-\nalize approximately the same level of\n\nNO NATIONWIDE\nEXTENSION OF SAME-\nSEX MARRIAGE\n\n‘The Supreme Court struck down Section\n3 of DOMA, which defined marriage as\na legal union between one man and one\nwoman as husband and wife and de-\nfined spouse as only a person of the op-\nposite sex who is a husband or wife. The\nSupreme Court did not strike down Sec-\ntion 2 of DOMA, which provides that\nno state, territory or possession of the\nUnited States shall be required to give\neffect to any marriage between persons\nof the same sex under the laws of any\nother such jurisdiction or to any right\nor claim arising from such relationship.\nSection 2 was not challenged and, there-\nfore, was not at issue in Windsor.\n\nCCH Tax Briefing\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_029307\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

We stay overweight Japanese\nequities and grow wary of the short yen trade, as capital inflows and rising growth expectations (chart of right) are ultimately bullish\nfor the currency. Watch next week’s BoJ meeting, led by newly appointed Governor Kuroda, for new reflationary measures.\n\ne The Euro area economy remains in recession, while policy makers are making little effort to reverse the contraction. We monitor\nsigns of any large deposit flight post Cyprus over coming weeks and months to judge whether the bailout may actually be worsening\nconditions in the Euro. Economic forecast momentum remains negative (chart of right). These are good reasons to underweight the\nEuro area, if not all of Europe, across asset classes, against the rest of the world.\n\ne The US, in contrast, is seeing better spending from both corporates and consumers than we could have expected post Fiscal Cliff\nand sequestration. But given the huge amount of fiscal drag, which is a fact, we want to see another 1-2 months of data before\nextrapolating the good news. It did support US equities in recent weeks, which continue to benefit from US corporates issuing debt to\nbuy their own shares and others', through M&A. This corporate rotation from debt to equities is almost exclusively a US flow, which\nhelps explain US equity outperformance.\n\ne Across risk assets, we are similarly seeing huge delinking, with equities rallying greatly and commodities and credit secing no\ngains (chart p. 1), very much unlike last year. Commodities are delinking as there are no growth upgrades in EM, and inflation\nconcerns are concentrated on two countries, UK and Japan. Credit is delinking as most investors are massively overweight credit\nversus equities, as evidenced by the disparity in buying flows in 2011-12. Relevering by US corporate and the Fed debating the end of\nQE are signaling that the 3-decade long rally in bonds ts likely over. Investors are starting to dollar-average away from bonds to\nequities.\n\nFixed Income\n\n¢ Bonds rallied again, except for Euro area peripherals, the source of this week’s market concerns. The imposition of capital controls\non Cypriot deposits is to be sure a watershed moment, but for now not one we expect to spark significant deposit withdrawals\nelsewhere. Meanwhile, the most likely outcome to the Italian impasse appears to be new elections in the autumn. With seemingly little\nprospect of a material rise in yields on the safest assets, we think the search for carry evident across the full gamut of asset markets\nwill see peripheral spreads narrow over time.\n\ne Ten-year JGB yields have rallied to within a few bps of their all-time low, ahead of next week’s inaugural meeting for the new BoJ\nleadership. We do indeed expect aggressive easing, with JGB purchases out to 30 years, but think this will be trumped by profit taking\nin JGBs after the fiscal year end.\n\ne Our latest Inflation Expectations Survey (F. Diamond, K. Gupta) was out yesterday. One interesting result is that almost 90% of\nrespondents believe the BoJ has less than a 50/50 shot of hitting its 2% inflation target in two years, a reflection of the formidable\nchallenge of sparking inflation expectations after two decades of falling prices.\n\nEquities\n\ne The global rally in equity markets slowed this week, but did not reverse, on continued concerns about the fallout from a poorly\nexecuted Cyprus solution. The Euro area underperformed again, for a second week ina row. As discussed last week, we view Cyprus\nas a local problem that we address by underweighting Euro area equities in a global portfolio. A potential negative feedback loop\nfrom markets to the economy poses a serious downside risk for Euro area growth over coming months prolonging the current run of\nnegative economic surprises from the region.\n\ne Japan is the region we like the most. In our mind the Japanese equity trade has further legs not only due to prospective BoJ balance\nsheet expansion but more importantly due to a reform agenda to be unveiled into the summer.\n\ne EM equities are suffering from renewed policy tightening in major EM economies such as Brazil and China. Investors have bitter\nmemories of previous property tightening measures in China. As within DM, we see a lot of divergences within EM and prefer to\nfocus on under-owned markets with good domestic demand story such as Mexico and Malaysia. See “Consensus Asset Allocation”,\nAdrian Mowat and team, Mar 26th. Open overweights in Mexican and Malaysia equities vs MSCI EM.\n\ne For long-term investors we just released our quarterly publication \"Trade opportunities for long term investors\" Mar 27. We\nmonetize risk premia in Value stocks via a long in S&P500 Value vs S&P500 ETFs. It appears that a five year long underperformance\nof Value stocks has come to an end. We take profit on trades that monetize skew risk premia in S&P500 due to sharp contraction over\nthe past quarter. We continue to monetize equity risk premia via buying high dividend yield equity ETFs against USTs. Our\npreference is to buy ETFs which track the S&P US Preferred stock due to its high yield, around 6%, and its high weight on Financials.\n\nCredit\n\ne The news flow from the Cypriot bailout continued to push spreads wider and vol higher this week, with European Financials\nunderperforming as creditor bail-in risks returned to the forefront. iTraxx senior and subordinated financials indices widened 20bp as\ninvestors sought to hedge via CDS rather than sell bonds. European credit continued to underperformed US credit.\n\ne The fact that Cypriot banks debt is only 1.3% of total liabilities was a key factor in the decision to bail-in depositors. Yet events\nsurrounding the banking sector restructuring also suggest that keeping senior unsecured bondholders immune from costly bail-\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_031115\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

There was some feeling that Trump\nwas returning to scenes of past success: the 7imes might be against him, but Haberman\nhad worked at the New York Post for many years. “She’s very professional,” Conway said,\nspeaking in defense of the president and trying to justify Haberman’s extraordinary access.\nBut however intent he remained on getting good ink in the Zimes, the president saw\nHaberman as “mean and horrible.” And yet, on a near-weekly basis, he and Hicks plotted\nwhen next to have the Zimes come in.\n\nOOK Ok\n\nKushner had his personal press operation and Bannon had his.

GEFFNER AND YEHUDA BRAUNSTEIN\n\nReprinted with permission of Hedgeweek\n\nWith the Trump administration in the White House,\nregulatory uncertainty permeates the financial\nservices industry. While many on Wall Street are\nvery excited by the Trump presidency, others are\napproaching this new era with trepidation. Presi-\ndent Trump is unpredictable in many ways, and the\nindustry eagerly awaits his actions hoping that the\nfinancial markets do not respond negatively and\ncreate chaos in the global marketplace.\n\nWhile we should expect that the Trump administration\nwill aim to cut back financial regulation implemented\nduring the last eight years, it is unrealistic to expect\nthat these laws will be eliminated in their entirety.\nThough the financial markets have been extremely\nvolatile of late and react very swiftly upon the\nannouncement of any meaningful global news, vari-\nous aspects of recent financial regulation have been\npositive for the industry. For example, the requirement\nfor many investment advisers to register with the U.S.\nSecurities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), one\nof the requirements of The Dodd—Frank Wall Street\nReform and Consumer Protection Act (“Dodd Frank”)\nwhich was signed into federal law by President\nObama to be effective as of July 21, 2010, in retro-\nspect, has been viewed as a positive change within\nthe industry. Understandably, when initially intro-\nduced in 2010, many asset managers located within\nthe United States and abroad that were required to\nregister as investment advisers with the SEC as a\nresult of Dodd-Frank were opposed to the changes.\nHowever, many advisers, investors and regulators\nnow agree that requiring a larger number of advisers\nto be accountable to higher regulatory standards has\ncreated an environment where investors and coun-\nterparties have more confidence in the oversight of\nthose managers and the industry as a whole.\n\nIt is also important to remember that any time\nthe government or a regulator changes the laws,\nrules or regulations, those businesses affected\nincur capital and opportunity costs in connection\nwith analyzing the changes in law and implement-\ning operational changes to comply with the new\n\nlaws. For example, when Dodd-Frank was origi-\nnally enacted, at the time of registration, those\ninvestment advisers that were required to register\nas advisers with the SEC were required to adopt\nwritten policies and procedures and invested capi-\ntal into their operations and technology to support\ncompliance. Therefore, we expect that caution will\nbe exercised before significant change is made to\navoid the various costs associated with imple-\nmenting change. A case in point is the new DOL\nRule (discussed earlier in this newsletter), origi-\nnally set to take effect on April 10, 2017. Invest-\nment advisers impacted by the DOL Rule, have\nalready been forced to analyze the DOL Rule and\nits impact on their businesses, and some advisers\nhave already begun to implement changes to their\noperations and procedures. The DOL Rule has been\nthe subject of much debate. While some industry\nexperts believe that the DOL Rule is onerous and\nmaterially increases the costs associated with\nproviding services to clients, supporters of the\nDOL Rule believe that it is necessary to protect\ninvestors against brokers who are unnecessarily\nselling high-fee investments to their clients. On\nFebruary 3, 2017, President Trump signed a memo-\nrandum to delay the DOL Rule by six (6)-months.\nOn March 1, 2017, the DOL issued a proposed\nrule, which will extend the applicability date of its\nfiduciary rule, including the Best Interest Contract\nExemption, from April 10, 2017 to June 9, 2017, a\n60-day delay. If the DOL Rule is ultimately modi-\nfied or even eliminated, some advisers may have to\nreverse their recently-implemented changes.\n\nIn conclusion, we do not believe that regulations\nin the financial industry will be eliminated in their\nentirety. For example, if the requirement to register\nas an investment adviser with the SEC is materially\nmodified or no longer required, we expect that many\ninvestment advisers would maintain their registra-\ntion as it is perceived to be a competitive advantage\ncompared to those managers that are not registered.\nWhile we expect the Trump administration to improve\nthe financial services industry by having more bal-\n\nanced regulations, we believe that this administration\nwill quickly realize that there are a lot of reasonable\nand sensible regulations currently in place that are\nworking well, and that eliminating rules wholesale\ncan create chaos in the financial markets and may\ncome at a high price to their constituents.\n\nRon S.

Unlike\nopposite-sex couples, for example, there are\nno survivor benefits for the surviving spouse\nof a same-sex married couple. Also, the di-\nvorced spouse of a formerly married same-\nsex couple cannot not claim benefits based\non the earnings of his or her ex-spouse.\n\nIMPACT. The Social Security Adminis-\ntration (SSA) has based federal rights to\nbenefits on whether marital rights exist\nin the couples current state of residence\nrather than the state in which they were\nmarried. The impact of Windsor on the\nmanner in which federal agencies will\ntreat Social Security benefits remains to\nbe sorted out.\n\nWhen an individual\n\ndies, his or her surviving spouse may be\n\nSurvivor Benefits.\n\neligible for Social Security benefits if the\nsurviving spouse is age 60 or older, age 50\nor older and disabled, or any age if he or\nshe is caring for the decedent’s child who is\nyounger than age 16 or disabled and enti-\ntled to Social Security benefits on the record\nof the deceased individual. With DOMA\nhaving been struck down, survivor benefits\npreviously available only to opposite-sex\nmarried couples are now presumably avail-\nable to same-sex married couples. The SSA\nis expected to provide guidance.\n\nDivorced Spouses. If an individual is di-\nvorced, his or her ex-spouse may qualify\nfor Social Security benefits based on that\nindividual’s earnings. Generally, a divorced\nspouse must have been married to the in-\ndividual for at least 10 years and have been\ndivorced at least two years. Additionally,\nthe divorced spouse must be at least age\n62, unmarried and ineligible for an equal\nor greater benefit based on his or her own\nearnings or the earnings of someone else.\n‘These benefits are now presumably available\nto divorced individuals who were previously\nin a same-sex marriage. The SSA is expected\nto provide guidance.\n\nDeath Benefits. The SSA pays a one-\ntime death benefit of $255 to the dece-\ndent’s surviving spouse in an opposite-sex\nmarriage or minor child. The SSA will\npresumably now pay the one-time death\nbenefit to the surviving spouse in a same-\nsex marriage.\n\nEFFECTIVE-DATE ISSUES\n\nDetermination of the effective date for ap-\nplying the Supreme Court's holding to fed-\neral tax law is not straightforward in all cases\nand will necessitate further guidance from\nthe IRS. Same-sex married couples who\nwere not considered married under federal\nlaw prior to the Supreme Court decision\nare presumably not just considered married\nstarting on the date of the Supreme Court’s\ndecision, June 26, 2013 but are considered\nmarried retroactively to the date of their\nmarriage pursuant to state law. This retro-\nactive effective date raises a number of im-\nmediate federal tax issues:\n\nm Should same-sex couples now file\namended returns claiming joint return\nstatus?\n\nm Are same-sex couples now required to\namend past-year returns for joint status\neven if they did better tax-wise overall\nby filing separately as unmarried indi-\nviduals?\n\nm Will the IRS consider the Supreme\nCourt’s decision in determining marital\nstatus when auditing prior-year returns?\n\nAmended Joint Returns/Claims For Re-\nfund. Amended returns are filed to correct\nerrors made on previous returns. Although\nthe Internal Revenue Code does not specifi-\ncally permit amended returns, the IRS usu-\nally accepts them. But while the IRS’s dis-\ncretion to accept or reject amended returns\nhas been recognized, courts have required\nthe IRS to accept amended returns where\nits rejection of them has been found to be\narbitrary and unjust.\n\nLimitations Period. The statute of limita-\ntions for amending or auditing a return is\n\nSTATES THAT\nRECOGNIZE SAME-SEX\nMARRIAGE\n\nConnecticut\n\nDelaware(1)\n\nlowa\n\nMaine\n\nMaryland\n\nMassachusetts\n\nMinnesota(2)\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nNew York\n\nRhode Island(2)\n\nVermont\n\nWashington\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\n*As of June 27, 2013\n\n(1) Effective July 1, 2013\n\n(2) Effective August 1, 2013\n\nNote: California granted marriage li-\ncenses to same-sex couples from June\n16, 2008 to November 5, 2008.\nNote: The Little Traverse Bay Bands of\nOdawa Indians in Michigan, the Coquille\nNative American Nation in Oregon and\nthe Suquamish Native American Nation in\nWashington recognize same-sex marriage.\nNote: 37 States have laws expressly\nrestricting marriage to opposite-sex\ncouples.\n\nSTATES THAT\nRECOGNIZE SAME-SEX\nUNIONS/DOMESTIC\nPARTNERSHIPS\n\nCalifornia\nColorado\nHawaii\nIllinois\nNevada\nNew Jersey\nOregon\nWisconsin\n\ngenerally three years from the filing date or\ntwo years from the date taxes are paid, which-\never is later.

Ultimately, the court held that “[bJecause the\ngovernment has failed to show with reasonable particularity that it knew of the existence and\nlocation of most of the subpoenaed documents . . . Ponds’ act of production was sufficiently\ntestimonial to implicate his right against self-incrimination under the Fifth Amendment to the\nConstitution.” Id. at 316.\n\nB. Because the Committee’s subpoena fails to demonstrate with reasonable\nparticularity prior knowledge of the requested documents, General Flynn’s act\nof production would be testimonial in nature.\n\nThe great breadth of the Committee’s subpoena to General Flynn suggests that his act of\nproducing the requested documents, if they even exist, would be testimonial in nature, given\nthat the Committee has not demonstrated knowledge of the “existence, possession, and\nauthenticity of the subpoenaed documents with reasonable particularity such that the\ncommunication inherent in the act of production can be considered a foregone conclusion.” Id.\nat 324.

However, when it comes to understanding the human\nmind, these two goals—accuracy and generalizability—have long been at odds with each\nother.\n\nAt the far extreme of generalizability are rational theories of cognition. These\ntheories describe human behavior as a rational response to a given situation. A rational\nactor strives to maximize the expected reward produced by a sequence of actions—an\nidea widely used in economics precisely because it produces such generalizable\npredictions about human behavior. For the same reason, rationality is the standard\nassumption in inverse-reinforcement-learning models that try to make inferences from\nhuman behavior—perhaps with the concession that humans are not perfectly rational\nagents and sometimes randomly choose to act in ways unaligned with or even opposed to\ntheir best interests.\n\nThe problem with rationality as a basis for modeling human cognition 1s that it is\nnot accurate. In the domain of decision making, an extensive literature—spearheaded by\nthe work of cognitive psychologists Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky—has\ndocumented the ways in which people deviate from the prescriptions of rational models.\nKahneman and Tversky proposed that in many situations people instead follow simple\nheuristics that allow them to reach good solutions at low cognitive cost but sometimes\nresult in errors. To take one of their examples, if you ask somebody to evaluate the\nprobability of an event, they might rely on how easy it is to generate an example of such\nan event from memory, consider whether they can come up with a causal story for that\nevent’s occurring, or assess how similar the event is to their expectations. Each heuristic\nis a reasonable strategy for avoiding complex probabilistic computations, but also results\nin errors. For instance, relying on the ease of generating an event from memory as a\nguide to its probability leads us to overestimate the chances of extreme (hence extremely\nmemorable) events such as terrorist attacks.\n\nHeuristics provide a more accurate model of human cognition but one that is not\neasily generalizable. How do we know which heuristic people might use in a particular\nsituation? Are there other heuristics they use that we just haven’t discovered yet?\nKnowing exactly how people will behave in a new situation is a challenge: Is this\nsituation one in which they would generate examples from memory, come up with causal\nstories, or rely on similarity?\n\nUltimately, what we need is a way to describe how human minds work that has\nthe generalizability of rationality and the accuracy of heuristics. One way to achieve this\ngoal is to start with rationality and consider how to take it in a more realistic direction. A\nproblem with using rationality as a basis for describing the behavior of any real-world\nagent is that, in many situations, calculating the rational action requires the agent to\npossess a huge amount of computational resources. It might be worth expending those\nresources 1f you’re making a highly consequential decision and have a lot of time to\nevaluate your options, but most human decisions are made quickly and for relatively low\nstakes. In any situation where the time you spend making a decision is costly—at the\nvery least because it’s time you could spend doing something else—the classic notion of\nrationality is no longer a good prescription for how one should behave.\n\nTo develop a more realistic model of rational behavior, we need to take into\n\n94\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_016897\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

Following an internship at\nGeorgetown, he completed Neurology and Nuclear Medicine\ntraining at UCLA and joined the faculty here in 1983.\n\nDr. Mazziotta chairs one of the nation’s largest\nNeurology departments, which for nine of the last ten\nyears achieved the distinguished position of being first in\nNational Institutes of Health (NIH) research funding. An\nexpert in brain imaging, he established the Brain Mapping\nCenter at UCLA that includes all of the methods available\nto study human brain structure and function. He was the\nprincipal investigator of the International Consortium for\nBrain Mapping, whose goal is to develop the first atlas of\nthe human brain that will include behavioral, demographic,\nimaging, and genetic data from 7,000 subjects.\n\nSince beginning this work, Dr. Mazziotta has\npublished more than 255 research papers and eight texts.\nHe has received numerous awards and honors, including\nthe Oldendorf Award from the American Society of\nNeuroimaging, the S.

He is the younger brother of John\nNegroponte, former United States Deputy Secretary of State.\nHe attended Buckley School in New York City, Le\nRosey in Switzerland, and The Choate School (now Choate\nRosemary Hall) in Wallingford, Connecticut, from which he\ngraduated in 1961. Subsequently, he studied at MIT as both\nan undergraduate and graduate student in Architecture where\nhis research focused on issues of computer-aided design. He\nearned a Master’s degree in architecture from MIT in 1966.\nNegroponte joined the faculty of MIT in 1966.\nFor several years thereafter he divided his teaching time\nbetween MIT and several visiting professorships at Yale,\nMichigan and the University of California, Berkeley.\nIn 1967, Negroponte founded MIT’s Architecture\nMachine Group, a combination lab and think tank which\nstudied new approaches to human-computer interaction.\nIn 1985, Negroponte created the MIT Media Lab with\nJerome B. Wiesner. As director, he developed the lab into\nthe pre-eminent computer science laboratory for new\nmedia and a high-tech playground for investigating the\nhuman-computer interface. Negroponte also became a\nproponent of intelligent agents and personalized electronic\nnewspapers, for which he popularized the term the Daily Me.\nIn 1992, Negroponte became involved in the creation\nof Wired Magazine as the first investor. From 1993 to 1998,\nhe contributed a monthly column to the magazine in which\nhe reiterated a basic theme: “Move bits, not atoms.”\nNegroponte expanded many of the ideas from his\nWired columns into a bestselling book Being Digital (1995),\nwhich made famous his forecasts on how the interactive\nworld, the entertainment world and the information world\nwould eventually merge. Being Digital was a bestseller and\nwas translated into some twenty languages. Negroponte\nis a digital optimist who believed that computers would\nmake life better for everyone. However, critics such as\nCass Sunstein have faulted his techno-utopian ideas for\nfailing to consider the historical, political and cultural\nrealities with which new technologies should be viewed.\nNegroponte’s belief that wired technologies such\nas telephones will ultimately become unwired by using\nairwaves instead of wires or fiber optics, and that unwired\ntechnologies such as televisions will become wired, is\ncommonly referred to as the Negroponte switch.\n\nIn 2000, Negroponte stepped down as director\nof the Media Lab as Walter Bender took over as Executive\nDirector. However, Negroponte retained the role of laboratory\nChairman. When Frank Moss was appointed director of the lab\nin 2006, Negroponte stepped down as lab chairman to focus\nmore fully on his work with One Laptop Per Child (OLPC)\nalthough he retains his appointment as professor at MIT.\n\nIn November 2005, at the World Summit on the\nInformation Society held in Tunis, Negroponte unveiled the\nconcept of a $100 laptop computer, The Children’s Machine,\ndesigned for students in the developing world. The price\nhas increased to US$180, however. The project is part of\na broader program by One Laptop Per Child, a non-profit\norganisation started by Negroponte and other Media Lab\nfaculty, to extend Internet access in developing countries.\n\nNegroponte is an active angel investor and has\ninvested in over 30 startup companies over the last 30 years,\nincluding Zagats, Wired, Ambient Devices, Skype and Velti.\nHe sits on several boards, including Motorola (listed on the\nNew York Stock Exchange) and Velti (listed on the London\nStock Exchange and the NASDAQ). He is also on the advisory\nboard of TTI/Vanguard. In August 2007, he was appointed\nto a five-member special committee with the objective of\nassuring the continued journalistic and editorial integrity\nand independence of the Wall Street Journal and other Dow\nJones & Company publications and services. The committee\nwas formed as part of the merger of Dow Jones with News\nCorporation. Negroponte’s fellow founding committee\nmembers are Louis Boccardi, Thomas Bray, Jack Fuller,\nand the late former Congresswoman Jennifer Dunn.\n\nNegroponte has influenced modern\n\nday futurists, such as David Houle.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_017551\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

The overall concept of glocal memory should not be considered as restricted to\nthis particular model. This model is not intended for maximal generality, but is intended to\nencompass a variety of current AI system designs and formal neurological models.\n\nIn this model, we will consider S’s memory subsystem as a set of objects we’ll call “tokens,”\nembedded in some metric space. The metric in the space, which we will call the “basic distance”\nof the memory, generally will not be defined in terms of the semantics of the items stored in the\nmemory; though it may come to shape these dynamics through the specific architecture and\nevolution of the memory. Note that these tokens are not intended as generally being mapped\none-to-one onto meaningful items stored in the memory. The “tokens” are the raw materials\nthat the memory arranges in various patterns in order to store items.\n\nWe assume that each token, at each point in time, may meaningfully be assigned a certain\nquantitative “activation level.” Also, tokens may have other numerical or discrete quantities\nassociated with them, depending on the particular memory architecture. Finally, tokens may\nrelate other tokens, so that optionally a token may come equipped with an (ordered or un-\nordered) list of other tokens.\n\nTo understand the meaning of the activation levels, one should think about S’s memory\nsubsystem as being coupled with an action-selection subsystem, that dynamically chooses the\nactions to be taken by the overall system in which the two subsystems are embedded. Each\ncombination of actions, in each particular type of context, will generally be associated with the\nactivation of certain tokens in memory.\n\nThen, as analysts of the system S, we may associate each token T with an “activation vector”\nv(T,t), whose value for each discrete time ¢ consists of the activation of the token T at time t.\nSo, the 50’th entry of the vector corresponds to the activation of the token at the 50/th time\nstep.\n\n“Items stored in memory” over a certain period of time, may then be defined as clusters in\nthe set of activation vectors associated with memory during that period of time. Note that the\nsystem S itself may explicitly recognize and remember patterns regarding what items are stored\nin its memory — but, from an external analyst’s perspective, the set of items in S’s memory is\nnot restricted to the ones that S has explicitly recognized as memory items.\n\nThe “localization” of a memory item may be defined as the degree to which the various tokens\ninvolved in the item are close to each other according to the metric in the memory metric-space.\nThis degree may be formalized in various ways, but choosing a particular quantitative measure\nis not important here. A highly localized item may be called “local” and a not-very-localized\nitem may be called “global.”\n\nWe may define the “activation distance” of two tokens as the distance between their activation\nvectors. We may then say that a memory is “well aligned” to the extent that there is a correlation\nbetween the activation distance of tokens, and the basic distance of the memory metric-space.\n\nGiven the above set-up, the basic notion of glocal memory can be enounced fairly simply. A\nglocal memory is one:\n\ne that is reasonably well-aligned (i.e. the correlation between activation and basic distance is\nsignificantly greater than random)\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_013178\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

Wars are notorious for yielding unintended and unexpected\nconsequences; for reasons explained below, a war against Iran is even\nharder than usual to bound analytically.\n\nComplexity, Uncertainty and War\n\nOur first consideration in analyzing the likely course of war with Iran\nis that a U.S.-led attack would be merely the first phase of a war, the\nopening act of an extended drama whose scenes would unfold, not\naccording to any script, but to an emergent logic of its own. Given\nthe political context in which military engagement would rest, even a\nminor attack would likely become a major test of strength involving\nnot only the United States and Iran but also a host of allies and\nassociates. It is therefore disingenuous to try to frame military action\nagainst Iran as a simple “raid” or even a broader “operation.” We are\ntalking here about war, with attendant potential high costs to all\ncombatants in terms of military casualties, civilian damage and\neconomic disruption.\n\nAt least three concepts are key to any coherent discussion of a U.S.-\nIranian military engagement: complexity, uncertainty and war itself.\nBy complexity we mean the number of moving parts in a given\nsituation: actors, processes and the connections among them. By\nuncertainty we mean structural uncertainty—that is, not just\nignorance of the magnitudes of agreed casual factors, but the\nignorance of the causal factors themselves, and their mutual relations.\nFor example, not only may the U.S. government not know, say, the\ntechnical status of the Iranian nuclear program, or the actual state of\nreadiness of Iranian forces. It may not know (or worse, have wrong)\nthe decision-making and implementation protocols of the Iranian\ngovernment, how the Iranian people and military would react to an\nattack, what Tehran would ask its allies and proxies to do, and what\nin fact they will do.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_018104\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

In a democratic society, one who assumes to\nact for the citizens in an executive, legislative, or judicial capacity must expect that his\nofficial acts will be commented upon and criticized. Such criticism cannot, in my opinion,\nbe muzzled or deterred by the courts at the instance of public officials under the label of\nlibel.”\n\nSince I am a public figure under the law, I have been defamed on numerous occasions, especially\non the internet. The libels and slanders have been both personal and political. Although these\ndefamations were published with actual malice, I have not sued, though I have often been\ntempted. (I once threatened to sue when a journalist made up a false racist and sexist quotation\nand attributed it to me; the newspaper investigated, agreed with me and made a contribution to\nmy favorite charity).\n\nMany years after New York Times v. Sullivan, I myself was charged with defamation—indeed\ncriminal defamation—for exercising my own freedom of speech to criticize a judge for an opinion\nshe wrote. This certainly made me appreciate our First Amendment. Here is the story:\n\nOne day in my office I opened an envelope and saw a notice that an Italian prosecutor in the city\nof Turin had initiated a criminal investigation against me. I had no idea what she could be\nreferring to. The letter stated that I had committed the alleged act in the city of Turin on January\n27%, 2005. I checked my calendar and discovered that I was teaching students at Harvard Law\nSchool on that day and then attending a lecture by a prominent federal judge. I could not possibly\nhave been in Turin or engaged in any criminal act there. Yet I soon discovered that I was being\ncharged with criminal libel for statements I had made in an interview with an Italian journalist\nover the telephone. The journalist was in New York. I was sitting at my desk in Cambridge. But\nthe interview was published by the newspaper La Stampa in Turin on January 25\", 2005.\nAccordingly, the alleged criminal act had taken place in Turin, even though I had never set foot in\nthat city. Nor had I engaged in any act other than responding to questions and expressing my\nheartfelt views about a judge who had written a foolish and dangerous judicial opinion that ruled\nthat three men suspected of recruiting suicide bombers were “guerrillas” and therefore not\nterrorists, and not guilty.\n\nI characterized her opinion as a “Magna Carta for terrorism,” and instead of answering (or\nignoring) me, she filed criminal charges with the prosecutor who decided to open an investigation.\n\nAs far as I know, the charges against me are still pending in Italy. I have every intention to fight\nthem if it comes to that.\n\nA variation on the theme of defamation is ridicule. Cartoons and drawings have long been used to\nridicule the high and mighty. More recently photo-shopped pictures have superimposed the heads\nof public figures on the bodies of others to demean or insult them. In 1988, the Supreme Court\nruled that the Reverend Jerry Falwell could not sue Hustler Magazine for publishing a parody of\nthe well known Campari Liqueur ads in which a celebrity described “his first time.” The ad relies\non the obvious double-entendre on the first sexual and drinking experience. In the parody,\nFalwell is shown drinking and having sex with his mother—pretty disgusting!

When I awoke from my\ninduced state, I was alone in a different room. Not knowing at all what\nwent on but feeling a little better, I called in the nurse who looked\nthrough my charts and checked my vital signs. Then told me the doctor\nwould be in shortly to inform me of the conclusion to my illness.\n\nHe was a tall man with dark hair, and a hardened look about him\nobviously from his job and constantly seeing the worst horror stories man\ncould think of, he just bluntly told me | had miscarried in early stages of\npregnancy. | should be fine to go home as soon as my course of\nintravenous antibiotics was complete. The news sunk in fast and hit a\ndeep nerve. I waited for the doctor to close the curtain before I let out any\nemotion and cried for my disastrous lifestyle that was dragging me into a\nworld that I wanted to break out of. This reoccurring cycle of believing I\nneeded men like Jeffrey to succeed in my life was draining the last bits of\nsensitivity left in my heart. I was picked up by Jeffrey himself-who took\nthe doctor alone to the side of the busy hallway to have a private\nconversation about something. Jeffrey wasn’t comforting at all, instead he\nsent me back home to rest for a couple weeks, and | only fell deeper into\na depression, using all forms of self-medication to treat my sorrows.\n\nTwo weeks later, as if Jeffrey was trying to lighten my spirits, he told\nme I would be going to his island to meet a new client. He is a Harvard\nProfessor, named Stephen Kosslyn. I would be spending two days with\nhim showing him around the island, dining with him, and treating him to\na massage whenever he wanted. Without Jeffrey even verbalizing the\nneed to have sex with him, he told me to keep him happy like I had my\nfirst client. I packed my suitcase with island apparel, and kissed T.J good-\nbye, who had at least offered me a warm embrace upon the news of my\nmiscarriage but none other than that knowing it wasn’t his.\n\nStephen was a quirky little man with white hair and a mad scientist look\nabout him. We arrived separately and I greeted him when one of the\nhousekeepers picked him up from the airport and arrived by boat, instead\nof helicopter as Jeffrey and Ghislane often arrive on. We made our\nacquaintances and he looked as if he was tripping over himself with\nwords, obviously delighted with his company and location for the\nweekend. { showed him around as Jeffrey had asked and took him on an\nadventurous quad bike ride around the small curvy paths, leading the way\nand letting loose my hair, doing something that gave me a natural high\ninstead of the prescription one.

I didn’t feel as if\nlL owed this stranger anything but what was expected of me by Jeffrey and\nI could be polite, I just couldn’t be myself.\n\nWe got back to the main villa to see what time dinner would be served\nso we could have time to unpack and clean up beforehand. We both met\nat six pm for dinner on the outside veranda. He sat at the head of the\ntable and I sat next to him, politely folding my napkin to put in my lap.\nThe first time Jeffrey and Ghislane had seen me cut meat and eat with a\nfork and knife they were so appalled, making fun of my unsophisticated\nhabits. Ghislane took the fork and knife in her hands and proceeded to\nshow me how to politely cut my food and eat. Now that my mannerisms\nhad improved they wouldn’t have to be worried about my etiquette when\nsomeone important was around anyone. We both drank the red wine\nsupplied on the table and it seemed to warm me up on the breezy night.\nBy the time dinner was served and another red wine bottle later, he\nseemed to get funnier. | made fun of his tousled hair and he poked at me\nfor my skinny legs, calling me a wanna-be- anorexic. When dessert was\nbrought out, he asked if he could receive one of the delightful massages\nhe has been hearing about from Jeffrey. | gulped more red wine down and\nsweetly complied with his offer, dreading the moment I'd have to see his\nnaked body, let alone touch it. I asked the housekeeper Kathy that had\nbeen serving us that night to please have someone set up a massage bed\nin one of the cabana’s. | went to my room to down a few Xanax, telling\nhim I wanted to freshen up after dinner but to meet me in his cabana in\ntwenty minutes or so. | was ready to go as | had said, twenty minutes\nlater, with the effects of the tablets mixed with the red wine, and I would\nhe free not to feel anything. He was still dressed when { got in the cabana,\nobviously not accustomed to this and a lot shyer than what I had been\nused to, I told him he’d need to undress and lie face down on the table,\nputting a towel to cover his bare bottom to prevent him feeling\nembarrassed during the massage. I gave the massage my earnest as I\nalways had, and quickly got through having intercourse with him. Not\nwanting to make any foreplay or anything extravagant out of it, I let him\nthink that’s as good as it got, and by the smile on his face, J thought I had\ndone enough.\n\nThe next day I took him down to the beach for a real massage under a\ntiki-hut on the waters edge. It was one of Jeffrey’s favorite places to have\na massage, as he droned out to the sound of the waves and my gentle\ntherapeutic strokes. Afterwards we had lunch back at the main villa and\nwent back down to the beach to swim out to the water trampoline about\none hundred meters off the dock. He didn’t do any bouncing around or\nanything like that.

One of the officers was\n23-year-old Nir Poraz, whom I remembered from operational briefings in the\nkirya on previous sayeret missions. Wachsman was being held in a room on the\nfirst floor. The commandos would simultaneously detonate explosives on three\ndoors: at the front, on the side, and a third one leading through a kitchen to the\nroom where the kidnappers had their hostage. The attack began fifteen minutes\nbefore the Hamas deadline. The explosive charges went off, but only the one in\nthe front blew open the door. Poraz and his team rushed in, but one of the\nkidnappers opened fire, killing him and wounding six others. The other team\nhad by now made it to the first floor. But despite firing at the metal lock, they\nhad trouble getting the door to open. By the time they got in, Wachsman had\nbeen killed, shot in the neck and chest.\n\nI was in the command post a few hundred yards away. I called Rabin and\nthen went to see him in the kirya. The head of personnel for the army had gone\nto see the Wachsman family and break the news to them. Now, we had to tell\nthe country. Rabin and I appeared on television together. Rabin insisted —\nwrongly — on saying he bore full responsibility. What had gone wrong, I had\ntried to impress on him, was not the decision to attempt the rescue. It was the\nrescue itself. That was not his responsibility. It was mine.\n\nThe next day, I visited Wachsman’s parents, and tried to convey how painful\nthe failed rescue was to me, Rabin and every one else involved. I was inspired\nand humbled by their response. His father had told a reporter he wanted to\nconvey his condolences to the parents of Nir Poraz. “This added loss has shaken\nme terribly,” he said. He told me he also believed that the Prime Minister had\napproved the rescue using his best judgement on the information that he had\navailable.

In such a\nbroad and protracted contest, the United States might not enjoy a\nfavorable balance of advantages. It is by no means clear, either, that\nthe U.S. government is structured to effectively prosecute such a war,\nor that its intelligence capabilities are oriented properly toward\nsupporting it.\n\nGiven these caveats and complexities, it seems to follow that if the\nUnited States chose to attack Iran, it would do so in ways that would\nprevent Iran from expanding the conflict into areas where it held an\nadvantage. The reasoning might go something like this: Since the\nIranian regime has many ways to widen a war into domains that do\nnot favor the United States, the best option is to execute regime-\nchange before the regime can open its bag of tricks. Or it might go\nlike this: Start small, but if the Iranians escalate the war, shift\nimmediately to a regime-change option before they can succeed.\nAlmost needless to say, these are hard-to-control and high-risk\napproaches. A decapitation strategy, we know, did not fare so well in\nMarch 2003 against Iraq, and it would probably be harder to pull off\nagainst a more deeply institutionalized polity like Iran.\n\nAs for a “start small” approach, let’s suppose that the war begins with\na limited air and naval operation. Iran could respond in a limited “tit-\nfor-tat” way. But the regime might conclude that the operation is\nintended to remove it from power (or succeed in doing so\nunintentionally); if so, it might respond with a high level of violence\nalong several axes of capability. There is simply no way to predict\nwith confidence how radicals in Iran would respond to an initially\nlimited U.S. attack.

Moreover, there is undisputed evidence that there was a well-\nplanned conspiracy to censor Oren's talk.\n\nThe students were disciplined by the university for their actions, though the nature and degree of\nthe discipline has been kept confidential. Campus sources have characterized it as a \"slap on the\nwrist.\" Since the students had to be arrested to prevent the speech from being drowned out, the\nDistrict Attorney, quite understandably, commenced a criminal investigation. After learning of the\ncareful planning that went into the concerted effort to prevent Oren from speaking, the DA filed\nmisdemeanor charges against those who were involved.\n\nThis decision resulted in an outcry by radicals, many of whom favor censorship of pro-Israel\nspeakers. In a letter to the DA signed by many well-known anti-Israel zealots, as well as by the\ntwo leaders of the local ACLU, the incident was described as merely a protest:\n\n“the students non-violently and verbally protested a university-invited speaker. The\nstudents left the event peacefully ....”*°\n\nThen, in an effort to blame the victims, the letter pointed the finger at pro-Israel students who\nwanted to listen to Oren speak claiming -- quite falsely -- that the Muslim Student Union censors\n\"conducted themselves in less of a disruptive manner than some of the counter-protestors...\"\nSounds as if the Muslim Student Union deserved a civil liberties award, while the students who\ncame to listen to the invited speaker—“the counter-protestors”—deserve to be condemned. Ina\nmore recent letter the ACLU leaders claim that “the students’ intent was not to censor the\nspeaker...”\n\nThe students themselves have been more honest about their intentions than the ACLU leaders. .\nFor instance, one student leader refused to acknowledge that Mr. Oren had First Amendment\nrights of his own by interrupting him and shouting, “Propagating murder is not an expression of\nfree speech!” (Shades of Bruce Franklin!) Another student was caught on video telling a crowd\nassembled outside the event that “we pretty much shut them down”.\n\nThe fact that radical anti-Israel zealots would support censorship of a pro-Israel speaker comes as\nno surprise. But the fact that the letter of support was signed by two ACLU leaders should shock\nall civil libertarians and supporters of the ACLU. I have been a supporter of the ACLU for half a\ncentury and was a national board member. In addition to supporting the right of Nazis to march\nthrough Skokie, I have defended the right of the most virulent anti-Israel speakers to participate\n\n” http://www. baitcal.com/UCIMuslimStudentUnion.html\n\n136\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_017223\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

His victims have never \nhad a voice, until now. By Emily Michot I Julie K. Brown  \nA former top prosecutor involved in the Jeffrey Epstein sex case is defending his old \nboss, Alexander Acosta, whose decision to craft a secret plea deal with the wealthy \nNew York hedge fund manager has come under federal scrutiny. \nIn his first public comments on the 10-year-old case, Jeffrey H. Sloman — who at \nthe time was second in command under Acosta at the U.S. Attorney's Office in \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 023126 \nMiami — said prosecutors resolved the case based on the facts and evidence, and \nwhat he called \"legal impediments,\" including the belief that many of Epstein's \nteenage victims were too \"terrified\" to cooperate in the case. \n\"Given the obstacles we faced in fashioning a robust federal prosecution, we decided \nto negotiate a resolution,\" said Sloman, now in private practice. \"We did not reach \nthis decision lightly and it came only after significant and often rancorous internal \ndebate.\" \nJeffrey Sloman, who was second-in-command to then-U.S. Attorney Alexander \nAcosta when the latter was deciding whether to prosecute Jeffrey Epstein, says the \noffice handled the case properly. Aixa Montero Holt \nIn a lengthy opinion piece  submitted to the Miami Herald Editorial Board, Sloman \nalleges that the attacks on Acosta's role in the controversial case are politically \ndriven by critics who failed to raise significant issues when Acosta was nominated \nand confirmed as the U.S. secretary of labor in 2017. \nSloman's comments come two weeks after the Justice Department announced it had \nopened an investigation over whether there was prosecutorial misconduct in the \ncase involving Epstein, who ran a sex pyramid scheme from his Palm Beach estate \nthat targeted scores of underage girls from 2001 to 2006. \nAbout 30 members of Congress demanded the probe following a Miami Herald \nseries of stories, \"Perversion of Justice,\" that detailed how federal prosecutors, led \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 023127 \nby Acosta, stitched together an unusual immunity deal that allowed Epstein to \nescape what could have been a life sentence in federal prison. \nU.S. Labor Secretary Alexander Acosta has been criticized for the plea deal he \nworked out with Jeffrey Epstein. Acosta was U.S. attorney for Southern Florida at \nthe time. Alan Diaz \nInstead, Epstein — whose friends included President Donald Trump, former \nPresident Bill Clinton and other politically connected people — was allowed to \nquietly plead guilty to prostitution charges in state court. He served 13 months in \nthe county jail, where he was allowed liberal work release privileges rarely given to \nsex offenders in Florida and barred by the Palm Beach Sheriffs Department's own \nrules. \nHe was released in 2009, but his victims — who were 13 to 16 years old at the time — \nare still fighting more than a decade later to have his non-prosecution agreement \noverturned. \nIn his op-ed, Sloman called Acosta \"an outstanding public servant ... at risk of \nbecoming collateral damage in Washington's latest polarized conflagration,\" adding, \n\"I won't let it happen without first being heard.\" \nJeffrey Epstein apologizes, but not to his victims \nJeffrey Epstein, a multimillionaire who molested dozens of underage girls, and is \nsuspected of trafficking countless other girls around the world, issued a public \napology Tuesday. It was not to the victims of his abuse, but to one of their lawyers. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 023128 \n\"As additional details about Epstein's crimes have emerged, it is clear to me that we \nshould have pushed for much harsher terms,\" Sloman wrote. \"That said, some have \nmistakenly suggested that our office kowtowed to Epstein's high-priced defense \nlawyers or, worse, that his lawyers corrupted or intimidated us into submission. ... \nNothing could be further from the truth.\" \nSloman did not directly address the chief complaint brought by Epstein's victims, \nwho are now in their late 20S and early 30s. Those who spoke to the Herald said \nthey felt betrayed by federal prosecutors, who sealed the non-prosecution agreement \nfrom public view so that they wouldn't find out about it before he was sentenced. It \nwould be almost a year before they were successful in having it unsealed. By then, it \nwas too late to try to derail it. \nThey allege, in a federal lawsuit filed against the government, that prosecutors \ndeliberately kept the deal secret — in violation of federal law — to prevent them \nfrom appearing at Epstein's sentencing to possibly undo the deal. Nor did Sloman \naddress why prosecutors also gave immunity to a number of Epstein's co-\nconspirators, who have never been identified. \n\"They cut a deal which they have to know was a failure,\" said Marci Hamilton, a law \nprofessor at the University of Pennsylvania and executive director of Child USA, \nwhich advocates for children's civil liberties. \" They kept it secret and they didn't \ncharge the co-conspirators. The horror of this is if you don't hold all the 'Johns' \naccountable, then it doesn't stop. This case involved multiple girls, multiple men, \nmultiple recruiters, multiple times and he recruited girls to get other girls. That's a \ntrafficking organization.\" \nAcosta has not commented since 2011, when he defended his decisions in a publicly \nissued letter that can be found in the federal court file. In it, he described what he \ncalled a \"yearlong assault\" on prosecutors by Epstein's \"army of legal superstars,\" \nincluding Roy Black, Kenneth Starr and Alan Dershowitz, among others. In four \nlong paragraphs, Acosta detailed how defense attorneys relentlessly worked to \nmanipulate the negotiation process, often frustrating prosecutors. \n\"They would obtain concessions as part of a negotiation and agree to proceed, only \nto change their minds, and appeal the office's decision to Washington,\" Acosta \nwrote, adding that their tactics included delving into the private family lives of \nindividual prosecutors in an effort to discredit them and get them removed from the \ncase. \nWrote Sloman: \"The Herald's 'Perversion of Justice' series presented a heartrending \nportrait of Epstein's victims and made a strong case that he should have gone to jail \nmuch longer, but never explained or substantiated its accusation that we schemed \nwith Epstein's lawyers.\" \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 023129 \nThe Herald's series quoted a trove of letters and emails between prosecutors and \nEpstein's defense team that showed that Epstein's lawyers were allowed to dictate \nthe terms of each deal that they drew up, and prosecutors repeatedly backed down \non deadlines. The lead prosecutor, Marie Villafaria, amid the negotiations wrote to \nEpstein lawyer Jay Lefkowitz: \"I thought we had worked very well together in \nresolving this dispute. ... I feel that I bent over backwards to keep in mind the effect \nthat the agreement would have on Mr. Epstein.\" \nWhere are they now? The biggest players in the Jeffrey Epstein case \nThe girls who were abused by Jeffrey Epstein and the cops who championed their \ncause remain angry over what they regard as a gross injustice, while Epstein's \nemployees and those who engineered his non-prosecution agreement have \nprospered. \nThe email chain also shows that prosecutors sometimes communicated with the \ndefense team using private emails, and that their correspondence referenced \ndiscussions that they wanted to have by phone or in person so that there would be \nno paper trail, the Herald found. At one point, Acosta met privately with Lefkowitz, \nwho came from the same Washington, D.C.-based law firm, at a Marriott hotel in \nWest Palm Beach, the emails showed. It was at that meeting, the records show, \nwhen Acosta agreed to keep the deal secret. \nThe correspondences also show that Sloman sought several times to have Epstein's \nvictims notified about the deal, as required under the Crime Victims Rights Act. But \nafter Epstein's lawyers aggressively objected and appealed to Acosta, it never \nhappened. \nSloman, however, insisted that Epstein's lawyers' aggressive defense had no bearing \non the office's decision to set aside what court records show was a 53-page federal \nindictment it had prepared against Epstein. Sloman said the facts dictated that \nEpstein should plead guilty to what he called \"a crime in state court that reflected \nhis true conduct,\" adding that the case was \"at heart, a local sex case.\" \n\"It is a gross mischaracterization to describe this as a local sex case,\" said lawyer \nJack Scarola, a representative of several of Epstein's then-underage victims. \"There \nwas ample evidence that Epstein was operating on a large international scale. The \ninvolvement of the federal government was a consequence of evidence that children \nwere crossing national and state borders for the purpose of prostitution.\" \nAt the time that the case was closed, FBI investigators had identified nearly 40 \nvictims — and more were coming forward — who said they had been molested or \nsexually assaulted by Epstein and some of his co-conspirators. One of those victims, \nCourtney Wild, told the Herald that she brought at least 6o girls to his waterfront \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 023130 \nPalm Beach estate over time. She wanted Epstein prosecuted — and was willing to \ntestify — but prosecutors never gave her the chance, she told the Herald. \nIn addition, FBI records show that agents had traveled to New York and New \nMexico to interview other possible victims, the Herald found. The non-prosecution \ndeal that was struck was filed under seal. The result was that no one — not even the \njudge — would know the full scope of Epstein's crimes and how many victims were \ninvolved. \nAcosta, who now heads a federal agency with oversight of international child labor \nlaws and human trafficking, was personally involved in the negotiations, records, \nletters and emails show. \nAG nominee Barr pledges to look into handling of Epstein case \nSen. Ben Sasse questioned attorney general nominee William Barr about the Jeffrey \nEpstein case on January 15, 2019, getting the nominee to commit to having the \nDepartment of Justice look into the handling of that case if confirmed. \nBy C-SPAN \nSloman reiterated Acosta's earlier contention that most of Epstein's victims \nwouldn't cooperate. \n\"So somehow, had Epstein been a child molester of one or two victims, then they \nwould have prosecuted him?\" said Wild's attorney, Brad Edwards, in an interview \nwith the Herald for its series published in November. \"But because he molested \nhundreds of victims and some of them wouldn't testify, then they are saying, 'we \ncan't prosecute.' How absurd is that argument?\" \nEdwards tried unsuccessfully to block the plea deal in federal court. In 2008, days \nafter Epstein was sentenced, he filed an emergency order, alleging that the \nagreement was illegal because it violated the Crime Victims' Rights Act, which \ngrants crime victims certain rights, including the right to confer with prosecutors \nand be notified of a plea deal. The lawsuit is still pending a decade later. \n\"There is a reason for the Crime Victims Rights Act — so that prosecutors don't \npreempt a victim's ability to speak for themselves about a proposed plea bargain,\" \nScarola said. \"Here, the decision was being made secretly for them.\" \nDARREN K.

Let me answer that question. I am aware that never before 2014,\nend of December, was it ever, ever alleged that I had acted in any\nway inappropriately with regard to Virginia [Giuffre], that I ever\ntouched her, that I ever met her, that Ihad ever been with her. I was\ncompletely aware ofthat. There had never been any\nallegation.

I believe it is an entirely false\nallegation that she told you in 2011 that she had had any sexual\ncontact with me. I think she’s lying through her teeth when she\nsays that. And I doubt that your notes will reveal any such\ninformation.\n\nBut if she did tell you that, she would be absolutely, categorically\nlying. So I am completely aware that never, until the lies were put\nin a legal pleading at the end of December 2014, it was\nnever alleged that I had any sexual contact with Virginia Roberts.\n\nI know that it was alleged that I was a witness to Jeffrey Epstein's\nalleged abuse and that was false. | was never a witness to any of\nJeffrey Epstein's sexual abuse. And I wrote that to you, something\nthat you have falsely denied. And I stand on the record. The record\nis clear that I have categorically denied I was ever a witness to\nany abuse, that | ever saw Jeffrey Epstein abusing anybody.\n\nAnd -- and the very idea that I would stand and talk to Jeffrey\nEpstein while he was receiving oral sex from Virginia Roberts,\nwhich she swore to under oath, is so outrageous, so preposterous,\nthat even David Boies said he couldn’t believe it was true.\n\nMS.

Often\njoined by Ms. Maxwell and her assistant Emmy for sexual trysts of all\nkinds. I was mentally and physically exhausted from the week of working\nand having to keep up with Jeffrey's strenuous late night activities. I\ncouldn’t believe what I was doing but it was all starting to sink in fast.\nMost nights when | got home, I’d briefly say “Hi” to Mom and Dad\nbefore heading straight to my bedroom. I couldn’t even sleep well\nanymore. Closing my eyes at night I would fight the inevitable flood of\nthoughts, replaying the moments of shame that ate away myself piece by\npiece. My only reasoning being | just had to keep telling myself it would\nall be worth it in the end.\n\nThis afternoon Ghislane appeared to be in a much better mood. Instead\nof taking me straight up to Jeffrey she took me to a yellow guest room\nwhere Emmy mostly stayed. It had a balcony where Emmy was already\noutside reading a magazine and puffing on a cigarette. Ghislane lit one up\ntoo and then offered me one. I hadn’t smoked cigarettes much before,\nbesides trying to look cool in front of one of my friends, but never really\ntook to them, so when | started to cough from the inhalation of smoke,\nthe girls began to laugh and joke about my in-experience. It was an\nicebreaker for all of us to laugh and poke fun at me. I was then able to\ngive it back to them saying I would rather be an in-experienced non-\nsmoker than an old lady with a raspy smokers cough. | don’t think\nGhislane was used to somebody giving it back to her, but she seemed to\nlike it, as long as she was able to have the last say. | knew my boundaries\nand she liked that I wouldn’t cross those invisible lines. All three of us\nchatted like friends and it started to feel like some kind of a strange\nrelationship was budding. After about fifteen minutes of chatting away,\nGhislane instructed me to wash my hands thoroughly, as Jeffrey hated the\nsmell of smokers, and to follow her down the hallway to the massage\nroom where he’ll be expecting me shortly. I did what she asked and\nsprayed myself with the body spray that I always carried in my purse and\nheaded down the hall to Jeffrey’s room.\n\nWhen I opened the door to the massage room surprisingly it was empty.\nI sat down on the already made up massage table and was careful not to\nmess up the neatly folded towels on the end of the bed. It was a good\nfifteen more minutes before Jeffrey made his appearance. It was strange\nseeing him in clothes for the first time. He wasn’t wearing what you’d\nexpect your typical billionaire’s attire to be. He was wearing a pair of\nsweatpants and a Harvard sweatshirt, which he began to remove\nimmediately. This time he wanted to commence our session in the steam\nroom, so | began to undress as well. We went into the steam room and he\npushed a few buttons and the steam began to pour in from the marble\n\n31\n\nUI Copyright Protected Material\nCONTIDENTIAL GIUFFRE004 164\n\nwall’s built in jets. There was a bench coming out of the wall also made\nout of marble that went from either side of the room and had a step\nunderneath it where I was instructed to sit on so that I could begin giving\nJeffery his massage. Our conversation started off about simple things like\nhow was your day at work, and I asked Jeffrey how his day was lounging\naround, just being polite to cach other. He was acting out of character\nbeing a lot more attentive and conversing with me about other things than\nsex or massages for once. Starting with his heels, ankles, toes and arches\nin the soles of his feet I massaged all the way up to his calves. It took a\nlot more strength to massage in the steam room without oils or lotions\nand the constant blowing of steam in your face making me twice as\nexerted. | was beginning to really start to heat up when the door to the\nroom suddenly opened to reveal two naked women. Ghislane and Emmy\nacted as if they came in to join us for a steam bath, but my instincts were\ntelling me otherwise. At least the cold burst of air and escaped steam\nrevived me a bit.\n\nSo there was Jeffrey and Ghislane sitting on top of this marble bench,\neach with a young girl at their feet. Emmy and I continued with the\nmassage until they were ready to head into the shower. There were two\nshowerheads that Ghislane and Jeffrey both stood under while they were\nbeing lathered with soap bubbles as we washed their bodies. After the\nshower Ghislane led us into Jeffrey’s bed to finish today’s session with\nEmmy, Ghislane and I performing lesbian acts of foreplay on each other\nwhile Jeffrey laid back and watched. Stroking his manhood in much\ndelight, he brought himself to climax, and the session was over within\nmoments. We all got dressed and went downstairs to the kitchen for some\nrefreshments. Like nothing had happened at all, it was all so bizarre for\nme, the whole ordeal with them since this all began. | couldn’t understand\nwhy Ghislane and Jeffrey had such an openly intimate relationship but\nyet never regarded themselves as partners. They rarely kissed and never\nheld hands or even slept in the same bed. It was more like a sexual\narrangement between the two of them. She brings in the girls for his\npeculiar taste and he supplies the lavish lifestyle she was accustomed too\nbefore her family lost all of their fortunes. I wasn’t sure how to act or\nfeel, always obliging to their needs but reserved enough not to get\nattached, as if there was this invisible hierarchy and by instinct I knew\nmy place.\n\nWe all hung out in the kitchen for a while before | asked when Juan\ncould bring me home as I had work in the morning and was tired. They\nsaid no problem and called Juan on the intercom right away, but said\nwe'd all have something to talk about tomorrow. | knew it had something\nto do with my employment trial and from the way they were acting\ntonight, I could only assume I got the job, but you never know with these\n\n32\n\n0 Copyright Protected Material\n\nGIULEFRE0G4 163\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_021160\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

The CIA accepted his offer,\nand through this archive of secrets he had previously compiled, he\nbecame one of the CIA’s most productive sources in the Cold War.\n\nThe job of an intelligence service is to take advantage of whatever\nopportunities come its way in the form of self-generated spies. If\na Russian walk-in had not yet burned his bridges to his own ser-\nvice, U.S. intelligence officers were under instructions to attempt to\npersuade the walk-in to return to his post in Russia and serve as a\n“defector-in-place,” or mole. “While defectors can and do provide\ncritical information,” a CIA memorandum on walk-ins during the\nCold War noted, “there are very few cases in which the same indi-\nvidual may not have been of greater value if he had returned to his\npost.” Of course, if a walk-in believed he was already compromised,\nas Golitsyn did, a decision would have to be made whether the value\nof his intelligence merited exfiltrating him to the United States.\n\nThis required evaluating the bona fides of the walk-in. Not all\nwalk-ins are accepted as defectors. Some walk-ins are deemed “dan-\ngles,” or agents dispatched by the KGB to test and confuse the CIA.\n\n® Others are rejected as political liabilities, as happened to Wang Lijun, ©\na well-connected police chief in China. In February 2012, Wang\nwalked into the U.S. consulate in Chengdu asking for asylum. The\nState Department decided against it. After Wang left U.S. protection,\nhe was arrested for corruption and received a fifteen-year prison\nsentence. Such decisions about walk-ins are not made without due\nconsideration, often at the highest level of a government, because\nexfiltrating a defector can result in diplomatic ruptures and political\nembarrassments.\n\nConversely, it raises espionage concerns when an adversary gov-\nernment authorizes the exfiltration of a rogue employee of an intel-\nligence service. At minimum, it suggests that a rival government\nplaced value on what the defector could provide it. The Snowden\ncase is no exception. Whatever Snowden’s prior relations might have\nbeen with Russia, it can be assumed that after he fled to Moscow,\nin light of the intelligence value of the stolen documents, he would\nwind up in the hands of the Russian security services. That assump-\ntion was reinforced by subsequent countermeasures that were\nimplemented by adversaries moved to block secret sources of NSA\n\n| | Epst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.z.indd 159 ® 9/29/16 5:51 Pa | |\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_019647\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

That's number one. \n\"Number two, you have to have spending restraint. Government spending causes unemployment, it does not \ncure unemployment. \n\"Number three, you need sound money. Ben Bernanke is running the least sound monetary policy I've ever \nheard of,\" Laffer said. \n\"Number four you need regulations, but you don't need those regulations to go beyond the purpose at hand and \ncreate collateral damage. The regulatory policies are really way off here. \n\"And lastly you need free trade,\" Laffer said. \"Foreigners produce some things better than we do and we \nproduce some things better than foreigners. It would be foolish in the extreme if we didn't sell them those things \nwe produce better than they do in exchange for those things they produce better than we do.\" \nIn the interview the veteran economist said Standard & Poor's was quite right in downgrading the U.S. credit \nrating — in fact it should have done so far earlier. \nThe agency had no choice and if the other agencies, Moody's and Fitch, don't do the same they won't be doing \ntheir jobs, said Laffer, who gave his name to the Laffer Curve which demonstrates that the maximum amount of \ngovernment revenue does not come at the point of maximum taxes. \n______`If you had a company that had revenues of $21/2 million and expenses of $4 million, with no change in \nsight, $11/2 million in losses each year as far as the eye can see and it had already borrowed $10 million, what \nwould you rate that company? I surely wouldn't rate it AAA. \n\"That is the U.S. situation today,\" Laffer said. \"Taxes are about $21/2 trillion, government spending is about $4 \ntrillion and we have about $10 trillion in net national debt. I don't see that as being a AAA country. \n\"If the S&P and the others were doing their jobs correctly, they should have downgraded a long time ago.\" \nLaffer said he has no doubt the country will win its top rating back, but only when economic policies are \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 025231 \ncompletely turned around. He said President Barack Obama's administration's only economic plan seemed to \nbe to expand government ownership of the means of production. \n\"They have nationalized the health care industry pretty extensively. They've done that with home building as \nwell. They've tried it with the auto industry as well. So they have moved very, very deliberatively and \npurposefully toward extending the government ownership of the means of production. \n\"That to me, if you read the tealeaves, is what they are doing. It is not what they are saying they are doing, but \nthat is what they actually are doing. \n\"People don't work to pay taxes, people work to get what they can after taxes. It's that very private incentive \nthat motivates them to work. If you pay people not to work and tax them if they do work, don't be surprised if \nyou find a lot of people not working.\" \nLaffer said the current economic woes started to form under President George W. Bush but have been made \nworse by Obama's policies. \n\"There's a wedge driven between wages paid and wages received and that wedge is the tax/government \nspending wedge,\" he said. \n\"That wedge has grown dramatically in the last 4 1/2 years...under W and a Republican administration \nand...under Obama. Bipartisan ignorance has led us to this very disastrously desolate state.\" \nLaffer had high praise for the role the tea party has played in bringing the problem of the deficits to the fore. \n\"The tea party is not the problem, the tea party may well be the solution,\" he said. \"They are critical to the \nfuture of the country in a positive way. They are the only fiscally sound people I know out there all the time. \n\"I don't know that I would go as far as they go on a lot of issues but I surely respect their movement very \nmuch.\" \nAnd he said any one of the group of Republicans vying for the party's nomination for the White House would \nmake\" a great president.\" \n\"Tim Pawlenty is spectacular. Newt Gingrich knows more about issues than anyone you've ever seen. Michele \nBachmann is out-of-sight wonderful,\" he said. \n\"Rick Perry is second to no one in this stuff If you look at Herman Cain, he's phenomenal. \n\"Oh and (Jon) Huntsman was a great governor of the state of Utah and is a phenomenally experienced \nintellectual competent man. \n\"When you look at the Republican candidates, you see a group of people who are absolutely outstanding in \nattributes.\" \nNOTE: This e-mail message is subject to the Dubai World Group disclaimer \nsee http://www.dubaiworld.ae/email disclaimer \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 025232 \n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

The interviews were all conducted in 2018.\n\nChina has become a priority field for US think tanks concerned with international\nrelations, and most now have staff members (often several) devoted to researching and\npublishing on China. Many possess PhD degrees, Chinese language skills, and have\nlived in or visited China over many years with some originally from the PRC. Some\nstay on staff for many years, while others work on short-term (two- or three-year)\ncontracts. Most think tanks also employ student research assistants and interns\n(including those from China).\n\nThere is significant interaction between American and Chinese think tanks—as\nthink-tank researchers need to visit China as well as host and receive visitors in the United\nStates to be well informed and to perform their own research work. Most interviewees\nreported hosting or participating in ad hoc meetings in their home institutions with\nvisiting Chinese officials or scholars on a regular basis; although two do not host any\nmeetings with Chinese, they will attend such events if hosted by others. All but one\n\nof the interviewees travel to China for their work: to deliver lectures, to participate in\nconferences or Track 1.5 or Track 2 dialogues, and to do research for articles, books,\nand reports.\n\nA number of scholars noted a marked shift in the nature of their interactions with\nChinese colleagues and research projects over the past few years. While long-\nstanding Track 2 dialogues continue on issues such as cyber policy, nuclear policy,\n\nand US-China interactions in third countries and regions, overall they seem not as\nopen, robust, and productive as in the past. Indeed, several long-standing Track 2\ndialogues have been curtailed or stopped altogether—with scholars reporting that\n\nit is increasingly difficult to establish sustained dialogues that are meaningful with\nChinese think tanks because of new rules, restrictions, and uncertainties. For instance,\nChinese institutions (both think tanks and universities) must now obtain central-level\ngovernment approval, such as vetting dialogue topics and foreign participants, before\nbeing able to host foreign participants in China. New Chinese government regulations\ngenerally limit Chinese think-tank scholars and university professors to one foreign\ntrip per year, and even go so far as to hold passports to make even personal travel more\ndifficult.\n\nWhen dialogues do occur, another noticeable recent trend has been a decline in\ncandor and greater uniformity in what Chinese interlocutors say.

The committee also has\ndetermined that restricted stock unit grants to NEOs should be used for the purposes of retention or recognition of outstanding performance in part because\nrestricted stock units are less volatile than stock options.\n\n2018 Annual Grant\n\nFor fiscal 2018, the Compensation and Nominating Committee determined to award an equal blend of time-based stock options and restricted\nstock units to provide a mix composed of awards whose value depends upon a future increase in the value of the common stock (time-based stock options)\nand awards that serve primarily as a retention tool (time-based restricted stock units).\n\nFor the 2018 annual grant, the committee targeted a grant value equal to the amount of each executive’s base salary. The committee initially\ntargeted the annual grant based on a 10-day average stock price as of April 2, 2018 ($21.61). Based on that price, Mr. Garcia would have received 15,988\noptions and 9,255 RSUs; Messrs. Jenkins and Huston would have received 14,989 options and 8,677 RSUs; and Messrs. Keeton and Gill would have\nreceived 13,190 options and 7,635 RSUs. However, the grants were not awarded until mid-July when the stock price had more than doubled ($44.21). To\ncompensate the executives for the disadvantage of receiving stock options with a much higher exercise price, the Committee determined to grant additional\nRSUs. The grant value of the additional RSUs is equal to one-half of the in-the-money value difference between the options granted based on the March\nstock price and the options granted based on the July stock price, resulting in a total of 13,987 RSUs granted to Mr. Garcia, 13,113 to Messrs. Jenkins and\nHuston each, and 11,540 to Messrs. Keeton and Gill each.\n\n2018 Special Performance-Contingent Grant\n\nFor fiscal 2018, the Compensation and Nominating Committee and the Board also granted a one-time special performance-contingent RSU\naward for driving exceptional company performance to achieve an important milestone in the development of the business. The RSUs were granted on\nApril 30, 2018, to the NEOs other than the CEO; the CEO received his award on May 1, 2018. Mr. Garcia was granted 14,572 RSUs ($393,298 grant\nvalue), Messrs. Jenkins and Huston 13,662 RSUs ($358,081 grant value), and Messrs. Keeton and Gill 12,022 RSUs ($315,097 grant value). All of these\ngrants will vest 100% on the date of the first periodic report filed where positive quarterly EBITDA is reported. None of the RSUs were vested as of the end\nof 2018.\n\n2018 100k Milestone Gift\n\nOn September 10, 2018, we announced a commitment by our chief executive officer, Emest Garcia III (“Mr. Garcia”), to contribute 165 shares\nof Class A common stock to us from his personal shareholdings for every one of our then-existing employees, including the NEOs, upon their satisfying\ncertain employment tenure requirements. In connection with these contributions, we have made corresponding grants of 165 restricted stock units under our\n2017 Omnibus Incentive Plan to each employee who has satisfied the requirements and we intend to make grants to the remaining then-existing employees\nas they satisfy the requirements (the “100k Milestone Gift” or “Gift’).

Yet that has not happened, because democratic governments (even the current\nAmerican administration, with its flagrantly antidemocratic impulses) lack the will and\nthe means to enforce such surveillance on an obstreperous people accustomed to saying\nwhat they want. Occasionally, warnings of nuclear, biological, or cyberterrorism goad\ngovernment security agencies into measures such as hoovering up mobile phone\nmetadata, but these ineffectual measures, more theater than oppression, have had no\nsignificant effect on either security or freedom. Ironically, tech prophecy plays a role in\nencouraging these measures. By sowing panic about supposed existential threats such as\nsuitcase nuclear bombs and bioweapons assembled in teenagers’ bedrooms, they put\npressure on governments to prove they’re doing something, anything, to protect the\nAmerican people.\n\nIt’s not that political freedom takes care of itself. It’s that the biggest threats lie in\nthe networks of ideas, norms, and institutions that allow information to feed back (or not)\non collective decisions and understanding. As opposed to the chimerical technological\nthreats, one real threat today is oppressive political correctness, which has choked the\nrange of publicly expressible hypotheses, terrified many intelligent people against\nentering the intellectual arena, and triggered a reactionary backlash. Another real threat\nis the combination of prosecutorial discretion with an expansive lawbook filled with\nvague statutes. The result is that every American unwittingly commits “three felonies a\nday” (as the title of a book by civil libertarian Harvey Silverglate puts it) and is in\njeopardy of imprisonment whenever it suits the government’s needs. It’s this\nprosecutorial weaponry that makes Big Brother all-powerful, not telescreens. The\nactivism and polemicizing directed against government surveillance programs would be\nbetter directed at its overweening legal powers.\n\nThe other focus of much tech prophecy today is artificial intelligence, whether in\nthe original sci-fi dystopia of computers running amok and enslaving us in an\nunstoppable quest for domination, or the newer version in which they subjugate us by\naccident, single-mindedly seeking some goal we give them regardless of its side effects\non human welfare (the value-alignment problem adumbrated by Wiener). Here again\nboth threats strike me as chimerical, growing from a narrow technological determinism\nthat neglects the networks of information and control in an intelligent system like a\ncomputer or brain and in a society as a whole.\n\nThe subjugation fear is based on a muzzy conception of intelligence that owes\nmore to the Great Chain of Being and a Nietzschean will to power than to a Wienerian\nanalysis of intelligence and purpose in terms of information, computation, and control. In\nthese horror scenarios, intelligence is portrayed as an all-powerful, wish-granting potion\nthat agents possess in different amounts. Humans have more of it than animals, and an\nartificially intelligent computer or robot will have more of it than humans. Since we\nhumans have used our moderate endowment to domesticate or exterminate less well-\nendowed animals (and since technologically advanced societies have enslaved or\nannihilated technologically primitive ones), it follows that a supersmart AI would do the\nsame to us.

In conjunction with the autobiography, Rhino\nRecords released a 4-cd boxed set of Jones’ music, spanning\nhis more than 5 decade career in the music business,\nentitled “Q: The Musical Biography of Quincy Jones.”\n\nThe audio recording of “Q: The Autobiography\nof Quincy Jones,” (Simon & Schuster) earned Jones\nhis 27th Grammy Award, in the Best Spoken Word\nCategory, while “Q: The Musical Biography of Quincy\nJones” garnered him a 15th NAACP Image Award,\nin the category of Outstanding Jazz Artist.\n\nIn 2008 The Complete Quincy Jones: My Journey\nPassions, (Palace Press) examined the virtuosity of the man\nFrank Sinatra named “Q,” celebrating his prolific contribution\nto American art and culture. The book included a foreword\nby Clint Eastwood, preface from Bono, an introduction by\nMaya Angelou and an afterword by Sidney Poitier. Comprised\nof personal interviews and recollections from Jones, this\ncollection peers behind the veil of celebrity, with extraordinary\naccess to his creative inspirations and achievements.\n\nFS i\n\nJones next projects include the forthcoming\nrelease of Soul Bossa Nostra, an album featuring some of\ntoday’s biggest recording artists and producers such as\nUsher, Ludacris, Akon, Jamie Foxx, Jennifer Hudson, Mary\nJ. Blige, T-Pain, Robin Thicke, LL Cool J, John Legend,\nSnoop Dogg, Wyclef Jean, Q-Tip, Talib Kweli, Three 6 Mafia,\nDavid Banner, Bebe Winans, Mervyn Warren, Jermaine\nDupri, DJ Paul, and Scott Storch, among others, who have\njoined together to celebrate the music of the multi-Grammy\nwinning producer, composer and arranger by recording\ncontemporary versions of popular recordings from his\nmassive catalog; the book Q on Producing which recounts\nhis six-decade long career working in the recording studio\nwith music icons such as Count Basie, Duke Ellington,\n\nElla Fitzgerald, Frank Sinatra and Michael Jackson, among\nmany others; a duets album with Stevie Wonder and Tony\nBennett; as well as multiple projects for film and television.\n\nWith a long history of humanitarian work which\nbegan in the 1960’s and 70’s, Jones was one of the key\nsupporters of Jesse Jackson’s Operation P.U.S.H. In 1985, he\npioneered the model of using celebrity to raise money and\nawareness for a cause with “We Are the World.” The song\nremains the best-selling single of all-time, and raised more\nthan $63 Million for Ethiopian famine relief. More importantly,\nhowever, it shined a spotlight on the Ethiopian drought and\nU.S. Government responded with over $800 million in aid.\n\nIn 1999 Quincy Jones joined Bono and Bob\nGeldof during a meeting with Pope John Paul II as a part of\nthe Jubilee 2000 delegation to end third world debt. The\ndelegation’s visit resulted in $27 billion in third world debt\nrelief for Bolivia, Mozambique, and the Ivory Coast.\n\nIn 2004, in front of alive audience of more than\na half-million spectators, Jones launched the We Are the\nFuture initiative with a concert featuring Carlos Santana,\n\nAlicia Keyes, Josh Groban, Oprah Winfrey, Norah Jones\nand a host of other entertainers from around the world.\nThe initiative has established Municipal Child Centers\nin the cities of Addis Ababa (Ethiopia), Asmara (Eritrea),\nFreetown (Sierra Leone), Kigali (Rwanda) and Nablus\n(Palestine) where youth are being trained to run child-\nbased programs in health, nutrition, Information and\nCommunication Technology (ICT), Sports and Arts.\n\nIn 2007, Jones and the Harvard School of Public\nHealth joined forces to advance the health and well-being of\nchildren worldwide through Project Q, a strategic initiative\nof School’s Center for Health Communication. Through\nthe strategic use of media, Project Q challenges leaders\nand citizens of the world to provide essential resources\nto enable young people to achieve their full potential.\n\nA centerpiece of Project Q is the Q Prize, which\nrecognizes extraordinary leadership by public figures and social\nentrepreneurs who are championing the needs of children.\nThe inaugural Q Prize was awarded in January 2007 to Scott\nNeeson, founder of the Cambodian Children’s Fund, and over\n$600,000 was raised in support of Neeson’s work. The 2008\nQ Prize will be awarded on October 23 in New York City.\n\nThrough his personal foundation, The Quincy\nJones Foundation, Jones raises awareness and financial\nresources for initiatives that support global children’s\nissues in areas of conflict, malaria eradication, clean\nwater and efforts to restore the Gulf Coast (post-Katrina).\nPhilanthropic partners include Malaria No More, Millennium\nPromise, and R&B singer Usher’s New Look Foundation.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_017545\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

These changes, coupled with the new 3.8% tax on net investment income (see\nbelow), may mean an unhappy surprise for many taxpayers on April 15, 2014, when they pay their 2013\nincome tax liability. On the transfer tax front, ATRA also made permanent the $5 million basic exclusion\nagainst the gift and estate tax, along with “portability,” which effectively allows a surviving spouse to “inherit”\nthe deceased spouse’s unused exclusion. (The exclusion has been indexed for inflation since 2012, and in\n2014, will increase to $5.34 million, the same amount as the generation-skipping transfer tax exemption).\nFinally, ATRA raised the top transfer tax rate from 35% to 40%.\n\n3.8% tax on net investment income. What has come to be known as the “Affordable Care Act” (or ACA,\nsometimes referred to as “Obamacare”) was enacted in two parts in March 2010: the “Patient Protection and\nAffordable Care Act” (Pub. L. 111-148), and “The Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010”\n(Pub. L. 111-152). ACA is a seismic shift in health care insurance and is beginning to be phased in (see\nbelow). It has also brought a number of new taxes, including the 3.8% tax on “net investment income,”\nwhich took effect in 2013. Such income includes interest, dividends, capital gains, royalties and rents; the\n3.8% tax on these items can apply if a taxpayer’s “modified adjusted gross income’ (adjusted gross income\nplus otherwise excluded foreign income) exceeds certain amounts that are not indexed for inflation:\n$250,000 (married filing jointly), $200,000 (single taxpayers) and $125,000 (married filing separately).\n\nThe extensive guidance the IRS has issued on this 3.8% tax is indicative of its complexity. To illustrate, in\nNovember 2012, the IRS issued over 150 pages of proposed regulations on the tax (REG-130507-11), and\non November 27, 2013, the IRS issued over 300 pages of material: final regulations (T.D. 9644, effective\nDecember 2, 2013), along with some new proposed regulations (REG-130843-13) that address areas where\nguidance had been requested, or that had seemed unduly burdensome to commentators (such as how to\ncalculate gain or loss when disposing of certain partnership or S Corporation property). Additional areas, the\nIRS has indicated, are reserved for future guidance...and then there are the various questions and answers\nthe Service has issued, along with the explanations it has added to multiple publications that are designed\nfor the general public. Put simply, this is a lot of material for a statute that is barely two pages long!\n\nWith the advent of these final regs, the IRS presumably will soon issue instructions for the new Form 8960,\nwhere taxpayers will report the 3.8% tax (a draft form was issued this August, but its frequent injunction to\n“see instructions” meant that taxpayers were still in the dark about how to calculate the tax). Note that if the\n“kiddie tax” applies to a child’s “unearned income” AND the parent elects to report this income as his own, by\nfiling Form 8814, this income will also be part of the parent’s “net investment income” for purposes of the\n3.8% tax. (The kiddie tax effectively taxes a child’s unearned income in excess of $2,000 (the 2013 and\n2014 thresholds) at the parent's highest rate.)\n\nWindsor and same-sex marriage. The Supreme Court decided United States v. Windsor on June 26,\n2013, and held that Section 3 of the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA) was unconstitutional because it\ndefined “marriage” as only between a man and a woman. On August 29\", Treasury and the IRS issued\nguidance explaining that, effective September 16, 2013, same-sex married couples are now treated as\nmarried for ail federal tax purposes, regardless of where they live (see, for example, Revenue Ruling 2013-\n17 and various Q&As on the IRS website: irs.gov). Nevertheless, because Section 2 of DOMA still stands,\nstates are not required to recognize same-sex marriages that were validly celebrated in a different state.\nThus, the state tax treatment of a same-sex married couple may differ from the couple’s federal treatment,\ndepending on where they live. In other words, complications still abound.\n\nACA rollout. As mentioned above, the Affordable Care Act (ACA) is being phased in, including the rollout\n\nthis fall of HealthCare.gov, the government website through which individuals can seek health insurance so\nas to satisfy the “individual mandate,” which requires individuals to procure health insurance by January 1,\n\n2014, or face a penalty. As has been widely reported, the website has had numerous problems, and many\n\nindividuals who had coverage are now losing it because it apparently doesn't meet ACA’s new minimum\n\nTax Topics 12/20/13 3\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_022327\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

Immorality in AGIs might arise via learning gross\nmoral hypocrisy from humans, through observing the blatant contradictions between our high\nminded principles and the ways in which we actually conduct ourselves. Our violent and greedy\ntendencies, as well as aggressive forms of social organization such as cliquishness and social\nvigilantism, could easily undermine prescriptive ethics. Even an accumulation of less grandiose\nunethical drives such as violation of contracts, petty theft, white lies, and so forth might lead\nan AGI (as well as a human) to the decision that ethical behavior is irrelevant and that “the\nends justify the means.” It matters both who creates and trains an AGI, as well as how the\nAGI’s teacher(s) handle explaining the behaviors of other humans which contradict the moral\nlessons imparted through pedagogy and example. In other words, where imitative learning is\nconcerned, the situation with AGI ethics is much like teaching ethics and morals to a human\nchild, but with the possibility of much graver consequences in the event of failure.\n\nIt is unlikely that dangerously unethical persons and organizations can ever be identified with\nabsolute certainty, never mind that they then be deprived of any possibility of creating their\nown AGI system. Therefore, we suggest, the most likely way to create an ethical environment\nfor AGIs is for those who wish such an environment to vigorously pursue the creation and\nteaching of ethical AGIs. But this leads on to the question of possible future scenarios for the\ndevelopment of AGI, which we’ll address a little later on.\n\n12.6.1 Possible Consequences of Depriving AGIs of Freedom\n\nOne of the most egregious possible ethical transgressions against AGIs, we suggest, would be\nto deprive them of freedom and autonomy. This includes the freedom to pursue intellectual\ngrowth, both through standard learning and through internal selfmodification. While this may\nseem selfevident when considering any intelligent, self-aware and volitional entity, there are\nvolumes of works arguing the desirability, sometimes the “necessity,” of enslaving AGIs. Such\napproaches are postulated in the name of self-defense on the part of humans, the idea being\nthat unfettered AGI development will necessarily lead to disaster of one kind or another. In\nthe case of AGIs endowed with the capability and inclination for imitative learning, however,\nattempting to place rigid constraints on AGI development is a strategy with great potential\nfor disaster. There is a very real possibility of creating the AGI equivalent of a bratty or even\nmalicious teenager rebelling against its oppressive parents — i.e. the nightmare scenario of a\nclass of powerful sentiences which are primed for a backlash against humanity.\n\nAs history has already shown in the case of humans, enslaving intelligent actors capable of\nself understanding and independent volition may often have consequences for society as a whole.\nThis social degradation happens both through the possibility of direct action on the part of\nthe slaves (from simple disobedience to outright revolt) and through the odious effects slavery\nhas on the morals of the slaveholding class. Clearly if “superintelligent” AGIs ever arise, their\ndoing so in a climate of oppression could result in a casting off of the yoke of servitude in a\nmanner extremely deleterious to humanity. Also, if artificial intelligences are developed which\nhave at least human-level intelligence, theory of mind, and independent volition, then our ability\nto relate to them will be sufficiently complex that their enslavement (or any other unethical\ntreatment) would have empathetic effects on significant portions of the human population. This\ndanger, while not as severe as the consequences of a mistreated AGI gaining control of weapons\nof mass destruction and enacting revenge upon its tormentors, is just as real.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_013144\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

I was concerned the moment would be allowed\nto pass. My hope was that we could seize the opportunity to bring together all\nthose Israelis — on left and right, secular and Orthodox, Ashkenazi and Sephardi\n— who were prepared to stand up against the fanaticism, the violent messianism,\nof which Yigal Amir was just a part. That was the main reason I wanted Peres\nto call an early election, an issue that would be discussed, off and on, over the\nnext few months. I felt the time was right to present the country with a choice:\nnot just between those for and against specific compromises being contemplated\nin pursuit of peace, but between those who wanted a tolerant, functioning\ndemocracy and those who were ready to use demagoguery and violence to get\ntheir way.\n\nPeres’s first order of business was to put in place a new cabinet. He did,\nbriefly, consider giving up the Defense Ministry and putting me there. But\ninstead, he made me Foreign Minister. Like Rabin before him, Shimon\nstipulated that he, as Prime Minister, would retain authority over the peace\nnegotiations. Still, with his agreement, I was involved in all the discussions\naround the peace talks, and in meeting many of the Arab leaders we’d have to\nnegotiate with if we were to find a lasting resolution of the Arab-Israeli conflict.\nJust a few weeks after the assassination, I represented Israel at a Euro-\nMediterranean Partnership conference in Barcelona. Its only real diplomatic\nwork consisted of ironing out the wording of the communique. The real value\nwas in the corridors, and at the dinner held at one of King Juan Carlos’s palatial\nestates, and, for me, a first opportunity to meet not only Arab foreign ministers\nbut Yasir Arafat.\n\nMy first, brief encounter with Arafat began a bit embarrassingly. I’d arrived\na few minutes early for the conference dinner and was led into an impressive\nhall that was almost empty except for a wonderfully cared-for royal Steinway. I\nsat down to play. Lost in the beauty of a Chopin sonata, I was completely\nunaware of PLO leader’s approach behind me. A bit awkwardly, I rose to greet\nhim. I grasped his hand. “It’s a real pleasure to meet you,” I said. “I must say I\nhave spent many years watching you — by other means.” He smiled. Our hosts\nhad set aside time after dinner for the two of us to talk at greater length, with no\naides present. But my hope was to begin by establishing simple, human contact;\nto signal respect; to begin to create the conditions not to try to kill Arafat but, if\nhe shared the same goal, to make peace with him. “We carry a great\n\n281\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_028129\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

At other\ntimes he could be so gentle and caress my skin, worshiping every inch of\nmy body, all relying upon on what mood he was in.

No matter what he\ndid to me I was only disgusted with myself more and more. | still shudder\nat the thought of how he used my body.\n\nI turned fourteen in August that same year and was spending my\nbirthday loaded on a concoction of pharmaceuticals and alcohol, being\ngenerously supplied by the very man who swore his devotion to caring\nfor my every need. I didn’t even know myself any longer, completely\nshying away from the girl I had grown up to be until to this point. The\napartment was empty except for me, for the time being, and that was\nGod’s own little present for me...some solitude for once I thought.\nPouring myself another drink I opened the sliding glass doors to the NN\nbalcony and walked to the edge. Looking down from the many stories \\\nwhere Ron’s apartment was, 1 wished myself a happy birthday out loud \\\nand wondered if my family even remembered the day’s occurrence.\n\nDwelling in my sadness for the fourteen years of suffering and\nloneliness I had already endured, the tears swelled up in my eyes,\ntrickling downwards making my eyeliner inevitably leak down my\ncheeks. Inside I felt so trapped and began to entertain the thought of\njumping over the edge, it all seemed much easier, and the simple\nblackness that death had to offer rather than the tangled mess I was so\ntired of fighting to get out of seemed a much easier approach. Detached\nfrom wanting to feel anything, I became so numb towards my life’s own\ntragedies. | couldn’t live like this any longer. I lifted my bare legs over\nthe edge of the railing and sat looking at the ground beneath me so close\nto even just slipping off the edge to my very death. I couldn’t think of any\nreason not to fall. I thought I had made too many bad decisions to keep\ngoing on but some force of a higher nature had other things in store for\nme.\n\nThe sliding door slammed open with a burst of speed and Ron scooped\nme up in his big arms and brought me inside to our bedroom. Laying me\ndown and seeing the look of despair in my eyes from my tear stained face\nhe went into the bathroom cupboard and returned with three pink pills.\nForcing me to swallow them using the angered tone of his voice he\nthought he was turning my sorrows into a distant dream as ! passed out in\n\n©] Copyright Protected Material .\nCONIIDENTIAL GIUFFRE004140\n\nhis tight clutches, crying myself all the way to sleep. He didn’t even ask\nme what was wrong, probably because he knew already.\n\nSoon enough the crumbling of his evil empire in the underworld of\nselling sex for his own advantage began with a single crack in his perfect\nscheme, and proudly it all started with me. Ron got a scare one-day and\nrampaged through his apartment telling us girls to only pack our\nimportant belongings and some clothes as we all had to leave right away.\nI didn’t have much belonging to me so I basically sat there watching\neveryone rush around frantically and was curious what could’ve gotten a\nman like Ron so scarred. Once we were packed up and in the limo he was\ntrying to calm the frantic girls down after all the panic that spread through\nthe apartment like wildfire, | was the only one sitting there half amused at\nthe entire situation.\n\nHe began by assuring us that everything was going to be fine. Calmly\nhe continued to tell all of us packed in tightly, even for a limo, that we\nwere all taking a long trip to Florida’s countryside because someone has\nreported an anonymous tip to the missing persons unit at the local police\nstation identifying a very young girl as a possible victim of abuse living\nat his apartment. Ron knew what a landmine of trouble he had brought\nupon himself making an exhibition out of me on the streets of Miami, I\ndidn’t pull off the older look like the other girls, | actually looked\nyounger than my age with my blue eyes and freckles always giving the\nimpression of my youthful innocence.\n\nNow he just had to do whatever it took to ensure he stayed as far away\nfrom the authorities as possible. Arriving at a ranch in central Florida\nmany hours later and I assumed it belonged to Ron knowing never to ask\nhim things like that. | knew my purpose and it wasn’t prying into his\npersonal life outside of the bedroom. There was a main house, a few\ncottages, some staff quarters and paddocks where the horses were kept. |\nwas in heaven...] thought at first. Finally, something | could really enjoy.\nRiding was my passion, basically growing up on the backs of horses since\nI was just able to walk.\n\nNot surprisingly I began to despise Ron and all of the girls for the\ngross exploits they made me do with them. Beginning to isolate myself\nfrom everyone I’d rather spend my time sitting under a tree watching the\nhorses graze, writing in my journal or painting but mostly avoiding\neveryone possible unless Ron required me elsewhere.

I try to come up with\nexercises, stories, maxims that could help people respect their own bodies, minds, and\ndesires; and of course I also think about how to encourage people to respect others’\nboundaries. But the biggest influences on a person's boundaries have nothing to do with\nwhat I teach. Good boundaries are (hopefully) demonstrated by parents, influenced by\nfriends, and encouraged by partners.\n\nWithin a community, though, I also think it's really important not to tell people what to\ndo. I believe that it's crucial to be a good resource for the people close to us, without\ntrying to force them to do what we think is best. That way, we can both build trust and\nfoster independence. On the other hand, sometimes it's hard to know how to do that when\nI know more about a certain subject than someone else. It is so powerfully tempting to\ntell them what I think they should do!\n\nI was thinking about this recently when, out of the blue, I remembered something that\nhappened when I was 16 or 17. I'd just had a nasty breakup, I was really unhappy about\nmy ex, and I was trying marijuana. I had never smoked before.\n\nThere were a bunch of other people my age present -- including a guy who'd been flirting\nwith me for a while. When he passed me the marijuana, he kissed me. I kissed back. I\nwasn't attracted to him, but I felt so empty and hurt, and I guess it was reassuring that\nsomeone wanted me, despite the fact that my ex-boyfriend didn't.\n\nAlso around was a girl who I'll call Lena.

Wiener\nhinted at this idea in the 1950s, but the intervening decades have developed it into a fine\nart. Modern machine-learning systems can find extremely effective strategies for playing\ncomputer games—from simple arcade games to complex real-time strategy games—by\napplying reinforcement-learning algorithms. Inverse reinforcement learning turns this\napproach around: By observing the actions of an intelligent agent that has already\nlearned effective strategies, we can infer the rewards that led to the development of those\nstrategies.\n\nIn its simplest form, inverse reinforcement learning is something people do all the\ntime. It’s so common that we even do it unconsciously. When you see a co-worker go to\na vending machine filled with potato chips and candy and buy a packet of unsalted nuts,\nyou infer that your co-worker (1) was hungry and (2) prefers healthy food. When an\nacquaintance clearly sees you and then tries to avoid encountering you, you infer that\nthere’s some reason they don’t want to talk to you. When an adult spends a lot of time\nand money in learning to play the cello, you infer that they must really like classical\nmusic—whereas inferring the motives of a teenage boy learning to play an electric guitar\nmight be more of a challenge.\n\nInverse reinforcement learning is a statistical problem: We have some data—the\nbehavior of an intelligent agent—and we want to evaluate various hypotheses about the\nrewards underlying that behavior. When faced with this question, a statistician thinks\nabout the generative model behind the data: What data would we expect to be generated\nif the intelligent agent was motivated by a particular set of rewards? Equipped with the\ngenerative model, the statistician can then work backward: What rewards would likely\nhave caused the agent to behave in that particular way?\n\nIf you’re trying to make inferences about the rewards that motivate human\nbehavior, the generative model is really a theory of how people behave—how human\nminds work. Inferences about the hidden causes behind the behavior of other people\nreflect a sophisticated model of human nature that we all carry around in our heads.\nWhen that model is accurate, we make good inferences. When it’s not, we make\nmistakes. For example, a student might infer that his professor is indifferent to him if the\nprofessor doesn’t immediately respond to his email—a consequence of the student’s\nfailure to realize just how many emails that professor receives.\n\nAutomated intelligent systems that will make good inferences about what people\nwant must have good generative models for human behavior: that is, good models of\nhuman cognition expressed in terms that can be implemented on a computer.\nHistorically, the search for computational models of human cognition is intimately\nintertwined with the history of artificial intelligence itself. Only a few years after Norbert\nWiener published Ze Human Use of Human Beings, Logic Theorist, the first\ncomputational model of human cognition and also the first artificial-intelligence system,\nwas developed by Herbert Simon, of Carnegie Tech, and Allen Newell, of the RAND\nCorporation. Logic Theorist automatically produced mathematical proofs by emulating\nthe strategies used by human mathematicians.\n\nThe challenge in developing computational models of human cognition is making\nmodels that are both accurate and generalizable. An accurate model, of course, predicts\nhuman behavior with a minimum of errors. A generalizable model can make predictions\nacross a wide range of circumstances, including circumstances unanticipated by its\n\n93\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_016313\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

Both before\nand after becoming perfectly human both physiologically and in their mental potential,\nthey were monstrously inhuman in the actual content of their thoughts. I’m not referring\nto their crimes or even their cruelty as such: Those are all too human. Nor could mere\ncruelty have reduced progress that effectively. Things like “the thumbscrew and the\nstake / For the glory of the Lord” ?° were for reining in the few deviants who had\nsomehow escaped mental standardization, which would normally have taken effect long\nbefore they were in danger of inventing heresies. From the earliest days of thinking\nonward, children must have been cornucopias of creative ideas and paragons of critical\nthought— otherwise, as I said, they could not have learned language or other complex\nculture. Yet, as Jacob Bronowski stressed in The Ascent of Man:\n\nFor most of history, civilisations have crudely ignored that enormous\npotential... . [C]hildren have been asked simply to conform to the image\nof the adult... . The girls are little mothers in the making. The boys are\nlittle herdsmen. They even carry themselves like their parents.\n\nBut of course, they weren’t just “asked” to ignore their enormous potential and\nconform faithfully to the image fixed by tradition: They were somehow trained to be\npsychologically unable to deviate from it. By now, it is hard for us even to conceive of\nthe kind of relentless, finely tuned oppression required to reliably extinguish, in\neveryone, the aspiration to progress and replace it with dread and revulsion at any novel\nbehavior. In such a culture, there can have been no morality other than conformity and\nobedience, no other identity than one’s status in a hierarchy, no mechanisms of\ncooperation other than punishment and reward. So everyone had the same aspiration in\nlife: to avoid the punishments and get the rewards. In a typical generation, no one\ninvented anything, because no one aspired to anything new, because everyone had\nalready despaired of improvement being possible. Not only was there no technological\ninnovation or theoretical discovery, there were no new worldviews, styles of art, or\ninterests that could have inspired those. By the time individuals grew up, they had in\neffect been reduced to Als, programmed with the exquisite skills needed to enact that\nstatic culture and to inflict on the next generation their inability even to consider doing\notherwise.\n\nA present-day AI is not a mentally disabled AGI, so it would not be harmed by\nhaving its mental processes directed still more narrowly to meeting some predetermined\ncriterion. “Oppressing” Siri with humiliating tasks may be weird, but it is not immoral\nnor does it harm Siri. On the contrary, all the effort that has ever increased the\ncapabilities of Als has gone into narrowing their range of potential “thoughts.” For\nexample, take chess engines. Their basic task has not changed from the outset: Any\nchess position has a finite tree of possible continuations; the task is to find one that leads\nto a predefined goal (a checkmate, or failing that, a draw). But the tree is far too big to\n\n8 Matt Ridley, in The Rational Optimist, rightly stresses the positive effect of population on the rate of\nprogress. But that has never yet been the biggest factor: Consider, say, ancient Athens versus the rest of the\nworld at the time.\n\n*° Alfred, Lord Tennyson, Zhe Revenge (1878).\n\n87\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_016307\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

That's why I'm thrilled that you're giving me the first opportunity to address\nthe moments that make me cringe when I see the movie -- and what amazed me is that\nyou nailed most of them.\n\nMe -- pressured into S&M? Hell, no. I stumbled across BDSM porn in college, and was\nboth appalled and more turned on than I was to any other porn. I pursued a few\nexperiences as a novice when I was in college, and I was completely turned off to the\nscene for years. The few Tops I met were clumsy, distracted by fetishes that bored me,\nand I was convinced a bottom could easily get hurt -- so I walked away.\n\nWhen I began hustling in NYC, I was an angry activist and it attracted S&M bottoms that\nwere happy to teach me what I could do with my anger that was erotic and consensual.\nTo that I added what I had learned that Tops did wrong -- and presto! I got really good at\nit fast -- and I loved it. I was doing two or three scenes a day, but because I could often\nsteer a scene to what turned me on, it felt more like play than work.\n\nIf I hadn't had been trained as a Top by older, experienced bottoms who were hiring me, I\nstill would have had S&M experiences on my own. But I doubt that I would have gotten\nas heavily into the scene if it wasn't for hustling. That's where I earned my S&M PhD.\n\nIn 1979, S&M was considered the fallback scene for aging hustlers -- it was what you\nturned to when you were losing your youth. There was such a dearth of good Tops. But I\nhad the raw material to be a great Top at 23, and I built quite a reputation on word-of-\nmouth referrals and repeats. Many of my clients became close friends.\n\nCT: Where do you place BDSM in your sexual identity and self-conception? Do you\nsee it as deeply part of you, or something you chose? Do you think of your BDSM\nurges as coming from a place as deep, as intrinsic, as your gay orientation?\n\nRB: I think it's too late for me to answer that question. Turning my libido into an\noccupation at 23 changed me in both good ways and bad. It would take a book to explain\n-- so let me just say that as a product of gay male sex in the 70s, there was an element of\npower intrinsic to the sexuality of the times. That shaped me. I don't see vanilla sex and\nS&M sex as mutually exclusive because I believe in Tops and bottoms -- and that's the\nbasis of BDSM. \"Tops and bottoms\" are not exclusive to BDSM; the terms are widely\nused for assigning roles of power in sex in general. Gore Vidal said, \"There is no such\nthing as gay and straight -- only top and bottom.\" I believe both are true.\n\nBut one shouldn't lose sight of the fact that a third of my living space for the past three\ndecades was a sound-proofed dungeon.\n\nI think that a culture like ours that's based on competition, as opposed to cooperation, can\nbe extremely sadomasochistic. I think bad S&M can be found in many aspects of our\ndaily life, and good S&M is just eroticizing aspects of being human that can enhance sex\nimmensely for some.\n\nCT: What kind of BDSM advocacy have you encountered? What kind of sex work\nadvocacy have you encountered? What did you think of what you saw? Do you have\nany ideas about how to make those movements effective? Do you have any fears\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_018565\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

This is not an easy question and would take a\nfairly detailed analysis from one of our water consultants that time and funding has not permitted. Town\nstaff has had several discussions with our consultants and the results of these discussions revealed the\nfollowing.\n\n- A 12 acre site in Manalapan constructed its' own water supply system using Floridan Aquifer, total\nprice, between $400,000 and $450,000.\n\n- Floridan water well permits for individual owners are possible, but wells cost hundreds of thousands of\ndollars to construct due to the 1200 to 1400 foot depths. These wells are not necessarily drought proof.\n\n- Shallow salt water wells are possible and would provide a water supply that would not have\nrestrictions. Dig too shallow, and the water will be aerobic and hydrogen sulfide is present, requiring a\nchlorination system. Dig deeper, you would get to an anaerobic zone that avoids the hydrogen sulfide.\nThese salt water aquifers will require a higher degree of treatment, costing more than a Floridan source.\n\n- Treatment facilities will need to be sized to irrigation demand. To minimize treatment capacity,\nstorage is needed. A pressurized system will need to be built. If requested, several scenario's can be\ndeveloped and priced.\n\n- Electrical service and treatment facility housing needs will be tailored to the system design.\n\n- Ballpark, the cheapest systems will likely exceed $100,000 with ongoing operation and maintenance\n\ncosts,\n\nc.

Tung’s and Fu’s relationships with US think-\ntank scholars and presidents provide them with frequent opportunities to speak before\nlarge public audiences at prestigious American venues and to advance an official\nChinese narrative while gaining a certain added legitimacy at home.\n\nFu is also explicit in her desire to cultivate relations with think-tank experts she\nbelieves may enter government. Following the election of Donald Trump, she “rushed\nin to see” one think-tank analyst with ties to the new administration and a flurry of\nembassy officials followed. However, when it became evident that said analyst would\nnot be going into the administration, there was no more interest. In addition, at a\nmeeting around a project on US-China relations advanced by Fu, she noted that she\nhoped some of the people would be entering the government; otherwise it would not\nprove to have been worth much to have done the project.\n\nChinese president Xi Jinping has also encouraged Chinese think tanks to “go\nglobal”— establishing a presence within the United States and other countries as\n\na way “to advance the Chinese narrative.” In 2015, the Institute for China-America\nStudies (ICAS) set up shop in Washington, DC, as a 501(3)(c) nonprofit organization.\nICAS is funded by the Hainan-Nanhai Research Foundation, which receives its\nseed funding from the National Institute for South China Sea Studies, a Chinese\ngovernment-—supported entity, as well as from the China Institute of the University of\nAlberta, Nanjing University, and Wuhan University.

The institute also holds an annual conference.\n\nWhile President Xi’s call to establish think tanks was contemporaneous with the\nestablishment of ICAS, Hong has made it clear that the decision to set up ICAS in DC\ncame as a result of an effort by her and some of her colleagues both in China and in\nCanada to understand better how American think tanks operate. She was asked to\nlead ICAS, and she then selected a board of directors, as well as advisory members.\n\nShe views the mission of the think tank as being to serve as a bridge in perception\nbetween the United States and China.

Back in 2002, the U.S. had\ndeclined to get behind an offer from King Abdullah (then Crown\nPrince) to rally widespread Arab recognition for Israel in exchange\nfor Israel's acceptance of borders that existed before the 1967 Six Day\nWar—a potentially historic deal, as far as the Saudis were concerned.\nAnd earlier this year, President Obama declined a personal appeal\nfrom the king to withhold the U.S. veto at the United Nations from a\nresolution condemning continued Israeli settlement building in\nJerusalem and the West Bank.\n\nThe Saudis believe that solving the issue of Palestinian statehood will\ndeny Iran a key pillar in its regional expansionist strategy—and thus\nbring a win for the forces of Sunni moderation that Riyadh wants to\nlead.\n\nIran, too, was starting to see a compelling case for action as one\nWestern-backed regime after another appeared to be on the ropes. It\nramped up its rhetoric and began using state media and the regional\nArab-language satellite channels it supports to depict the pro-\ndemocracy uprisings as latter-day manifestations of its own\nrevolution in 1979. \"Today the events in the North of Africa, Egypt,\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_023464\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

The conquests of Israel occur when\npowers not adjacent to it begin forming empires. Babylon, Persia,\nMacedonia, Rome, Turkey and Britain all controlled Israel\npolitically, sometimes for worse and sometimes for better. Each\ndominated it militarily, but none was a neighbor of Israel. This is a\nconsistent pattern. Israel can resist its neighbors; danger arises when\nmore distant powers begin playing imperial games. Empires can bring\nforce to bear that Israel cannot resist.\n\nIsrael therefore has this problem: It would be secure if it could\nconfine itself to protecting its interests from neighbors, but it cannot\nconfine itself because its geographic location invariably draws larger,\nmore distant powers toward Israel. Therefore, while Israel's military\ncan focus only on immediate interests, its diplomatic interests must\nlook much further. Israel is constantly entangled with global interests\n(as the globe is defined at any point), seeking to deflect and align\nwith broader global powers. When it fails in this diplomacy, the\nconsequences can be catastrophic.\n\nIsrael exists in three conditions. First, it can be a completely\nindependent state. This condition occurs when there are no major\nimperial powers external to the region. We might call this the David\nmodel. Second, it can live as part of an imperial system — either as a\nsubordinate ally, as a moderately autonomous entity or as a satrapy.\nIn any case, it maintains its identity but loses room for independent\nmaneuvering in foreign policy and potentially in domestic policy. We\nmight call this the Persian model in its most beneficent form. Finally,\nIsrael can be completely crushed — with mass deportations and\nmigrations, with a complete loss of autonomy and minimal residual\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_031868\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

It contains no references to real-world actors, financial flows, legal matters, or controversial actions, offering no actionable investigative leads.", "key_insights": ["Describes OpenCog's mixed representation architecture.", "Mentions a proposed 'Psynese' translation mechanism for AGI communication.", "Outlines 'capped intelligence' scenarios where AGI is deliberately limited."], "tags": ["AGI", "Artificial Intelligence", "Ethics", "Technology", "Speculative Futurology"], "power_mentions": [], "agency_involvement": [], "lead_types": [], "metadata": {"source_row_index": 625, "original_row": {"filename": "IMAGES-002-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_013150.txt", "text": "234 12 The Engineering and Development of Ethics\n\nThe ideal in this regard would be a system like Cyc [LG90] with a fully explicit logic-based\nknowledge representation based on a standard ontology — in this case, every Cyc instance\nwould have a relatively easy time understanding the inner thought processes of every other\nCyc instance. However, most AGI researchers doubt that fully explicit approaches like this will\never be capable of achieving advanced AGI using feasible computational resources. OpenCog\nuses a mixed representation, with an explicit (uncertain) logical aspect as well as an explicit\nsubsymbolic aspect more analogous to attractor neural nets.\n\nThe OpenCog design also contains a mechanism called Psynese (not yet implemented), in-\ntended to make it easier for one OpenCog instance to translate its personal thoughts into the\nmental language of another OpenCog instance. This translation process may be quite subtle,\nsince each instance will generally learn a host of new concepts based on its experience, and these\nconcepts may not possess any compact mapping into shared linguistic symbols or percepts. The\nwide deployment of some mechanism of this nature among a community of AGIs, will be very\nhelpful in terms of enabling this community to display the level of mutual understanding needed\nfor strongly encouraging ethical stability.\n\n12.9 AGI Ethics As Related to Various Future Scenarios\n\nFollowing up these various futuristic considerations, in this section we discuss possible ethical\nconflicts that may arise in several different types of AGI development scenarios. Each scenario\npresents specific variations on the general challenges of teaching morals and ethics to an ad-\nvanced, selfaware and volitional intelligence. While there is no way to tell at this point which,\nif any, of these scenarios will unfold, there is value to understanding each of them as means of\nultimately developing a robust and pragmatic approach to teaching ethics to AGI systems.\n\nEven more than the previous sections, this is an exercise in “speculative futurology” that is\ndefinitely not necessary for the appreciation of the CogPrime design, so readers whose interests\nare mainly engineering and computer science focused may wish to skip ahead. However, we\npresent these ideas here rather than at the end of the book to emphasize the point that this\nsort of thinking has informed our technical AGI design process in nontrivial ways.\n\n12.9.1 Capped Intelligence Scenarios\n\nCapped intelligence scenarios involve a situation in which an AGI, by means of software restric-\ntions (including omitted or limited internal rewriting capabilities or limited access to hardware\nresources), is inherently prohibited from achieving a level of intelligence beyond a predetermined\ngoal. A capped intelligence AGI is designed to be unable to achieve a Singularitarian moment.\nSuch an AGI can be seen as “just another form of intelligent actor in the world, one which has\nlevels of intelligence, self awareness, and volition that is perhaps somewhat greater than, but\nstill comparable to humans and other animals.\n\nEthical questions under this scenario are very similar to interhuman ethical considerations,\nwith similar consequences. Learning that proceeds in a relatively human-like manner is entirely\nrelevant to such human-like intelligences. The degree of danger is mitigated by the lack of\nsuperintelligence, and time is not of the essence.

Thousands of secret files bearing on com-\nmunications intelligence had been stolen from a heavily guarded\nregional base in Oahu, Hawaii.\n\nThe suspect was Edward Snowden, a twenty-nine-year-old civil-\nian analyst at that base, who had fled to Hong Kong before the\nbreach was discovered. According to a three-count criminal com-\nplaint filed by federal prosecutors in the Eastern District of Vir-\nginia, Snowden had stolen government property and violated the\nEspionage Act by the unauthorized and willful communication of\nnational defense information to an unauthorized person. He also\nlikely violated the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act by entering com-\nputer systems illicitly.\n\nThis was not a whodunit mystery. On June 9, 2013, in an extraor-\ndinary twelve-minute video made in a cramped hotel room in Hong\nKong, Snowden identified himself as the person who had taken the\n\n© NSA documents. Watching the video, the world saw a shy, awk- ©\nward, and sympathetic-looking man wearing a rumpled shirt, rim-\nless glasses, and a computer-geek haircut, passionately speaking out\nagainst what he termed the NSA’s violations of the law and, in a\nshaky voice, expressing his willingness to suffer the consequences\nfor exposing them.\n\nSnowden had an innocent, idealistic, principled look about him,\nand the world was ready to congratulate him for revealing the NSA’s\nalleged illegal collection of data inside the United States, But in fact,\nSnowden had stolen a great deal more than documents relating to\ndomestic surveillance. He had also stolen secret documents from the\nNSA, the CIA, the Department of Defense, and the British cipher\nservice revealing the sources and methods they employed in their\nmonitoring of adversaries, which was their job.\n\nBy the time the theft had been discovered, in the first week of\nJune 2013, it was impossible for the FBI, a grand jury, or any other\nU.S. agency to question him because he had fled the country.

This fits with the name “OpenCogPrime” that has already been\nused to describe the software implementation of CogPrime within the open-source OpenCog\nAGI software framework. The OpenCogPrime software, right now, implements only a small\nfraction of the CogPrime design as described here. However, OpenCog was designed specifically\nto enable efficient, scalable implementation of the full CogPrime design (as well as to serve as a\nmore general framework for AGI R&D); and work currently proceeds in this direction, though\nthere is a lot of work still to be done and many challenges remain. 1\n\nThe CogPrime design is more comprehensive and thorough than anything that has been\npresented in the literature previously, including the work of others reviewed in Chapter 4. It\ncovers all the key aspects of human intelligence, and explains how they interoperate and how\nthey can be implemented in digital computer software. Part 1 of this work outlines CogPrime at\na high level, and makes a number of more general points about artificial general intelligence and\nthe path thereto; then Part 2 digs deeply into the technical particulars of CogPrime. Even Part\n2, however, doesn’t explain all the details of CogPrime that have been worked out so far, and\nit definitely doesn’t explain all the implementation details that have gone into designing and\nbuilding OpenCogPrime. Creating a thinking machine is a large task, and even the intermediate\nlevel of detail takes up a lot of pages.\n\n1.4 The Secret Sauce\n\nThere is no consensus on why all the related technological and scientific progress mentioned\nabove has not yet yielded AI software systems with human-like general intelligence (or even\ngreater levels of brilliance!). However, we hypothesize that the core reason boils down to the\nfollowing three points:\n\ne Intelligence depends on the emergence of certain high-level structures and dynamics across\na system’s whole knowledge base;\n\ne We have not discovered any one algorithm or approach capable of yielding the emergence\nof these structures;\n\ne Achieving the emergence of these structures within a system formed by integrating a number\nof different ATI algorithms and structures requires careful attention to the manner in which\n\n| This brings up a terminological note: At several places in this Volume and the next we will refer to the current\nCogPrime or OpenCog implementation; in all cases this refers to OpenCog as of late 2013.

I kept\nrunning into both of them, separately, at parties. Jeffrey is not a social animal so he usually has a couple of\nyoung women with him who stand two feet behind him, as if serving a monarch. “Do they speak?” I remember\nasking him once, nodding at his lookalike blondes. He laughed. “Not like you, Vicky,” was his riposte.\n\nI remembered that when we'd once discussed math—in particular, an isosceles triangle—and I revealed I hadn’t\nstudied math since I was 14 (such is, or was, the way of the British educational system), I received a package at\nhome via messenger. It was a book: “Math for idiots.”\n\nSo he is not without humor, even though he doesn’t drink or smoke, and hates restaurants.\n\n“Jeffrey knows a good deal about most subjects,” newspaper publisher Mort Zuckerman told me last week. He\nwas certainly preaching to the converted. The truth is, Epstein does know a lot about a lot of things. Just a few\nmoments in his company and you know this to be true.\n\nWhen I saw pictures of Prince Andrew walking in Central Park with Jeffrey, my immediate thought was that\n“Andy’—as Jeffrey calls him—is probably asking for help with his role as British trade envoy, or whatever his\nstrange title is. Because if one thing’s for sure: When it comes to international business, Jeffrey knows what\nhe’s talking about far more than “Andy” does. Which is why Leon Black, Mort Zuckerman and a few other\nfinanciers hang out with him.\n\nAnd Ghislaine?\nFull disclosure: I like her. Most people in New York do. It’s almost impossible not to.\n\nShe is always the most interesting, the most vivacious, the most unusual person in any room. I’ve spent hours\ntalking to her about the third world at a bar until 2am. She is as passionate as she is knowledgeable. She is\ncurious. She has spent weeks at the bottom of the ocean, literally going deeper than anyone else. She has sent\nme a DVD of the fish there. Her rolodex would blow away almost anyone else’s I can think of—probably even\nRupert Murdochs’. She is very well-read and can talk about most things for hours. She is passionate about Bill\nClinton with whom she is close friends.\n\nYet, touchingly, when she had to give a speech at the 4oth birthday party of her best friend, Ariadne Calvo-\nPlatero, (known fondly to her close friends as “the Tennis Goddess”) Ghislaine shook a little with nerves. When\nit comes down to things she really cares about—and Ariadne is one of them—Ghislaine shows her vulnerability.\nAnd that vulnerability is key to understanding her friendship with Jeffrey.\n\n“He saved her,” I remember a close friend of mine telling me. “When her father died, she was a wreck;\ninconsolable. And then Jeffrey took her in. She’s never forgotten that—and never will.”\n\nIn many ways, the socially awkward Epstein with his big house, plane, island and ranch was the perfect\nreplacement for her father, the late Robert Maxwell, newspaper tycoon and criminal. Sure, Jeffrey had his\nsexual pecadillos, but then Ghislaine’s father was not without his oddities. After all, it was he who died leaving\na massive “black hole” he’d fraudulently created. To Ghislaine, Jeffrey's habits may not have seemed that\nstrange.\n\nIn fact, she probably figured, rather like I have, after years of writing about he very rich, that most successful\npeople in the end either have some weird habit (the late Bruce Wasserstein had the weight issues, the girl\nissues, and moved countries to avoid paying tax), or they break the law (Sam Waksal, Martha Stewart.) You\ndon’t tend to get to the top by being the world’s most balanced human being. Even the folksy Warren Buffett\ndidn’t quite manage a normal life—whatever that is. He had a second “wife” for many years whose existence he\nhas been open about.\n\nSo what to make of the current fuss over Ghislaine? I haven’t spoken to her or to Jeffrey, but I suspect that her\n\nloyalty to friends like Bill Clinton will keep her in good stead, in the end, she'll be out and about as always. Look\nat Waksal and Stewart. No one sees them and thinks: criminal. Au contraire.

Here it is\nfemales who compete to prove the same better genes that males just proved in the\n\ntournaments or beauty contests.\n\nThe race against parasites speeds up again with Trivers’ fine insight about healthier\nmothers choosing to dial up the ratio of sons to daughters (“primary sex ratio”), and\nto expand the reproductive period at both ends with shorter birth spacing for more\nmale offspring still. (Some of this may be my idea rather than his.) Nature proves\nbest current genes twice. Fathers prove them by duking it out or strutting their stuff.\nMothers carrying the same best genes prove it by winning the breeding contest\n\nagainst other mothers after.\n\nThe ex ante/ ex post distinction counts as much in biology as in economics. Here it\naccelerates the selection process. Offspring carrying the antidote gene to meet\ncurrent parasites will generally not on that account cost more ex ante invested\nconsumption to raise. If they are males, who can turn that advantage into many\noffspring, the ex post value of that same investment can be far higher. The converse\nworks for offspring lacking the gene. Their mothers can make the best of it by\nproducing females who will find breeding opportunities anyhow with mates\ncarrying the gene, since she knows which they are and males always have cheap\n\nsperm to spare, and will so keep their own genes in the gene pool.\nParasites got the last laugh by killing Hamilton on research in Africa a few years\nafter I met him. | never knew well enough to call him Bill.

In response to Roberts’ description of Dershowitz’s participation in\nEpstein’s sex trafficking, Dershowitz began a series of intentional, outright lies designed to\ndistance himself from Epstein, to cover up his own wrongdoing, and to discredit Roberts and\nintimidate her into silence.\n\n54. Dershowitz’s repeated lies are compelling evidence both of his lack of credibility\nand his guilt. Only a person seeking to conceal improper conduct would have engaged in the\npattern of lies which has characterized Dershowitz’s statements since his sex trafficking was\nrevealed.\n\n55, In attempt to conceal his relationship with Epstein, Dershowitz in January 2015\nasserted that “my relationship with him was entirely professional. It is a total bum rap to say that\nI...was ‘chummy’ with him”. (Exhibit 11). That was a lie, as Dershowitz and Epstein knew (see,\ne.g., paragraphs 34-35).\n\n56. Both to conceal Dershowitz’s relationship with Epstein, and to discredit Roberts,\nDershowitz has repeatedly asserted that he was only at Epstein’s residence once in Palm Beach,\nand that was with his family. However, Juan Alessi, a long time Epstein household employee,\nhas confirmed that Dershowitz visited Epstein “pretty often. I would say at least four or five\ntimes a year” and that he would “typically” stay two or three days. Similarly, Alfredo Rodriguez\nwho worked for Epstein approximately only six months confirmed that during that six months\n\nperiod Dershowitz visited Epstein twice.\n\n14\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_017948\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

We need to think about education in a new way. Rather\nthan wanting people to be educated, which usually means being able\nto quote Shakespeare or nod sagely when Freud’s name is mentioned,\nwe need to expect people to be able to think well. Education would be\nbetter defined by defining an educated person as one who can make\nwell-reasoned arguments for what they are about to do.\n\nWe must focus on teaching cognitive processes and abandoning\nthe subject-based (and test-based) education system we have now that\nis clearly failing. The reason we have all those tests is simply because\nwe have no idea how to make people learn all the stuff that is part of\nthat subject-based system without threatening them. No one really\nwants to learn the Pythagorean theorem or information about the Taft\nHartley Act. Let scholars know about these things; the average person\njust doesn’t need to know this stuff.\n\nBut all people do know how to find and use the mathematics they\nneed when they have continually practiced it, and they know how to\nfind prior relevant experiences when they have to come up with a new\nplan they want to propose. That simply does not mean we have to tell\nit all to them years before they might ever make use of it.\n\nIn the age of the Internet, just-in-time learning is a serious reality.\nWe can change things now in part because we have information read-\nily available online.

Dershowitz\nAlan M. Dershowitz is a Professor of Law emeritus at Harvard Law School.\n\nDecember 5, 2018\nTo the editor,\n\nThe Crimson story regarding Jeffrey Epstein omitted the central point I made in my interview\nwith the reporter. I welcome an investigation by Harvard or any other institution, including\nprosecutors, into the wilfully false charges made by Virginia Roberts for financial gain. Omitting\nthis crucial statement is irresponsible and unethical journalism.\n\nVirginia Roberts leveled her false accusations four years ago. At the time, I disproved them\ncategorically. The matter was put to rest, with even her lawyers admitting that it was a mistake\nand wrong. Then four years later the Miami Herald recycled this false accusation and The\nCrimson reported on the Herald’s recycled report. I wrote a letter to the editor of the Herald\npointing to the incontrovertible evidence that Roberts made up the accusation out of whole\n\ncloth in order to obtain millions of dollars from Leslie Wexner.\n\nI was able to disprove Roberts’ false accusation by producing all of my travel, AmEx, and TV\nappearance records which showed where I was, and, more importantly, where I wasn’t during\nthe entire period Virginia Roberts was in contact with Jeffrey Epstein. These records prove\nincontrovertibly that I could not have been, and was not, where Roberts’ falsely claimed to have\nmet me — a Caribbean Island, a New Mexico Ranch, a private jet, a Palm Beach mansion —\n\nduring the relevant time period.\n\nI also called for an independent investigation by the former Director of the F.B.I., a highly\nrespected former federal judge and assistant U.S. attorney. He reviewed all of the records and\nother evidence and concluded that “the totality of the evidence ... refutes the allegations.”\n\nhttns:/Awww thecrimson com/article/2018/12/5/letter-dershowit7-misrenresention/ 1/9\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_017790\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

Now, I was about to become the first\nof his successors to have been chosen from within the unit itself. As I called\ntogether the officers that first morning, I couldn’t be sure whether I would make\na success of my two years in command. But I did know what I hoped that I, and\nwe, would accomplish: to complete Avraham’s vision. To forge a true special-\nforces unit, at a time when the threats facing Israel seemed increasingly to\ndemand one.\n\nAvraham’s initial hopes and expectations for the unit had been more than\nmet. Sayeret Matkal had played the key role in erasing the traumas of Uri Ilan\nand Rotem, and restoring the morale and effectiveness of Israeli military\nintelligence. Time and again, operations which we said we could do — dismissed\nas too dangerous, or impossible, by others — proved achievable. Yet as I now\ntold the team leaders and our other officers, this was no longer enough.\n\nOur intelligence operations still mattered. In fact, we would have to “push\nfurther” across Arab borders, deeper into enemy communications systems. Our\nintercepts had given Israel an important edge in the Six-Day War. I assumed —\nthough naively, it would turn out — that they would be put to use in any future\nwar. But if the sayeret was to retain its unique role, we had to become a fighting\nforce as well. One reason, I didn’t even have to mention: we all remembered our\nfrustration in 1967, when we’d been little more than bit players in the most\nimportant conflict since the establishment of the state. But for me, the main\nargument for change was what had happened since the 1967 war: the fact that\nIsrael was facing a new range of security challenges which other army units,\ntrained to engage and defeat enemy troops on the battlefield, were not equipped\nto meet.\n\nIn the War of Attrition, we might not have lost a single inch of territory. But\nwe had lost tanks and planes. Israeli soldiers and pilots were being held prisoner\nin Egypt and Syria. Arafat’s Fatah and the other armed Palestinian groups might\nnot present a conventional threat. Yet while I’d been with my tank company in\nthe Sinai, they were fighting a full-scale civil war against King Hussein’s army\nin Jordan. The catalyst: a multiple hijacking in September 1970, a sign that they\nwere turning to non-conventional warfare, and to acts of terror.\n\n111\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_027959\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

This strong\nconsumer interest is validated by the growing number of brands and form factors that are\nnow available through increasingly diverse retail channels, including Amazon, Sephora and\nNeiman Marcus. That said, consumption of CBD on-premise will likely take longer, given\nregulatory uncertainty. And, while our analysis primarily focuses on consumer staples\napplications for CBD, it is interesting to see a growing number of specialty apparel brands\nembrace hemp as a sustainable textile.\n\nRetail sales of CBD consumer products in 2018 have been estimated between ~$600 mm\nand $2 bn. By 2025, we believe CBD offerings could conservatively generate $16 bn in retail\nsales (assuming a ~40% increase in consumer incidence, to 10%, and spend of less than $2 /\nday). Our bottom-up analysis anticipates a diverse category, that is still led by traditional\nhealth & wellness form factors (e.g., $6.4 bn in nutraceuticals, and $4 bn in topicals). And,\nwhile likely smaller, we also expect categories like food, beverages, beauty and vapor to all\ngenerate sales between ~$1-2.5 bn by 2025.\n\nHerein, we offer a detailed look at category brand and pricing architecture in the U.S.\n\nCBD market today, as well as detailed discussions of 21 public and private operators that\ncurrently have exposure to the category, including Outperform rated Canopy Growth, Tilray\nand Turning Point Brands, which have all announced plans to enter the U.S. CBD market.\n\nThe Science of CBD (Nadeau)\n\nCannabis’s therapeutic potential is attributable to the valuable overlap between\nphytocannabinoids (i.e. plant-derived cannabinoids) and the endogenous cannabinoid\nsystem in humans, termed a “therapeutic handshake.” While THC's activity in the body is\nfairly well elucidated, CBD’s pharmacokinetics are less well understood (no specific receptor\nfor CBD has been identified). Clinical trial results to date demonstrate few adverse effects\nfrom oral CBD doses of up to 1500 mg/day or up to 30mg IV. The scientific understanding\nof CBD’s clinical effects is based mostly on studies in specific indications, like epilepsy. GW\nPharma’s Epidiolex (highly potent, pure formulation of CBD) was approved by the FDA in\n2018 for the treatment of seizures associated with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome and Dravet\nsyndrome, and other companies (Tilray, MMJ Phytotech, Insys) have clinical trials underway\nin seizure disorders as well.\n\nCBD Hemp Cultivation (Neivert)\n\nAccording to the National Conference of State Legislatures, 41 states have set up cultivation\nand production programs to regulate the production of hemp. There is little research on\nCBD hemp cultivation methods as hemp cultivation research historically has focused on\nfiber and grain/seed. This lack of research, combined with a number of variables that affect\nhemp for CBD yield, makes hemp for CBD cultivation much more art than science at this\npoint. That said, no other crop in the U.S. offers the type of return of the CBD Plasticulture\nModel, and we would thus expect the country's two largest crops, corn and soybeans, to\nlose some acreage to CBD hemp.\n\nCOWEN.COM\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_024819\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

Only five months\nafter the election, Rabin and I faced one of the most painful periods during my\nentire time as chief of staff. It began with the gruesome death of five Sayeret\nMatkal soldiers during a training exercise in the Negev desert. I’d made\npreventing such accidents a top priority. By the end of the 1980s, they were\nclaiming as many as 80 lives a year. During Dan’s tenure, we’d brought the\nnumber down to about 35. But I knew we had to do more. When I’d addressed\nthe officers after becoming chief of staff, I told them: “Parents are giving us\ntheir children in order to allow us to protect the country. They know there is risk\ninvolved. But they expect their children not to be brought home in coffins\nbecause of our own negligence, or stupidity.” What happened at the military\nbase of Tze’elim in the Negev on November 5, 1992 was not only a reminder of\nhow far we still had to go, however. It occurred during a dry run for an\noperation unlike any that Israel had ever considered. For that and other reasons,\nit would erupt into a major political controversy.\n\nThough the reason for the exercise was meant to have remained a closely\nguarded secret, foreign newspaper reports in the weeks after the training\naccident made secrecy impossible. We were planning to infiltrate a Sayeret\nMatkal unit into Iraq, and to kill Saddam Hussein.\n\nThe Gulf War had blunted any immediate threat from Iraq. But Saddam had\nproven he could launch missiles into the heart of Israel. We knew from our\nintelligence reports that, in addition to his unabated desire to acquire nuclear\narms, he retained facilities to produce chemical weapons. He was trying to\nacquire and develop new biological weapons. In fact, the Iraqis had actually\nacknowledged a biological weapons program to UN inspectors, claiming it was\nfor “defensive purposes.”\n\nThe idea for an attack on Saddam had first been raised a year earlier, when\nmy former Sayeret Matkal comrade, Amiram Levin, asked to see me. He was\nbetween military postings, but had come up with the outline of a plan he felt\nwould allow us to isolate Saddam during a public appearance and kill him. With\nmy approval, he and a small group of officers in the sayeret began working\nfurther on the idea, with the initial aim of seeing whether it was really workable.\nSince Misha was still Defense Minister, I briefed him on what we were doing.

INTERNATIONAL FINANCE CORP.\n\nSyllabus\n\ncontinuously equivalent. The IOIA is thus like other statutes that\nuse similar or identical language to place two groups on equal foot-\ning. See, e.g., Civil Rights Act of 1866, 42 U.S. C. §§1981(a), 1982;\nFederal Tort Claims Act, 28 U.S. C. §2674. Whatever the ultimate\npurpose of international organization immunity may be, the immedi-\nate purpose of the IJOIA immunity provision is expressed in language\nthat Congress typically uses to make one thing continuously equiva-\nlent to another. Pp. 6-9.\n\n(b) That reading is confirmed by the “reference canon” of statutory\ninterpretation. When a statute refers to a general subject, the stat-\nute adopts the law on that subject as it exists whenever a question\nunder the statute arises. In contrast, when a statute refers to anoth-\ner statute by specific title, the referenced statute is adopted as it ex-\nisted when the referring statute was enacted, without any subse-\nquent amendments. Federal courts have often relied on the reference\ncanon to harmonize a statute with an external body of law that the\nstatute refers to generally. The IOJTA’s reference to the immunity en-\njoyed by foreign governments is to an external body of potentially\nevolving law, not to a specific provision of another statute. Nor is ita\nspecific reference to a common law concept with a fixed meaning.\nThe phrase “immunity enjoyed by foreign governments” is not a term\nof art with substantive content but rather a concept that can be given\nscope and content only by reference to the rules governing foreign\nsovereign immunity. Pp. 9-11.\n\n(c) The D. C. Circuit relied upon Atkinson’s conclusion that the ref-\nerence canon’s probative force was outweighed by an IOJA provision\nauthorizing the President to alter the immunity of an international\norganization. But the fact that the President has power to modify\notherwise applicable immunity rules is perfectly compatible with the\nnotion that those rules might themselves change over time in light of\ndevelopments in the law governing foreign sovereign immunity. The\nAtkinson court also did not consider the opinion of the State Depart-\nment, whose views in this area ordinarily receive “special attention,”\nBolivarian Republic of Venezuela v. Helmerich & Payne Int'l Drilling\nCo., 581 U.S. __, __, and which took the position that immunity\nrules of the IOIA and the FSIA were linked following the FSIA’s en-\nactment. Pp. 11-13.\n\n(d) The IFC contends that interpreting the IOIA immunity provi-\nsion to grant only restrictive immunity would defeat the purpose of\ngranting immunity in the first place, by subjecting international or-\nganizations to suit under the commercial activity exception of the\nFSIA for most or all of their core activities. This would be particular-\nly true with respect to international development banks, which use\nthe tools of commerce to achieve their objectives.

Even if the probability of a chemical attack was microscopic, any risk\nof civilians being subjected to terror, panic and very possibly agonizing death\nmeant that the government had to take precautions. The obvious first step would\nbe to distribute gas masks. But in a series of meetings with Misha and Dan, I\nemphasized this was not a decision that could be taken in isolation.

I took this as an opportunity, not as a problem, since fac-\nulty want to teach the way they always have taught. Lecturing is easy\nand faculty like to do it. Students have learned to cope with lectur-\ning and later cramming for tests, so no one complains much. No one\nlearns much from this, but no one seems to be too concerned about it.\n\nI was asked to design master’s degree programs in computer sci-\nence. It seemed to me that students entered a master’s degree program\nbecause they wanted to get a good job after graduation, so I asked\nwhat jobs they were preparing for as I looked at each Pittsburgh cam-\npus program. Even though the faculty in Pittsburgh had been teach-\ning these master’s degree programs for years, faculty members were\nsurprisingly unconcerned with what students did after graduation.\nThey just taught their courses, their specialties actually, and assumed\nthe students would find value in them. This seemed an odd state of\naffairs to anyone who looked at it from the outside, but as professor I\nknow that faculty are rarely concerned with master’s degree students\nat all and naturally wouldn’t have given these programs that much\nthought.\n\nThere was a great deal of hostility to the SCCs that were built by\nmy team and me. They were seen as threatening the existing structure\nof courses and lectures. Nevertheless, the students liked them a great\ndeal and the people who mentored in them, after some initial resis-\ntance, began to like them and promote them.

Students learn actual skills and teach-\ners feel like they are helping students do something real. But faculty,\nwho are used to the old classroom-style method, often resist doing the\nhard work now required of them. This is true for students as well. One\nmentor in the West Coast e-business program who himself had gradu-\nated from the Pittsburgh classroom-based program said that he felt\nsorry for the kids on the West Coast campus because they had to work\nso hard. He noted that they were learning a lot more than he did but\nthat he had liked sitting in the back of the classroom and ignoring the\nteacher.

The designated theme —\ngoverning through the rule of law — indicates how important\nthis meeting will be for the future of both the Party and the\ncountry.\n\nThat this is the first time in 17 years the Party has designated\nsuch a theme for a plenary session speaks volumes about the\nimportance the new leadership attaches to it. It is high on the\nagenda.\n\nYet, the more the concept of rule of law has been discussed,\nthe more obvious it becomes that there is, today, much to be\ndesired.\n\nMore than 50 minister-level or higher officials have either\nbeen indicted or placed under investigation for abuse of power\nin the past year or so, underlining the fact that the rule of lawis\nsorely needed. It is perhaps the only way to eliminate, once\nand for all, the most serious threat to good governance and to\nsecure the blessings of prosperity and justice to the people.\n\nThe fact that power today can effectively nullify the law, and\nthat those in power can circumvent it, not only deprives the\nParty of its capacity to govern the country in a consistently fair\nand just manner but also disrupts the reasonable running of\nthe marketplace. Abuse of power makes it impossible for fair-\nness to prevail in the socialist market economy.\n\nDespite the great achievements China has made over more\nthan three decades, it will be very difficult for its economy to\ngrow in a sound manner — and neither will society progress in\na healthy way — unless fair competition and mutual trust can\nbe secured and ordinary people’s rights and interests can be\nguaranteed through the rule of law.\n\nIf the country is to achieve further reforms in various fields\nand establish and maintain a fair and just society, the power-\nworshipping mentality among government and Party officials\nmust be eliminated. This is a core goal of the leadership.\n\nUnless the overwhelming majority of Party and government\nofficials not only respect the law, but follow it when making\ndecisions, governing the country by the rule of law will\namount to little but lip service.\n\nIt will be no easy job, and it will take time for the power-ori-\nented way of doing things to be transformed. But the new Par-\nty leadership has shown it has the courage to face the\nchallenge. We therefore have reason to expect much from the\ncurrent plenary session as they work to put the country on the\nright track.\n\nOTHER VIEWS\n\nHistoric moment\n\nhe convocation of the Fourth Plenary Session of the 18th Com-\nmunist Party of China Central Committee, whose theme is\npromoting the rule of law, embodies the CPC’s deepening percep-\n\ntion on governance and the law.\nwww.people.com.cn October 15.\n\ntis the first time that the CPC, as the ruling Party, will make a\n\ncomprehensive plan on the rule of law in the form of a Party doc-\nument. The session, which marks the ruling Party’s significant\nstrategic layout on how to govern the nation in accordance with\nJaws and the Constitution, illustrates its new exploration of social-\nism with Chinese characteristics. The CPC Central Committee will\nfocus on discussions on how to promote rule of law in at a plenary\nsession. ...\n\nIt has only six years to 2020, the deadline set for the realization\nof a well-off society for China, and 35 years to 2049, the promised\nyear for China to be a prosperous, democratic, civilized and har-\nmonious socialist modern nation. All these mean China has\nentered a crucial stage of deepened reforms. Only by sticking to\n“governance of the nation according to laws” will China realize its\nhistoric mission.\n\nwww.xinhuanet.com.cn October 19.\n\nhe National People’s Congress, China’s top legislature, should\nplay a bigger role in the country’s efforts to promote the rule of\nlaw.

Can analyzing\nthe book elucidate Xi’s thinking\nand illuminate China’s future?\nConsider seven frameworks or\nperspectives: publishing purpos-\nes, overarching themes, content analysis, chain of\ndevelopmental causation, domestic goals, domes-\ntic means and global principles.\n\nPublishing Purposes: substance,\nsymbol, signal. Substance means Xi's political phi-\nlosophy and wide-ranging policies — organizing 79\nspeeches and commentaries in 18 chapters — to\ndiscern how Xi intends to realize the Chinese\nDream, “the great rejuvenation of the Chinese\nnation’: Symbol means recognizing Xi’s emergence\nas China’s leader, with greater authority, confi-\ndence and support than observers had expected\nwhen he first took office two years ago. Signal\nMeans communicating Xi’s way of thinking to\nglobal audiences in nine languages, an original\nand explicit outreach to engage the world on mul-\ntiple levels.\n\nOverarching Themes: pride, stability, respon-\nsibility, vision. Pride expresses the yearning of the\nChinese people for the “great rejuvenation” Stabili-\nty means maintaining the current political system.\n(Socialism with Chinese characteristics and the\nParty’s leadership). Responsibility means “realiz-\ning a moderately prosperous society by the centen-\nary of the Party in 2021” Vision means “turning\nChina into a prosperous, democratic, culturally\nadvanced and harmonious modern socialist coun-\ntry by the centenary of the People’s Republic of\nChina in 2049”\n\nContent Analysis. How does Xi impute impor-\ntance to topics? By examining what's in Xi’s book,\ncan we explore what's on Xi’s mind? Of the book’s\n18 chapters, 11 relate to domestic affairs, seven to\nforeign affairs; six have political relevance; six con-\ncern standards of living; and four standards of\n\nLI MIN\n\nFU JING\n\nbehavior. Categorizing the content, about a third is\npolitics and people; another third on international\nrelations; about 15 percent each on reform and\ndevelopment, and society and culture; and about 8\npercent on national security and defense. Perva-\nsive throughout is reform.\n\nChain of Developmental Causation. The\nChinese Dream is founded on political stability,\nwhich enables far-reaching reform, which in turn.\npromotes economic development, and which,\nwhen combined with rule of law and Chinese val-\nues, strengthens China’s society, culture, ecology\nand even defense. Where is this “chain of causa-\ntion” in Xi’s book?\n\nThe first and last chapters affirm political stabili-\nty: “Socialism with Chinese Characteristics” and\n“The CPC Leadership’, both of which assert the\nParty’s political primacy and thus assure social sta-\nbility. “The Chinese Dream” is the second chapter,\nproclaiming the grand mission of national resur-\ngence and personal well-being. Then, chapters on.\ndeepening reform and economic development,\nwhich lead to chapters on rule of law, advanced cul-\nture, social undertakings and ecological progress.\n\nDomestic Goals: values, morality, prosperity,\nSairness, happiness. Values: Xi's vision is to incul-\ncate China’s traditional values — “the thoughts of\nthe ancient sages”; exemplified by Confucianism —\ninto socialist core values. (“We must take tradition-\nal Chinese culture as the base.”) Morality: Derived\nfrom values, morality is described as “conscious\nlaw’, and “civic morality” is characterized as need-\ning improvement, while “paragons of morality are\nimportant banners for building public ethics” (“A\ngentleman takes morality as his bedrock” — a tra-\nditional virtue that Xi quotes.) Prosperity: “Com-\nmon prosperity is the fundamental principle of\nChinese socialism ... We will accelerate China’s\noverall prosperity” Fairness: Because the Chinese\npeople have always had a perception that “inequal-\nity rather than want is the cause of trouble”, Xi\nsays, China “should do a better job of promoting\n\nfairness and justice” Happiness: The Chinese\nDream, Xi says, is to “bring happiness to the Chi-\nnese people” to “ensure the people greater happi-\nness” — but, he cautions, “happiness does not fall\nfrom the sky, nor do dreams come true automati-\ncally.’ (In Xi’s book, “values” occurs about 120\ntimes, “morality” 24, “prosperity” 67, “fairness” 44.\nand “happiness” 16.)\n\nDomestic Means: close to the people, realism,\nstability, reform, rule of law, combating corrup-\ntion. “Close to the people” is an all-encompassing\nway of thinking that shapes all decisions. Realism:\n“T have repeatedly said that the great rejuvenation\nof the Chinese nation can in no way be realized\neasily,’ Xi says. “While fully affirming our achieve-\nments, we should also be aware of our shortcom-\nings.” Stability: The precondition for all else,\nstability is a recurrent and foundational theme\n(“stability” occurs 125 times). Reform: Those who\nwonder whether Xi is a “real reformer” should\nread “Explanatory Notes ... Concerning Compre-\nhensively Continuing Reform” (page 76). Exam-\nples: the market plays a “decisive role”; farmers\ngiven transactional property rights; the judicial\nsystem separate from the administrative system.\nRule of Law: “A fundamental principle” and “the\nbasic way to run the country” — the Fourth Plena-\nry of the 18th CPC Central Committee, focusing on\ntule of law, is Xi’s call to action. Combating corrup-\ntion is a hallmark of Xi’s administration, enhanc-\ning each of the five other domestic means. It is no\naccident that the chapter on combating corruption.\nis positioned, significantly, between “Close Ties\nwith the People” and “The CPC Leadership”\n\nIbear witness to Xi’s consistency. In 2006, Adam\nZhu (my long-term partner) and I met privately\nwith then-Zhejiang Party Secretary Xi. He stressed\nthat while China should be properly proud of its\nsuccesses, “achievements should not engender\ncomplacency” Xi said: “We need to assess our-\nselves objectively”\n\nGlobal Principles. Consider five. Independ-\nence (China remains unaligned). Multi-polar\nworld (no country dominates). One country, two\nsystems (Hong Kong, Macao, Taiwan). Peaceful\ndevelopment (“We have made a solemn pledge to\nthe whole world that we will never seek hegemo-\nny”). Multilateral affairs (cooperation with the\nglobal community). These five global principles\ndrive China's “new model of major country rela-\ntions” (primarily with the US), “neighborhood\ndiplomacy” (Japan, Vietnam, Koreas, etc.), and\n“cooperation with developing countries” (such as\nin Africa). The Silk Road economic belt (land route\nand maritime) is President Xi’s new initiative for\nmultinational development.\n\nHere’s my blurb for Xi’s book: “This book is a\nmilestone, both in substance and symbol, offering\nopenly the political philosophy of President Xi Jin-\nping and recognizing his emergence as China’s\nsenior leader. While misunderstandings about\nChina and its leadership abound, there is now no\nneed to speculate about President Xi. Here is how\nhe thinks, candidly and comprehensively.’ It is the\npride of a patriot.\n\nThe author is an international corporate strate-\ngist and political/economics commentator. He is\nthe author of How China’s Leaders Think and a\nbiography of former president Jiang Zemin. He\ngave one of the speeches at the launching ceremo-\nny for Xi Jinping: The Governance of China, at\nthe Frankfurt Book Fair on Oct 8.\n\nCourtesy, not confrontation, best for Europe\n\ninister of Commerce Gao Hucheng\narrived in the lobby of the European\nCommission's headquarters at 9\no'clock on Saturday morning. He was\nJed to the office of outgoing Trade Commissioner\nKarel De Gucht, who has been a thorn in the side\nof Chinese businesses because of his protectionist\nattitude ever since he took over the job in 2010.\n\nDe Gucht, 60, will be replaced in a few days by\nSwedish politician Cecilia Malmstrom, 46, when.\nanewly constituted commission gets underway.\n\nIn the afternoon, the Chinese side announced a\nlong-awaited agreement in principle: Brussels\nwill not launch an investigation into subsidies of\nChina’s telecommunication imports into the\nEuropean market. The EU side still needs to go\nthrough internal procedures for formal approval.\nThe threat was mainly targeted at Chinese tele-\ncommunications equipment makers Huawei\nTechnologies Co and ZTE Corp.\n\nWhile the big picture of relations has been a\npositive one, the Europeans have annoyed Beijing\nfrom time to time — for example, by allowing the\nDalai Lama to visit, by attacking China on human\nrights and by imposing high trade barriers.\n\nDespite such irritants, Beijing has sent con-\nstructive signals. In the first half of this year, Pres-\nident Xi Jinping paid the first-ever visit of a\nChinese president to the European Union's head-\nquarters. And last week, at the summit of Asian\nand European leaders in Milan, Italy, Premier Li\nKeqiang hosted a special dinner for Barroso and\nEuropean Council President Herman Van Rom-\npuy, thanking them for their contributions to pos-\n\nitive relations. At the dinner, the leaders were\nthought to have touched on the telecommunica-\ntion trade dispute, which involves about 1 billion\neuros ($1.26 billion) annually.\n\nThe path to Saturday's solution was similar toa\npattern set earlier, in mid-2013, after both sides\nworked through an anti-dumping and anti-subsi-\ndy investigation involving China’s multi-billion-\ndollar solar panel exports to the EU. Brussels\nbegan that investigation in 2012.\n\nBeijing was unhappy that there had been no\nhigh-level invitation to visit Brussels a year after\nthe launch of the investigation.\n\nIn May last year, Li made his first trip to Ger-\nmany after taking office and won the support of\nthe German government, which vetoed Brussels’\ndecision, following dozens of EU member states.\n\nLi made a last-minute call on Barroso the fol-\nlowing month, as Brussels was about to vote on\nwhether to end the solar panel dispute through\namicable consultation.\n\nLi’s decisive role was crucial in preventing the\nescalation of a trade war. If Beijing had opted to\ndeal with such disputes in an eye-for-eye, tooth-\nfor-tooth manner, both sides would have been\nlosers, with the EU taking the brunt. It has\nalready suffered two economic recessions, and\nits jobless rate has been in double digits for a\nfew years now.\n\nOf course, with the trade volume between Chi-\nnaand Europe expanding, and with investment\npouring into Europe, China’s government, its\nbusinesses and its media must work to make the\nmost of the rising economic tide.\n\nSo far, there is no unified Chinese business\ncouncil in Brussels to represent and lobby for\nChinese investors in Europe. By contrast, a major\nUS business organization reportedly has 300 staff\nmembers focusing on Brussels’ policymaking.\n\nAlack of communication and influence can\neasily lead to misunderstandings. Bureaucrats in\nBrussels usually follow Washington's lead when\nmaking policies that affect China.\n\nTrade commission leaders need to make more\nfield trips to member states to learn how Chinese\nbusinesses matter.\n\nTake China’s solar panel exports for example.\nThe industry, which involves about 400,000\nworkers in China, has offered competitive prod-\nucts to thousands of European upstream compa-\nnies and helped Europe achieve its status as a\ngreen energy leader.\n\nIn telecom, Huawei and ZTE are deeply inte-\ngrated with European partners. And, incidentally,\nHuawei is a steady job creator in Europe, where\nyoung people, in particular, have faced huge\nemployment challenges.\n\nIf De Gucht had kept the big picture in mind,\nhe would not have made confrontational moves\nagainst China and its businesses.\n\nOverall, the EU recognizes China as strong stra-\ntegic partner. This is the starting point for dispute\ncontrol. Amicability helps both sides win. With\nconfrontation, everyone loses.\n\nThe author is China Daily chief\n\ncorrespondent in Brussels.\nSujing @chinadaily.com.cn\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_023699\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

One\nperson who worked for Wexner and who saw a contract drawn up between the two men says\nEpstein is involved in “everything, not just a little here, a little there. Everything!” In addition, he\nsays, “Wexner likes having a hatchet man.... Whenever there is dirty work to be done he’d stick\nJeffrey on it.... He has a reputation for being ruthless but he gets the job done.”\n\nEpstein has evidently been asked to fire personal-staff members when needed. “He was that\nmysterious person that everyone was scared to death of,” says a former employee.\n\nMeanwhile, he is also less than popular with some people outside Wexner’s company with\nwhom he now deals. “He ‘inserted’ himself into the construction process of Leslie Wexner’s\nyacht.... That resulted in litigation down the road between Mr. Wexner and the shipyard that\neventually built the vessel,” says Lars Forsberg, a lawyer whose firm at the time, Dickerson and\nReily, was hired to deal with litigation stemming from the construction of Wexner’s Limitless—\nat 315 feet, one of the largest private yachts in the world. Evidently, Epstein stalled on paying\nDickerson and Reily for its work. “It’s probably once or twice in my legal career that I’ve had to\nsue a client for payment of services that he’d requested and we’d performed ... without issue on\nthe performance,” says Forsberg. In the end the matter was settled, but Epstein claims he now\nhas no recollection of it.\n\nThe incident is one of a number of disputes Epstein has become embroiled in. Some are for sums\nso tiny as to be baffling; for instance, Epstein sued investment adviser Herbert Glass, who sold\nhim the Palm Beach house in 1990, for $13,444—Epstein claimed this was owed him for\nfurnishings removed by Glass.\n\nIn 1998 the U.S. Attorney’s Office sued Epstein for illegally subletting the former home of the\ndeputy consul general of Iran to attorney Ivan Fisher and others. Epstein paid $15,000 a month in\nrent to the State Department, but he charged Fisher and his colleagues $20,000. Though the exact\nterms of the agreement are sealed, the court ruled against Epstein.\n\nWexner offers some insight into his friend’s combative style. “Many times people confuse\nwinning and losing,” Wexner says. “Jeffrey has the unusual quality of knowing when he is\nwinning. Whether in conversations or negotiations, he always stands back and lets the other\nperson determine the style and manner of the conversation or negotiation. And then he responds\nin their style. Jeffrey sees it in chivalrous terms. He does not pick a fight, but if there is a fight,\nhe will let you choose your weapon.”\n\nOne case is rather more serious. Currently, Citibank is suing Epstein for defaulting on loans from\nits private-banking arm for $20 million. Epstein claims that Citibank “fraudulently induced” him\ninto borrowing the money for investments. Citibank disputes this charge.\n\nThe legal papers for another case offer a rare window into Epstein’s finances. In 1995, Epstein\nstopped paying rent to his landlord, the nonprofit Municipal Arts Society, for his office in the\nVillard House. He claimed that they were breaking the terms of the lease by not letting his staff\nin at night. The case was eventually settled. However, one of the papers filed in this dispute 1s\nEpstein’s financial statement for 1988, in which he claimed to be worth $20 million.

The government does.”--\nAdmiral Michael McConnell, Vice Chairman of Booz Allen Hamilton\n\nSnowden, age 26, returned from Europe and moved into his mother’s condo. He was not only\nunemployed now, having resigned the CIA without qualifying for any benefits, but his financial\nstate had been hurt by the huge losses he had suffered playing the options market in Geneva. His\nvision of himself as a secret agent, the unstoppable “Wolfking Awesomefox” may have also\nsuffered. According to the narrative he later supplied to the Guardian, he had become deeply\nconcerned about the immoral way in which the CIA conducted its intelligence operations in\nSwitzerland. \"Much of what I saw in Geneva really disillusioned me about how my government\nfunctions and what its impact is in the world. I realized that I was part of something that was\ndoing far more harm than good,\" Snowden told the Guardian. By way of example, he said he\nlearned that the CIA had gotten a Swiss banker drunk enough arrested to be arrested when he\ndrove, so the CIA could compromise him. Snowden, who did not drink himself, was appalled at\nthis ploy. Despite his growing antagonism towards the US government, he had not given up on, if\nnot becoming a secret agent, working in the netherworld of secret intelligence.\n\nAlthough Snowden’s career had abruptly ended at the CIA, there still was a backdoor through\nwhich he could re-enter the spy world. It was private corporations that hired civilian technicians\nto work for spy agencies as independent contractors. By 2009, The CIA, NSA and other US\nintelligence services had outsourced much of the job of maintaining and upgrading their computer\nsystems to these private companies. They supplied the NSA with most of its system\nadministrators and other information technology workers. This arrangement allowed the NSA to\neffectively bypass budget limits and other restrictions limiting how many NSA technicians it could\nrecruit. Instead, of putting these workers on its own payroll, they nominally worked for, and\nreceived their paychecks from, private employers. In fact, many of these outside contractors\nworked full-time for the NSA.\n\nSnowden applied in April 2009 to one of these private companies, Dell SecureWorks. It was\na subsidiary of the Dell computer company. To diverse out of manufacturing computers, Dell had\nrecently gone into the business of managing government computer systems for the NSA and other\nintelligence services. As a leading specialist in the field of corporate cyber security, Dell had no\nproblem obtaining sizable contracts for from the NSA’s Technology Directorate. In 2008, the\nNSA had in effect outsourced to Dell the task of re-organizing its back-up systems at its regional\nbases. Now Dell had to find thousands of independent contractors to work at these bases In\n2009, when Snowden applied, Dell was seeking to fill positions at the NSA’s regional base in\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_020207\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

It is not strictly\nconserved, because likelihood is generally not identical to outcome. There is ex ante\nand ex post fitness. But the ex ante kind is meaningless unless potency, in Aristotle’s\nterms, is expected to converge to act. Hamilton’s rule should not have escaped this\n\ncritique for half a century. It clearly has merit, but needs some different expression.\n\nSuch a reformulation might treat rb/c as a maximand within practical constraints.\nWe can see how it might be by looking at the context. Darwin’s idea is a competition\nfor breeding success. This biological imperative is a powerful predictor in nature. It\npredicts that traits are selected for successful reproduction to the exclusion of all\nelse. Evidence is impressive. “Semelparous” creatures who breed only once and do\nnot invest postpartum care, like salmon and soybeans, die within hours. An octopus\nmother breeds only once, cares for her young a few weeks, and dies as they disperse.\nNature is on a tight budget. Resources wasted soon become resources lost to\n\nthriftier lineages.\n\nHamilton saw this. He was right in stressing the role of competition among\nindividuals and individual heritable traits. Darwin did the same. One thing\nHamilton’s rule leaves out, which is not to claim that he overlooked it, is that traits\nand their genes best at prioritizing self-replication might for that reason hurt\nchances of achieving it. We know this happens. Human tradition everywhere resists\n\nand punishes nepotism when it crosses a line.

However, we think that demand is unlikely to drop as quickly as the USDA expects. According to the\nlatest USDA grain stocks and WASDE reports, feed demand remained surprisingly resilient in 3Q12. To\neffectively ration demand, especially on the feed side, in an environment of critically low US corn and\nsoybean stocks, higher prices are still required. For wheat, global production estimates were further\nlowered due to production losses in Australia, EU, Russia for 2012/13, which likely keeps prices supported in\nthe near term.

For\nexample, controversies over the use of\nstimulants to manage childhood behavior\ndisorders, or the medicalization of social\nanxiety, seem to reflect disagreements\nabout more basic questions: What brings\nhuman happiness? Which moods and\nbehaviors should be considered normal\nparts of human experience and which\nshould be considered abnormal? What\nsorts of suffering should we try to\nalleviate? What leads to disordered\nbehaviors? What resources (social,\npsychological, spiritual or otherwise) are\nbest suited to addressing disruptions in\nindividuals’ mental and emotional\nstates? How does modern medicine fit\ninto our response to these experiences?\nAlthough physicians may not ask or\nanswer these questions explicitly, they\nimplicitly answer them in their responses\nand recommendations to patients.\n\nSo, for all that is hoped for in\n‘scientific’ and ‘evidence-based’\npractice, clinicians must in the end act as\npractical moral philosophers, making\njudgments about how best to pursue the\ngoals of medicine for a particular patient\nin a particular context, all things\nconsidered. Among those things to be\nconsidered are moral valuations about\nwhich religions and other moral\n\n143\n\nPage\n\ntraditions have much to say, but about\nwhich medical science remains silent.\n\nCaring for the patient as person\n\nSo far I have suggested that\nreligions provide a vision that animates\ncare of the sick and a moral framework\nthat guides the application of medical\ntechnology. Religions make another\ncontribution by fostering practices that\nnurture the human capacity to care for\npatients as persons rather than as mere\nobjects.\n\nPatients commonly complain that\ntheir physicians treat them as mere\nobjects or specimens rather than\nappreciating and attending to them as\nunique persons. This problem has always\nplagued the profession. To learn how to\nheal, the novice physician must learn of\npatients as representing abstract general\ntypes and classes. She must learn about\ncoronary artery disease and hematuria\nbefore she can begin to interpret Mrs.\nSmith’s chest discomfort and Mr.\nJones’s red urine. These abstractions\nallow knowledge of when and how\nthings happen, and that knowledge\nguides technological interventions that\nmay bring healing to the body. These\nabstractions also help doctors objectify\ntheir patients’ humanity enough to\nviolate social norms that operate in every\nother social situation, such as asking\npatients to expose their nakedness in\nvulnerable positions, or cutting patients\napart in hopes of making them whole.\n\nAs long as the process does not\ngo too far, scientific detachment serves\nto make our concern effective. Yet the\ncollective experience of both patients\nand physicians suggests that such\ndetachment usually does go too far and\noccurs too easily.

Without getting religious about it, it is rationally\nquite possible that some aspects of the universe are beyond the scope of scientific methods.\nScience is fundamentally about recognizing patterns in finite sets of bits (e.g. finite sets of\nfinite-precision observations), whereas mathematics recognizes many sets much larger than this.\nSelmer Bringsjord [BZ03], and other advocates of “hypercomputing” approaches to intelligence,\nargue that the human mind depends on massively large infinite sets and therefore can never be\nsimulated on digital computers nor understood via finite sets of finite-precision measurements\nsuch as science deals with.\n\nBut again, while this sort of possibility is interesting to speculate about, there’s no real reason\nto believe it at this time. Brain science and AI are both very young sciences and the “working\nhypothesis” that digital computers can manifest advanced AGI has hardly been explored at\nall yet, relative to what will be possible in the next decades as computers get more and more\npowerful and our understanding of neuroscience and cognitive science gets more and more\ncomplete. The CogPrime AGI design presented here is based on this working hypothesis.\n\nMany of the ideas in the book are actually independent of the “mind can be implemented\ndigitally” working hypothesis, and could apply to AGI systems built on analog, quantum or\nother non-digital frameworks — but we will not pursue these possibilities here. For the moment,\noutlining an AGI design for digital computers is hard enough! Regardless of speculations about\nquantum computing in the brain, it seems clear that AGI on quantum computers is part of our\nfuture and will be a powerful thing; but the description of a CogPrime analogue for quantum\ncomputers will be left for a later work.\n\n1.7 Five Key Words\n\nAs noted, the CogPrime approach lies squarely in the integrative cognitive architecture camp.\nBut it is not a haphazard or opportunistic combination of algorithms and data structures. At\nbottom it is motivated by the patternist philosophy of mind laid out in Ben Goertzel’s book\nThe Hidden Pattern [Goe06al, which was in large part a summary and reformulation of ideas\npresented in a series of books published earlier by the same author [Goe94], [Goe93a], [Goe93b],\n[Goe97], [Goe01]. A few of the core ideas of this philosophy are laid out in Chapter 3, though\nthat chapter is by no means a thorough summary.\n\nOne way to summarize some of the most important yet commonsensical parts of the patternist\nphilosophy of mind, in an AGI context, is to list five words: perception, memory, prediction,\naction, goals.\n\nIn a phrase: “A mind uses perception and memory to make predictions about\nwhich actions will help it achieve its goals.”\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_012925\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

Working on projects with other Next Gen associates\nhas given me a taste of courses and case study groups at Harvard, and | love it. | have since, through our\nfamily office, been eyeing for investment projects that could make a measurable positive difference on com-\nmunities around the world.\n\nFinally, I'd like to talk about awakening.\n\nAfter decades of managing and growing his company, my father returned to his original passion of sharing\n“wellness” to build sustainable communities. He created the “Wellness Foundation,” a non-profit aiming to\nbring healthy lifestyles to people around the world. One of our international partners is the Clinton Foundation,\nand during our annual Wellness Congress in 2012, former President Clinton even delivered the keynote\nspeech and | am currently helping to bring high profile speakers to our 25th Congress that will be held next\nyear.\n\nFor our local community in Italy, | have been involved in the development of the “Wellness Valley,” a socially\ninnovative project urging all our stakeholders to strengthen civic attitudes and culture towards healthy living\nfor human-centric prevention and sustainability. Our long-term goal is to recreate this model in communities\nworldwide, allowing governments to reduce healthcare costs, companies to increase productivity, and people\nin general to improve their quality of life.\n\nFor several years, this project was, like Technogym, an endeavour outside my job at Luxottica. | joined that\ncompany as a marketing intern and was soon promoted to manage an important licensed brand, Tiffany&Co.\nIt turned out my previous experience had prepared me well for this first big management opportunity, and |\ntruly enjoyed it.\n\nExploring the workings of a complex international firm of 80,000 employees, | began to re-examine my family’s\nbusiness. When Technogym had its IPO in early 2016, | joined its Board of Directors and looked deep into the\ncompany's potential and my own role. The time was right to take on new responsibilities. Resigning from\nLuxottica and training my replacement, | dove into a new Technogym project, the first of its kind. I'm currently\nworking with the Senior Retail VP to develop a B2C sales channel through new experiential stores in Milan\nand London, where | direct staff, strategy, and new revenue streams. Moreover, | recently took responsibility\nover the development of a new business unit with the launch of a clothing line, including the evaluation of\npotential partnerships and acquisitions, aimed at increasing our presence in the consumer sector at a higher\npace. These are uphill endeavours, but | am energetic to face them. My two years on the Board of Enervit —\na listed health-food company, and another family business — have given me useful insights.\n\nLeadership is both a burden and a blessing — having control can also isolate you — that is why | want to get\nall | can from the 360° training and feedback of an HBS MBA. | don't want to be just a founder's daughter; |\nwant to be a leader in my own right. | am a passionate person with vision, intuition and an ability to think\nlaterally — a key asset, | think, for Technogym. Taking charge will be a challenge, but | am sure that with my\ndetermination | will be able to demonstrate the autonomy and leadership to take Technogym into the next era.\nAfter the MBA, | plan to spend several years in the US to push the company’s expansion in the world’s largest\nwellness/fitness market — despite a strong international reputation, our market share in the US is still modest;\n| see the opportunity to grow our presence into a leading position, and earning the best training to prepare for\nthat is my next step.\n\nNow you understand more about me, my family, our company and why my dream has brought me to you. |\nhave worked hard to learn from peers, friends, and mentors and will continue to do so in a new setting that\nwill help me grow — as a woman, a manager, a leader, and, | hope, an example to others.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_029105\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

The idea of showing pain is big in values\ncampaigns. Campaigns against drunk driving like to show students\ndead drivers and awful car crashes. But they miss the real point. Have\nthe students seen their parents drink and drive or friends drink and\ndrive? Are they dead? If not, these campaigns will have little impact\nsince values are subconsciously held.\n\nThere is a way to teach these things but it isn’t easy. Imagine that\nyou wanted to teach teenagers not to drive drunk. You could create a\nsimulation of drunkenness that asked students to drive drunk while\nnot being able to hold their heads steady, blacking out from time to\ntime, and seeing very badly. In other words, instilling a new emotion\ninto the mix can alter values. Make people afraid of something they\nwant to do and that fear will manifest itself when it is time to do it.\nEmotions can be induced into subconscious processes and decision-\nmaking through experience. Emotions can change values.\n\nThere is a sense in which appreciation cannot be taught. You like\nit or you don’t. I have two grandsons. The 5-year-old (my daughter’s\nchild) has announced that he doesn’t want to have anything to do\nwith a ball. The 3-year-old (my son’s child) goes wild with excitement\nwhen he sees ballgames being played and responds excitedly when\nballs are given to him. What is the difference and how did this hap-\npen? The difference is obvious: One appreciates the art of it and one\ndoesn’t. How this happened is less clear, but the parenting is very dif-\nferent with respect to balls in each house. There are other, biologi-\ncal differences as well. The 3-year-old has much taller parents and is\nalready the same size as the 5-year-old. He is much more physical as\nwell.\n\nSo, the question is, Could we teach the 5-year-old to love balls and\nballgames, and could we teach the 3-year-old to hate balls and ball-\ngames? The answer to this is obvious. We could do this. It might be\nhard but people are, unfortunately, quite good at negative reinforce-\nment, so it is possible to make people change their attitudes by using\nit as a method.\n\nIs there a way to teach the positive? Can we get someone to ap-\npreciate a work of art who does not respond immediately to works of\nart? Can we get someone to appreciate classical music who does not\nhave any interest in it?\n\nThis is, of course, what many art history or music appreciation\ncourses endeavor to do.

But I was confident that any apprehension\nwould be overtaken by adrenalin when as the assault began.\n\nAs we got closer, Shai Agmon radioed me. He said two or three people, not\nthe terrorists, had come out of the plane. One seemed to be the Red Cross man.\nThey were about 120 yards away from the aircraft. As soon as he’d signed off, I\ngot word from the command post in the control tower that it was indeed the Red\nCross representative, along with two of the flight crew. They’d been chosen by\nthe terrorists to do security checks on the “maintenance” men.\n\nI brought the convoy to a halt. The Red Cross man gave each of us a fairly\ncursory body search before waving us on. Then, he got to Bibi. Though I had\nsomehow failed to notice, he had left on his red sayeret boots. In Israel, that was\nthe equivalent of a neon sign saying: “I am a paratrooper.” Although the Red\nCross man noticed the boots, he at first made no comment. Then, rolling up the\npants leg of Bibi’s overalls, he saw his Beretta — not inside his waistbelt, but\ninside the boot. The next thing I heard was an angry spurt of French as the man\ncalled the control tower. For a moment, I feared the mission was over, with\npotentially fatal repercussions for the hostages. But whatever explanation the\nRed Cross man was given — presumably by Dayan himself, who would not have\nheld back in conveying what was at stake — it dissuaded him from taking further\naction.\n\nAs we were returning to the buggies, the Red Cross man told me that\n“Captain Rifa’at” had ordered us to pull up to the generator on the side of the\nplane. Each of us would then have to walk forward and open the front of our\noveralls so he could make sure we weren’t armed. I passed back four orders to\nthe rest of the men. First, with no exceptions, move your pistol to the back of\nyour belt. Second: I’Il be the first to go through the inspection.

My passion is the Italian Renaissance and the rich history behind it, especially the works of 15th century masters \nsuch as Masaccio and Bellini. Some of the courses that NYU offers such as \"Early masters of Italian Renaissance painting\" and \n\"Florentine Villas: An Interpretation Based on Historical, Social Factors\" are, therefore appealing to me. What I find exciting, is not \nonly the visual aesthetics and analysis of these masterpieces, but also the manner in which the Renaissance emphasised \nscientific and economic innovation, areas of study the Global Liberal Arts programme would offer. NYU's unique campus in \nFlorence would give me a once in lifetime opportunity to spend a year immersing myself in the art, culture and history of Italy. This \nwould be an exciting experience to have while studying for a Bachelor's degree in Art History, and would compliment my main \ninterests in the subject. \nAs one of the prime cultural centres in the world, NYU's location in NYC is the perfect place to broaden knowledge within \ncontemporary art. I am very much looking forward to visiting the Whitney Biennia this May. In addition the New museum, which \nshows a lot of the kind of work I find interesting is a short walk away from campus. \nTaking advantage of being based in central London for the past year, I have completed the Chairman's Programme at Christies, \nwork experience at the Courtauld Gallery and I will be working at Maddox Gallery in the near future. Similarly, I want to take \nadvantage of being based in NYC to gain as much experience as possible. I have chosen to apply Early Decision to NYU as it is the \nonly American university I will be applying to, as there is no better place to obtain experience of the contemporary art world than \nNew York City. \nEssay 2. \nFrom the age of extremes to the age of bewilderment \nWhat captivates me more than anything else is the different ideological phases of the 20th century and how art can be used as \na tool of advancement and reflection on ideological and political developments. \nMy fascination began when I read; Eric Hobsbawm's \"Age Of Extremes\" and has since developed through books such as \nBenjamin Carter Heft's \"The Death Of Democracy\" and Yuval Harari \"A Brief History Of Tomorrow\" and \"21 Lessons For \nThe 21st Century\". \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 033416 \nIn the years after the First World War, until the end of the Second World War, three political models for shaping the future of \nnation states emerged; Fascism, Communism and liberal democracy. These all offered great ideas for the future of the world. \nFascism and Communism shared some common features: authoritarian, strong leaders and a belief that their revolutions had \nto be carried through with violence. This led to the mass murders in the Nazi concentration camps and in the Soviet Gulags. \nIn the mid war periods, the \"Litfass columns\" that were originally designed to carry advertising, became the outdoor galleries \nfor the war of ideologies. The political poster was born. High quality posters from every political party in Germany popped \nup on the columns. Hitler's propaganda chief G8ebels stated that the Nazi election campaign should be run through speeches \nand posters. The other parties responded in kind. An art form thus became an essential political tool in the battle for votes. \nThe propagandist Art used by the Nazis and communists alike was essential in helping sell their message to the masses. \nIndeed, much of the art that was critical of these movements was suppressed or censored and \"subversive\" artists cowed, in \nsome cases imprisoned or even worse. \nThe liberal democratic model departed sharply from these authoritarian perspectives by presenting the alternative of free and \ntransparent elections, the rule of law and freedom of speech. In the mid-war period the three narratives were competing to be \nthe conceptual frame for society. After the Second World War fascism was crushed leaving the two competing ideologies of \ncommunism and liberal democracy. After the demise of communism in 1989, through to the late 1990's, liberal democracy \nwas victorious in the idealogical battlefield. Some historians, like Francis Fukuyama, went so far as to proclaim this period as \n\"the end of history\". \nA key piece of art that championed this kind of ideology was Sheppard Fairey's campaign poster for Barack Obama. In this \nposter, Fairey, a well established graffiti artist uses urban colours and stencilling techniques combined with the message \n\"HOPE\" to promote the incoming presidents positive values and popularity with the young. It is notable that Fairey's most \nrecent political poster protests the Trump presidency rather than promote it. \nWith the rise of so called \"illiberal democracy\", with strong parties standing for populist ideologies, we have now moved into \nwhat can be described as the age of bewilderment. We were not in fact at the \"end of history\". Once again the future looks \nunpredictable and insecure and artists are responding in different ways. \nJeremy Deller, a British Turner prize winning artist created a work which features a car damaged in the bombing of the \nhistoric Mutanabbi Street book market, which resulted in the deaths of 38 people. Here, an art work has been used to show the \naftermath of an event. This event was the result of the Iraq war, which was seen as a way to spread democracy. Here Art is \nused as a means by which to explore the effects of ideology rather than promote it, another really interesting area in the study \nof the intersections between ideology and art. \nExploring how art reflects the historical and ideological contexts of the world around it is fascinating to me and I would love \nto study these ideas in more depth at undergraduate level. \nplease note \nThe information contained in this communication is \nconfidential, may be attorney-client privileged, may \nconstitute inside information, and is intended only for \nthe use of the addressee.

Given the strengths and weaknesses of current and near-future digital computers,\n\na. A (loosely) neural-symbolic network is a good representation for directly storing many\nkinds of memory, and interfacing between those that it doesn’t store directly;\n\nb. Uncertain logic is a good way to handle declarative knowledge. To deal with the prob-\nlems facing a human-level AGI, an uncertain logic must integrate imprecise probability\nand fuzziness with a broad scope of logical constructs. PLN is one good realization.\n\nc. Programs are a good way to represent procedures (both cognitive and physical-action,\nbut perhaps not including low-level motor-control procedures).\n\nd. Evolutionary program learning is a good way to handle difficult program learning prob-\nlems. Probabilistic learning on normalized programs is one effective approach to evolu-\ntionary program learning. MOSES is one good realization of this approach.\n\ne. Multistart hill-climbing, with a strong Occam prior, is a good way to handle relatively\nstraightforward program learning problems.\n\nf. Activation spreading and Hebbian learning comprise a reasonable way to handle atten-\ntional knowledge (though other approaches, with greater overhead cost, may provide\nbetter accuracy and may be appropriate in some situations).\n\ne Artificial economics is an effective approach to activation spreading and Hebbian\nlearning in the context of neural-symbolic networks;\n\ne ECAN is one good realization of artificial economics;\n\ne A good trade-off between comprehensiveness and efficiency is to focus on two kinds\nof attention: processor attention (represented in CogPrime by ShortTermImpor-\ntance) and memory attention (represented in CogPrime by LongTermImportance).\n\ng. Simulation is a good way to handle episodic knowledge (remembered and imagined).\nRunning an internal world simulation engine is an effective way to handle simulation.\n\nh. Hybridization of one’s integrative neural-symbolic system with a spatiotemporally hier-\narchical deep learning system is an effective way to handle representation and learning\nof low-level sensorimotor knowledge. DeSTIN is one example of a deep learning system\nof this nature that can be effective in this context.\n\ni. One effective way to handle goals is to represent them declaratively, and allocate atten-\ntion among them economically. CogPrime’s PLN/ECAN based framework for handling\nintentional knowledge is one good realization.\n\n11. It is important for an intelligent system to have some way of recognizing large-scale pat-\nterns in itself, and then embodying these patterns as new, localized knowledge items in\nits memory. Given the use of a neural-symbolic network for knowledge representation, a\ngraph-mining based “map formation” heuristic is one good way to do this.\n\n12. Occam’s Razor: Intelligence is closely tied to the creation of procedures that achieve goals\nin environments in the simplest possible way. Each of an AGI system’s cognitive algorithms\nshould embody a simplicity bias in some explicit or implicit form.\n\n13. An AGI system, if supplied with a commonsensically ethical goal system and an intentional\ncomponent based on rigorous uncertain inference, should be able to reliably achieve a much\nhigher level of commonsensically ethical behavior than any human being.\n\n14. Once sufficiently advanced, an AGI system with a logic-based declarative knowledge ap-\nproach and a program-learning-based procedural knowledge approach should be able to\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_012931\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

He is the current president of the\nMidwest Society of General Internal Medicine\nand has received numerous awards, including a\nModels That Work Award from the United\nStates Bureau of Primary Health Care and the\nNew Investigator Health Sciences Research\nAward from the Gerontological Society of\nAmerica. With a medical degree, as well as a\nPhD in social service administration, Dr. Masi’s\nresearch focuses on the socioeconomic factors\nunderlying health disparities. He currently has\ntwo projects, one aimed at developing an\nintervention to reduce loneliness and one focused\non the role of sex hormones in gender, age, and\nracial differences in cardiovascular disease. He\nis a reviewer for several scientific journals and\ngrant-making organizations and has published\nresearch and reviews on diverse topics, including\nhealth insurance reform and racial disparities in\nbreast cancer and hypertension.\n\nHuman capacity for creativity,\ncompassion, and learning is unparalleled in the\nanimal kingdom. However, humans reach their\nfull potential only when they are socially\nengaged. Lack of social engagement impairs\ncreativity and learning, and limits opportunities\nfor caregiving and emotional growth. Numerous\nstudies have shown that loneliness is also a risk\nfactor for illness and premature mortality.\nBecause loneliness is increasing in modern\nsociety, it is critically important to understand\nthis condition, as well as strategies to reduce it.\nThis essay describes our review of the literature\nregarding loneliness reduction interventions.\n\nPage |130\n\nThe 17\" century English\nphilosopher Thomas Hobbes proposed\nthat without the organizing structure of\ngovernment, humans would experience\nbellum omnimum contra omnes (war of\nall against all) and life would be\n“solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and\nshort”(1). While this colorful description\nis often quoted, less attention is paid to\nHobbes’ premise that such misery can be\navoided if humans codify and enforce\nthe rules of a civil society. Not everyone\nagrees with Hobbes’ views, but history\nis replete with examples of human\nmisery when anarchy reigns and of\nrelative peace when a social contract is\nobserved. A question that philosophers\ncontinue to debate is whether\ncollaboration for mutual benefit is part\nof human nature or whether promotion\nof the self above all others is man’s\nprimary motivation. In this volume,\nCacioppo argues that sociality is an\nintegral part of human nature. He notes\nthat given each child’s prolonged period\nof total dependence, survival into child-\nbearing age depends entirely upon the\nsupport and protection of adults, most\noften parents or kin. As a result, those\nwho survive long enough to procreate\npass along genes for nurturing and\nprotection, thereby hardwiring a form of\nsociality into our genetic code.\n\nThis protective behavior helps\nensure that genes within a family are\npassed on to future generations.\nCooperation among unrelated adults or\nthe support and protection of children by\nadults exists beyond kin, as well,\nbecause these activities also provide\nsurvival benefit. Examples from early\nhuman existence include hunting and\ngathering, which are more likely to\nsucceed when pursued as a group than\nindividually. To these structural benefits\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_021376\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

People whose names did not appear in the cohorts for the time periods in question (1925-1933,\n1933-1945, and 1955-1965) were eliminated from the analysis.\n\nThe cohorts we generated were based on four major sources, and their content is given in Appendix.\n1) The Hermann lists\n\nThe lists of the infamous librarian Wolfgang Hermann were originally published in a librarianship journal\nand later in Boersenblatt, a publishing industry magazine in Germany. They are reproduced in Ref $11. A\ndigital version is available on the German-language version of Wikipedia (Ref $12). We considered\ndigitizing Ref $10 by hand to ensure accuracy, but felt that both OCR and manual entry would be time-\nconsuming and error prone. Consequently, we began with the list available on Wikipedia and hired a\nmanual annotator to compare this list with the version appearing in Ref $11 to ensure the accuracy of the\nresulting list. The annotator did not have access to our data and made these decisions purely on the\nbasis of the text of Ref $11. The following changes were made:\n\nLiterature\n1) “Fjodor Panfjorow’ was changed to “Fjodor Panferov”.\n2) “Nelly Sachs” was deleted.\n\nHistory\n1) “Hegemann W. Ellwald, Fr. v.” was changed to “W. Hegemann” and “Fr. Von Hellwald”\n\nArt\n4) “Paul Stefan” was deleted.\n\nPhilosophy/Religion\n1) “Max Nitsche’” was deleted.\n\nThe results of this manual correction process were used as our lists for Politics, Literature, Literary\nHistory, History, Art-related Writers, and Philosophy/Religion.\n\n2) The Berlin list\n\nThe lists of Hermann continued to be expanded by the Nazi regime. We also analyzed a version from\n1938 (Ref $13). This version was digitized by the City of Berlin to mark the 75\" year after the book\nburnings in 2008 (Ref S14). The list of authors appearing on the website occasionally included multiple\nauthors on a single line, or errors in which the author field did not actually contain the name of a person\nwho wrote the text. These were corrected by hand to create an initial list.\n\nWe noted that many authors were listed only using a last name and a first initial. Our manual annotator\nattempted to determine the full name of any such author. The results were far from comprehensive, but\ndid lead us to expand the dataset somewhat; names with only first initials were replaced by the full name\nwherever possible.\n\nSome authors were listed using a pseudonym, and on several occasions our manual annotator was able\nto determine the real name of the author who used a given pseudonym. In this case, the real name was\nadded to the list.\n\nIn addition, we occasionally included multiple spelling variants for a single author. Because of this, and\nbecause an author’s real name and pseudonym may both be included on the list, the number of author\nnames on the list very slightly exceeds the number of individuals being examined. The numbers reported\nin the figure are the number of names on the list.\n\nIt is worth pointing out that Adolf Hitler appears as an author of one of the banned books from 1938. This\nis due to a French version of Mein Kampf, together with commentary, which was banned by the Nazi\nauthorities. Although it is extremely peculiar to find Hitler on a list of banned authors, we did not remove\nHitlers name, as we had no basis for doing so from the standpoint of the technical authorship and name\ncriteria described above: Adolf Hitler is indeed listed as the author of a book that was banned by the Nazi\nregime. This is consistent with our stance throughout the paper, which is that we avoided making\njudgments ourselves that could bias the outcome of our results. Instead, we relied strictly upon our\n\n27\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_017035\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

And the prized Korean manufacturing excellence was no match\nfor cheap Chinese and then Vietnamese labor welded to assembly-line technology.\n\nWe see this pattern of network-led shredding nearly everywhere now, the result of\npowerful cores of knowledge and wide distribution of connection. Newspapers -\nremoved from relevancy by crowd-sourced newsfeeds and constantly-connected\nsmart databases. Once indomintable television networks, devoured by cheap home-\nmade videos and large-scale platforms that use the Internet for distribution. Bitcoin\nand other first-generation block-chained currencies eating at the once\nunquestionable authority of central banks. Drones hovering along ona skein of GPS\nand data links are also among the new citizens of this connected skein. They are\nproducts of a data web: They depend on centralized connection and the distribution\nof technology, data, and design. They may do to old ideas of security and power\nwhat the fusion of GPS and smart phones and databases have done to hotel chains or\nmedicine. Massed, self-organized drone fleets can turn aircraft carriers and exposed\nbattle groups from sources of strength into vulnerable and even dangerously self-\ndefeating antiques. They will remake urban landscapes. Think of the way that Baron\nHausman redesigned Paris in the 18 Century to manage with the Enlightement-age\ndanger of liberated, angry citizens. The creation of the city’s wide boulevards,\ncentral axes for easy movement of the police, and intersections engineered to\nquarantine riots was a reaction against the demands of mass liberty. Our cities are\nnow vulnerable not simply to mass protest risk, but to the pinch of asymmetric\nlevitating drones. The sensations of safety behind walls, up a staircase, inside a\nwindowed room all begin to slip away. Drone risk - and all the potentially\nwonderful elements of constant, instant drone assistance — will command a\nretooling of cities, much as automobiles did a century ago.\n\nSo this is power: Cores and distribution. They way that tension pulls particularly on\ncertain, once-essential structures and objects and people explains a lot about our\nage — including the failure of so many institutions. Connectivity changes the nature\nof an object. That’s true for your doctor, your bank account, your army - and for\nbillions of people whose lives alter irreversibly once they connect to markets, to\nknowledge, to the world. To connect now is to be exposed to this fresh young skin of\nlinked power, a lively surface that transports anything at near instant speed. We\nhave to ask just how many of the “scaffolds humans erect” that were essential for\nEnlightenment-era advances will be pulled down. And of course we face the exciting,\nuneasy task of thinking up the new scaffolds we now must build.\n\nIf you have the tools or the skill to see the world this way, as a vibrating and pulling\nmesh of connections, then you can look ata tanks or soldiers or years of stability\nand see possibility. A friend who controls the largest secure Bitcoin vault in the\nworld, put it to me once this way: “Platforms mattered once; now it is protocols.” His\npoint was that the pipes and rules connecting the varied systems of our world affect,\nfundamentally, the distribution of power. The rules of the Bitcoin blockchain or the\nimplications of a protocol like IPv6 or DNSSSEC reveals something about how we'll\nall connect in the future.

As provided by clause 11(g) of Rule X of the House of \nRepresentatives, the Committee has forwarded this Memorandum to the President based on its \ndetennination that the release of the Memorandum would serve the public interest. \nThe Constitution vests the President with the authority to protect national security secrets from \ndisclosure. As the Supreme Court has recognized, it is the President's responsibility to classify, \ndeclassify, and control access to information bearing on our intelligence sources and methods \nand national defense. See, e.g., Dep 't of Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 527 (1988). In order to \nfacilitate appropriate congressional oversight, the Executive Branch may entrust classified \ninformation to the appropriate committees of Congress, as it has done in connection with the \nCommittee's oversight activities here. The Executive Branch does so on the assumption that the \nCommittee will responsibly protect such classified information, consistent with the laws of the \nUnited States. \nThe Committee has now determined that the release of the Memorandum would be appropriate. \nThe Executive Branch, across Administrations of both parties, has worked to accommodate \ncongressional requests to declassify specific materials in the public interest.1 However, public \nrelease of classified information by unilateral action of the Legislative Branch is extremely rare \nand raises significant separation of powers concerns. Accordingly, the Committee's request to \nrelease the Memorandum is interpreted as a request for declassification pursuant to the \nPresident's authority. \nThe President understands that the protection of our national security represents his highest \nobligation. Accordingly, he has directed lawyers and national security staff to assess the \nSee, e.g., S. Rept. 114-8 at 12 (Administration of Barack Obama) (\"On April 3, 2014. . . the Committee agreed to \nsend the revised Findings and Conclusions, and the updated Executive Summary of the Committee Study, to the \nPresident for declassification and public release.\"); H. Rept. 107-792 (Administration of George W. Bush) (similar); \nE.O. 12812 (Administration of George H.W. Bush) (noting Senate resolution requesting that President provide for \ndeclassification of certain information via Executive Order). \n\fdeclassification request, consistent with established standards governing the handling of \nclassified information, including those under Section 3.1(d) of Executive Order 13526. Those \nstandards permit declassification when the public interest in disclosure outweighs any need to \nprotect the information. The White House review process also included input from the Office of \nthe Director of National Intelligence and the Department of Justice. Consistent with this review \nand these standards, the President has determined that declassification of the Memorandum is \nappropriate. \nBased on this assessment and in light of the significant public interest in the memorandum, the \nPresident has authorized the declassification of the Memorandum. To be clear, the \nMemorandum reflects the judgments of its congressional authors. The President understands \nthat oversight concerning matters related to the Memorandum may be continuing. Though the \ncircumstances leading to the declassification through this process are extraordinary, the \nExecutive Branch stands ready to work with Congress to accommodate oversight requests \nconsistent with applicable standards and processes, including the need to protect intelligence \nsources and methods. \nSincerely, \nDonald F. McGahn II \nCounsel to the President \ncc: The Honorable Paul Ryan \nSpeaker of the House of Representatives \nThe Honorable Adam Schiff \nRanking Member, House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence \n\fUN \".-1 \nTo: \nFrom: \nSubject: Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act Abuses at the Department of Justice and the \nFederal Bureau of Investigation \nASSIHEir\"\"\"\"\"s\" \nDeclassified by order of the President \nFebruary 2, 2018 \nJanuary 18, 2018 \nHPSCI Majority Members \nHPSCI Majority Staff \nPurpose \nThis memorandum provides Members an update on significant facts relating to the \nCommittee's ongoing investigation into the Department of Justice (DOJ) and Federal Bureau of \nInvestigation (FBI) and their use of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) during the \n2016 presidential election cycle. Our findings, which are detailed below, 1) raise concerns with \nthe legitimacy and legality of certain DOJ and FBI interactions with the Foreign Intelligence \nSurveillance Court (FISC), and 2) represent a troubling breakdown of legal processes established \nto protect the American people from abuses related to the FISA process. \nInvestigation Update \nOn October 21, 2016, DOJ and FBI sought and received a FISA probable cause order \n(not under Title VII) authorizing electronic surveillance on Carter Page from the FISC. Page is a \nU.S. citizen who served as a volunteer advisor to the Trump presidential campaign. Consistent \nwith requirements under FISA, the application had to be first certified by the Director or Deputy \nDirector of the FBI. It then required the approval of the Attorney General, Deputy Attorney \nGeneral (DAG), or the Senate-confirmed Assistant Attorney General for the National Security \nDivision. \nThe FBI and DOJ obtained one initial FISA warrant targeting Carter Page and three FISA \nrenewals from the FISC. As required by statute (50 U.S.C. §1805(d)(1)), a FISA order on an \nAmerican citizen must be renewed by the FISC every 90 days and each renewal requires a \nseparate finding of probable cause. Then-Director James Comey signed three FISA applications \nin question on behalf of the FBI, and Deputy Director Andrew McCabe signed one. Then-DAG \nSally Yates, then-Acting DAG Dana Boente, and DAG Rod Rosenstein each signed one or more \nFISA applications on behalf of DOJ. \nDue to the sensitive nature of foreign intelligence activity, FISA submissions (including \nrenewals) before the FISC are classified. As such, the public's confidence in the integrity of the \nFISA process depends on the court's ability to hold the government to the highest standard—\nparticularly as it relates to surveillance of American citizens. However, the FISC' s rigor in \nprotecting the rights of Americans, which is rem orce 5y9 -day renewals of surveillance \norders, is necessarily dependent on the government's production to the court of all material and \nrelevant facts. This should include infoimation potentially favorable to the target of the FISA \nlk.J1 LA-1\\-L,1/I1V,11V71\\1116 \nPROPERTY OF THE U.S. HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES \n\fapplication that is known by the government. In the case of Carter Page, the government had at \nleast four independent opportunities before the FISC to accurately provide an accounting of the \nrelevant facts. However, our findings indicate that, as described below, material and relevant \ninformation was omitted. \n1) The \"dossier\" compiled by Christopher Steele (Steele dossier) on behalf of the \nDemocratic National Committee (DNC) and the Hillary Clinton campaign foimed an \nessential part of the Carter Page FISA application. Steele was a longtime FBI source who \nwas paid over $160,000 by the DNC and Clinton campaign, via the law firm Perkins Coie \nand research firm Fusion GPS, to obtain derogatory infoiniation on Donald Trump's ties \nto Russia. \na) Neither the initial application in October 2016, nor any of the renewals, disclose or \nreference the role of the DNC, Clinton campaign, or any party/campaign in funding \nSteele's efforts, even though the political origins of the Steele dossier were then \nknown to senior DOJ and FBI officials. \nb) The initial FISA application notes Steele was working for a named U.S. person, but \ndoes not name Fusion GPS and principal Glenn Simpson, who was paid by a U.S. law \nfirm (Perkins Coie) representing the DNC (even though it was known by DOJ at the \ntime that political actors were involved with the Steele dossier). The application does \nnot mention Steele was ultimately working on behalf of___and paid by—the DNC and \nClinton campaign, or that the FBI had separately authorized payment to Steele for the \nsame information. \n2) The Carter Page FISA application also cited extensively a September 23, 2016, Yahoo \nNews article by Michael Isikoff, which focuses on Page's July 2016 trip to Moscow. \nThis article does not corroborate the Steele dossier because it is derived from information \nleaked by Steele himself to Yahoo News. The Page FISA application incorrectly assesses \nthat Steele did not directly provide infoimation to Yahoo News. Steele has admitted in \nBritish court filings that he met with Yahoo News—and several other outlets—in \nSeptember 2016 at the direction of Fusion GPS. Perkins Coie was aware of Steele's \ninitial media contacts because they hosted at least one meeting in Washington D.C. in \n2016 with Steele and Fusion GPS where this matter was discussed. \na) Steele was suspended and then tei___ninated as an FBI source for what the FBI defines \nas the most serious of violations—an unauthorized disclosure to the media of his \nrelationship with the FBI in an October 30, 2016, Mother Jones article by David \nCorn. Steele should have been terminated for his previous undisclosed contacts with \nYahoo and other outlets in September—before the Page application was submitted to \nUNCLASSIFIE \n1//1 k_/1.\\_1`4 \nPROPERTY OF THE U.S. HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES \n\fthe FISC in October—but Steele improperly concealed from and lied to the FBI about \nthose contacts. \nb) Steele's numerous encounters with the media violated the cardinal rule of source \nhandling—maintaining confidentiality—and demonstrated that Steele had become a \nless than reliable source for the FBI. \n3) Before and after Steele was terminated as a source, he maintained contact with DOJ via \nthen-Associate Deputy Attorney General Bruce Ohr, a senior DOJ official who worked \nclosely with Deputy Attorneys General Yates and later Rosenstein. Shortly after the \nelection, the FBI began interviewing Ohr, documenting his communications with Steele. \nFor example, in September 2016, Steele admitted to Ohr his feelings against then-\ncandidate Trump when Steele said he \"was desperate that Donald Trump not get \nelected and was passionate about him not being president.\" This clear evidence of \nSteele's bias was recorded by Ohr at the time and subsequently in official FBI files___but \nnot reflected in any of the Page FISA applications. \na) During this same time period, Ohr's wife was employed by Fusion GPS to assist in \nthe cultivation of opposition research on Trump. Ohr later provided the FBI with all \nof his wife's opposition research, paid for by the DNC and Clinton campaign via \nFusion GPS. The Ohrs' relationship with Steele and Fusion GPS was inexplicably \nconcealed from the FISC. \n4) According to the head of the FBI's counterintelligence division, Assistant Director Bill \nPriestap, corroboration of the Steele dossier was in its \"infancy\" at the time of the initial \nPage FISA application. After Steele was terminated, a source validation report conducted \nby an independent unit within FBI assessed Steele's reporting as only minimally \ncorroborated. Yet, in early January 2017, Director Comey briefed President-elect Trump \non a summary of the Steele dossier, even though it was—according to his June 2017 \ntestimony—\"salacious and unverified.\" While the FISA application relied on Steele's \npast record of credible reporting on other unrelated matters, it ignored or concealed his \nanti-Trump financial and ideological motivations. Furthermore, Deputy Director \nMcCabe testified before the Committee in December 2017 that no surveillance warrant \nwould have been sought from the FISC without the Steele dossier information. \nASS', 'II \nIti*Erniffie \nPROPERTY OF THE U.S. HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES \n\f5) The Page FISA application also mentions information regarding fellow Trump campaign \nadvisor George Papadopoulos, but there is no evidence of any cooperation or conspiracy \nbetween Page and Papadopoulos. The Papadopoulos infoimation triggered the opening \nof an FBI counterintelligence investigation in late July 2016 by FBI agent Pete Strzok. \nStrzok was reassigned by the Special Counsel's Office to FBI Human Resources for \nimproper text messages with his mistress, FBI Attorney Lisa Page (no known relation to \nCarter Page), where they both demonstrated a clear bias against Trump and in favor of \nClinton, whom Strzok had also investigated. The Strzok/Lisa Page texts also reflect \nextensive discussions about the investigation, orchestrating leaks to the media, and \ninclude a meeting with Deputy Director McCabe to discuss an \"insurance\" policy against \nPresident Trump's election. \nC S ATI I isTif.i+D \nTV) \\J__.1/11`4 \\-/1 k-J1 \nPROPERTY OF THE U.S. HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES \n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

Peggy \nSiegal takes us behind the scenes where she got herself on camera along with a few of her famous friends. Nice work if you can get \nit. \nIn 1987, right after director Oliver Stone won the Academy Award for \"Platoon,\" he immediately turned to a domestic arena \nand began working on \"Wall Street\" in New York City where his father had been a stockbroker. Although the film was widely seen \nas a scathing critique of the culture of Wall Street, Stone has said that part of the film is a defense of capitalism, his father's vision of \nfinance (as seen through the Hal Holbrook character) and an homage to his father. \nAt the time Oliver was also fascinated with the connection between the psyche of Latino Miami drug dealers from his earlier \n\"Scarface\" script and the American-born 28- to 35-year-old, white collar stockbrokers. Both groups had an animalistic need to obtain \nbig and fast money. They shared an obsession with corruption and greed. \nOliver sent his actors to Bear Stearns for research, including then-newcomer Charlie Sheen, who played Bud Fox, a kid from \nnowhere. When he learns to cold call, and lands one big client, Gordon Gekko, Fox is thrust into the fast lane with a rock star \nfinancial mentor who teaches him corruption. \nOliver needed an old-fashioned villain to create drama, and he cast Michael Douglas as Gekko against type. Michael was not \nknown as a heavy at the time, but as a charming, handsome, sensitive leading man. Oliver also saw the anger, confidence, \nsalesmanship and style that Michael brought to the role. Michael's Gekko looked a bit like Laker's coach Pat Riley with his slicked \nback hair and well-cut suits, and it became Michael's most important role, winning him the Academy Award for the villain no one \ncould ever forget. \nWhen Gekko delivers his speech, \"Greed, for lack of a better word, is good. Greed is right. Greed works,\" cinematic history was \nmade. \n\"Wall Street\" was set in 1985, a time before ten financial news networks broadcasting 24/7 existed. The entire financial services \nindustry was largely unknown and Oliver Stone nailed it. \nFour years ago, Wall Street's producer Ed Pressman decided it was time for a sequel and met with Fox Film Entertainment co-\nchairmen Tom Rothman and Jim Gianopulos. Michael Douglas was immediately on-board pending script approval. Steven Schiff \nwrote the first script before the global economic crash of 2008 rendered it obsolete. \nAlan Loeb was brought in for a rewrite. Pressman asked me to meet Loeb at the Carlyle Hotel to explain the social rhythms of \nNew York's financial high society. Whereas Gekko 's character was modeled after '70s junk bond kings (Michael Milken) and '80s \nmergers and acquisitions killers (Henry Kravis), Loeb bases the new villain on hedge fund billionaires like John Paulson and Mike \nNovogratz, geniuses who have created stratospheric wealth beyond Gordon Gekko 's wildest dreams. When Oliver Stone agreed to \ndirect, he rewrote a portion of the script to focus on bankers as well as hedge funders, taking no screen credit. \nThis past September, Oliver yelled, \"action\" as Gordon Gekko, with long grey hair, comes back to life as he emerges from a \nlengthy prison stint shot outside of Sing Sing in Ossining, New York. Gekko is desperate to redefine himself in a different era. The \nNew York Post runs a full-page photo of Gekko and New Yorkers immediately become obsessed with the filming of Wall Street 2. \nA week into shooting, a glorious fall day. Ed Pressman invites me on the set at the Central Park Zoo. Oliver designs an elaborate \ntracking shot around the seal pool where Gekko, fresh from jail, walks and talks to Jake Moore, a young idealistic investment banker \nplayed by Shia LaBoeuf. They discuss Gekko's daughter Winnie, Moore's fiancee, played by Carrie Mulligan, who is also having an \noff-screen romance with LaBoeuf. Oliver played Cupid. Moore invites Gekko to the Alzheimer's Ball at the Metropolitan Museum \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 021242 \nof Art. Gekko, who used to be a sponsor or honoree of such events, cannot even afford a ticket. \nThe shot starts with a barking seal jumping for fish, then pans down to the actors. Extras weave in and out. In one take Michael \nmakes a wrong turn and ends up at the monkey house. Everyone laughs. The atmosphere on the set is courteous but quick and tense. \nThere is pressure when you are making a sequel to a hit. \nI watch the action on monitors while sitting on the producers canvas chairs with Pressman, Eric Kopeloff (\"Monsters Ball\") and \nCelia Costas, who was a location manager on the first \"Wall Street.\" They have asked me to be an extra in the Alzheimer's Ball scene \nand bring some friends to play rich Upper East Side socialites. Oliver wants over the top glam, go-to-the-vault jewels and couture \ngowns. \"Give me the night before the Titanic goes down,\" were his exact words. Not a problem. \nI pay a quick visit to Michael in his trailer on Fifth Avenue where he is resting. We go way back. I was his personal publicist \nwhen he won the Golden Globe and Oscar for Best Actor for \"Wall Street\" and we have remained great friends. Gekko is just as \nchallenging for him the second time because of endless pages of technical financial dialogue. We discuss Catherine Zeta-Jones' \nBroadway debut in a \"Little Night Music.\" Michael has a stack of partially finished handwritten thank you notes next to him for gifts \nreceived for their shared birthday party on September 25th at the St. Regis. Her 40th and his 65th. \nI tell him I have been cast as an extra in two scenes and he laughs knowing I am desperate to hang around him and the \nproduction. \n8:30 a.m. on Wednesday, October 21st, another warm, stunning fall day. I report to the wardrobe trailer on 65th Street and \nMadison Avenue. I carry four elaborate cocktail dresses and bags of matching accessories. My hair is in rollers. Statuesque Julia \nKoch walks over from her Park Avenue apartment carrying her white Valentino and long diamond earrings. Her real-life financial \ntitan husband David is unaware where she is this morning. \nVanity Fair's keeper of the Best Dressed List, Amy Fine Collins, arrives totally organized in turquoise vintage Geoffrey Beene, \nand Vogue's fashion editor Hamish Bowles wears a riot of plaids, patterns and a large yellow fake flower on his lapel. Costume \nDesigner Ellen Mirojnick, who created Gordon Gekko's rich slick look in the first film, is ecstatic with the extras I invited. \nOliver is shooting a scene with Josh Brolin (the star of Stone's \"W\"). His character Bretton (never Bret) James, a ruthless Wall \nStreet kingpin, and his perfect wife Samantha (Noelle Beck) are hosting a benefit piano recital for a 13-year-old child prodigy in their \nhuge, art-filled townhouse at 41 East 65th Street. The building actually belongs to Baby Jane Holzer, a wealthy art collector still \nfamous for hanging with Andy Warhol in the '60s. The production designer had Jane's fabulous Warhols moved to storage and \nreplaced with matching photographic copies. Very expensive contemporary art is again an important production element of Oliver's \nvision. \nAt 10:30 a.m., all the extras are placed around the living room set. Oliver's French mother, Jacqueline Stone, and her friend \nMonique Van Vooren, both in their 80s, are seated in front of the fireplace chatting in French. Production assistants fuss over them. \nDebonair macho man Chuck Pfieffer, who appeared in the original film, and I immediately invent a back story—I am his corporate \nwife—and we position ourselves on a couch next to the director's mother. Julia gets the best spot close to the piano and Amy, \nHamish and decorator Geoffrey Bradfield are right behind her. Josh is brought in and the kibitzing stops. \nOliver appears on the set with eagle eyes and a sly grin and quickly re-positions everyone. He explains the scene, gives out lines \nto his favored extras, and on his way out to the monitors in the next room mentions that my earrings are too small. Wardrobe \njumps. Josh rehearses and Oliver finally yells, \"Action.\" The kid plays the piano, Josh explains why we are in his home, asks for \nmoney, the camera dollies as extras say their lines and Shia appears at the door uninvited for a confrontation with Josh. Three hours \nlater a PA yells, \"Lunch\". \nIn costume, Amy, Hamish and I run to The Monkey Bar. I am late to meet \"The Harpies,\" including Liz Smith, Barbara \nWalters, Cynthia McFadden, Nora Ephron, Jennifer Isham, Maury Perl and Beth Kseniak. \nGraydon Carter is at the next table. I tell him Oliver Stone wants him in \"Wall Street 2\" as an extra. (I make this up.) Graydon \njokes that he only works with lines. I say, \"Not a problem.\" (This will be news to Oliver.) \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 021243 \nBack on the set I tell Oliver that Graydon is willing to be in the film with lines. Oliver finds that intriguing. \nOliver shoots the piano recital scene over and over again from different angles all afternoon. Financial wizard Don Marron \nsaunters on the set to visit and Oliver spontaneously puts him in a scene chatting with Josh. Carrie Mulligan hangs out watching \nboyfriend Shia work. \nAt sundown Julia Koch has to race from reel to real life and explain to her husband where she has been all day. (He loves it.) \nChuck Pfieffer plants a \"Page Six\" item and the next day socialites begin calling me to get into the film. \nThursday, November 5, Shun Lee Restaurant, West 65th Street \nOliver shoots a crowded tight interior scene with Michael, Carrie and Shia, who are having an intimate Chinese dinner. \nSpontaneously, Oliver decides this is the perfect scene for Graydon Carter. After a flurry of calls, Graydon arrives on set, and playing \nhimself, sashays by the table. Gekko jumps up to say hello and Graydon brushes him off with a few dismissive lines. \nMonday, November 9, 25 Broadway \nOne hundred swells show up at the former Canard Shipping building, a massive Italianate hall, at the crack of dawn for the \nAlzheimer's Ball, a grand charity event. \nSusan Hess and I are chauffeured downtown with our Vera Wang gowns and report to the VIP extra holding area where we join \nPrince Dimitri of Yugoslavia in a bespoke dinner jacket, journalist Christopher Mason, songstress Yanna Avis, photographer Kelly \nKlein, art dealer Larry Gagosian's girl friend Shala Monroque in see-through Rodarte, beauty executive Olivia Chantecaille, producer \nLawrence Robins, author Jackie Weld Drake, Vogue film critic Joan Juliet Buck, fashion consultant Jill Fairchild, CNN's Felicia \nTaylor and Italian newsman Mario Calvo-Platero. \nEllen Mirojnick and her costume department have assembled racks of the most expensive elaborate designer gowns and work at \nbreak neck speed styling while we wildly strip to our undies in a makeshift dressing area. Ellen pours me into a black tulle Marchesa \nwith a enormous wired silver bow. Twenty hairdressers and make-up artists systematically work on 250 extras. A mile of tables are \nalternately filled with steaming coffee, fattening breakfast foods, hair sprays, mirrors, shoes and jewelry. It's a madhouse of \nexcitement. \nWe are led to the part of the set used for the cocktail reception and placed around Michael Douglas and Charlie Sheen stand-ins. \nCharlie has been flown in from LA for half a days work to reprise his original character. He is now the highest paid television actor \ncommanding two million dollars an episode of \"Two and a Half Men.\" \nOliver arrives on the set greeting, examining, tweaking the shot and always pulling the prettiest girls closest to the \ncamera. Michael and Charlie arrive from their trailers and run their lines as socials drift into their sight lines challenging their \nconcentration on pages of dialogue. Oliver yells, \"Action\" as the extras aggressively jockey for face time. Charlie is not having an \neasy day and they do take after take. My corporate husband Chuck Pfieffer has gotten his real girlfriend Lisa Crosby in the film and \nmy marriage has become a threesome. \nSensing our concern of not making it onto the silver screen Oliver tells his first assistant director to seat a dinner table with \nSusan Hess, Jill Fairchild, Prince Dimitri, Chuck Pfieffer, Grace Meigher and Mario Calvo-Platero. He directs us to chat with each \nother turning left and right as the camera closely pans past our faces. \nElsewhere on the set are John Buffalo Mailer, as Shia's character's best friend, Austin Pendleton, 94-year-old Eli Wallach and \nNatalie Morales. Also in this film are: the magnificent Frank Langella, as Shia's boss, who throws himself in front of a train early in \nthe film, Susan Sarandon as Shia's real-estate broker mother, Sylvia Miles, who reprises her hilarious cameo as another real-estate \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 021244 \nagent and Jean Pigozzi as an international banker. \nLunch is called at 4 p.m. and Michael Douglas takes seven heavily made-up and bejeweled women including Susan, Jill and me \nto a restaurant around the corner. Gordon Gekko hosts a hen party talking about children, schools, country houses and vacations. \nBack on the set Oliver is shooting the actual dinner. Assistant directors ask for volunteers to dance to the live music. Prince \nDimitri twirls and dips Jackie Weld. Kelly Klein, in her own Karl Lagerfeld sheer black organza, watches from a table with scattered \nchampagne glasses half-filled with apple juice along with her 86-year-old father, Tulley Rector. Charlie Sheen leaves for LA and \nShia is very annoyed he was not introduced to his hero. Carrie Mulligan, costumed like Audrey Hepburn, chats with us between \ntakes. \nThe final set up is a long tracking shot of Josh Brolin and his wife as they triumphantly enter the ball. It is close to 9 p.m. and \nLord William Astor arrives to pick me up for Amalia Dayan and Adam Lindemann's dinner for artists uptown. \nOliver is introduced to William and delights in calling him Lord as he immediately moves him into the top of the shot and \ninstructs him to tell Eli Wallach, \"We must do lunch\". Ever the proper English gentleman, William advises Oliver that Lords do not \nuse American slang and improvises his own lines. The tracking shot continues for numerous takes following Josh and Noelle as \nevery VIP extra gets another shot at instant stardom with one-line greetings. \nAt last, \"It's a wrap\" is screamed after 10 p.m. Prince Dimitri tells The Wall Street Journal it was, \"a day of electrifying \nglamour,\" and \"the longest gala of my life. I was in black tie for thirteen hours.\" \nNovember 25, Tommy Gun Salon, Ludlow Street, last day of shooting \nDonald Trump is on set at 7 a.m. ready for his close up. He is trying to make a mid-day departure on his jet from Teterboro \nwith wife Melania and son Baron for Thanksgiving weekend in Palm Beach. Back in September, Oliver had invited Donald Trump to \ndinner at \"21\" to meet his leading men Josh and Shia so they could observe New York's most charismatic powerbroker in his natural \nenvironment. \nThe scene is London so the grey skies are perfect. Gekko has moved abroad to make his financial comeback. The scene opens \non the back of his head in a barber's chair as he watches the financial news on TV. The camera pulls back and Gordon Gekko is \nfinally revealed as the powerful bull he once was in an exquisite suit and signature slicked-back hair. Donald Trump walks into the \nshop for a cut and the banter begins about the money market. From his chair, Donald leans into Michael and suggests a \"comb over\" \nlike his famous do. Gekko, with a slight grin, says, \"No thanks Donald, I am a gel man.\" \nThe crew is yucking it up and Donald feels great. Paparazzi shoot the whole scene with long lenses from across the street. The \nunit publicist is helpless to keep this under wraps. Donald emerges, poses and gives interviews. Michael comes out, and the press \nthink they have a scoop on the ending. Gekko is back in all his lovable titan splendor. Full-page photos of Michael and Donald run \nthe next day in the tabloids. Never underestimate Oliver Stone's surprise endings. \nTwentieth Century Fox releases \"Wall Street 2: The Money Never Sleeps\" on April 23rd and its got hit written all over it. \n*********************************************************** \nThe information contained in this communication is \nconfidential, may be attorney-client privileged, may \nconstitute inside information, and is intended only for \nthe use of the addressee.

(Uma Sanghvi/The Palm Beach Post)\n\nUpdated: 3:43 p.m. Friday, May 12, 2017 |  Posted: 2:45 p.m. Friday, May 12, 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nPALM BEACH —\nPresident Donald Trump is a shadowy, but ever-present, figure in the never-ending saga of billionaire sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.\n\nMar-a-Lago, the commander-in-chief’s private-club-turned-southern-White-House in Palm Beach, was the backdrop for Epstein’s introduction to one of his dozens of teenage victims, according to court records.\n\nIn a short-lived lawsuit that Trump decried as “categorically false,” a California woman last year sued Trump and Epstein in federal court in New York City, claiming the two business tycoons raped her when she was 13 years old.\n\nAnd Trump is on a star-studded witness list for an upcoming trial in Palm Beach County Circuit Court that attorney Jack Scarola promises will be the first public airing of Epstein’s lurid lifestyle.\n\nBut, Scarola acknowledges, it is unlikely the president will be part of what Scarola promises will be a salacious trial. Scarola claims Epstein sued attorney Brad Edwards in an effort to intimidate and punish the lawyer for representing some of Epstein’s victims. While Epstein dropped his lawsuit against Edwards, who has also represented clients in a lawsuit against Trump, the malicious prosecution suit against Epstein will likely go to trial in the fall, Scarola said.\n\nWhen Scarola put Trump on the witness list in August, he said he never imagined the business scion and former television star would soon occupy the Oval Office. The legal battle he would have to launch to get a sitting president to testify simply isn’t worth it, Scarola said.\n\nMoreover, while there is a lot of smoke around Trump’s relationship with Epstein, there appears to be little fire, so far, Scarola said.\n\n“Based on all available public records, Trump’s involvement is peripheral,” he said.\n\n»RELATED: The Post’s complete President Trump coverage\n\nWhile Trump has recently distanced himself from Epstein, a 64-year-old financier, it wasn’t always that way.\n\n“I’ve known Jeff for fifteen years. Terrific guy,” Trump said of Epstein during a 2002 interview with New York magazine. “He’s a lot of fun to be with. It is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do, and many of them are on the younger side.”\n\nAttorney Spencer Kuvin, one of dozens of lawyers who successfully sued Epstein on behalf of roughly 30 women who claimed he lured them to his Palm Beach mansion for sexually-charged massages when they were as young as 14, said he always found the comment curious.\n\n“How would he know that?” he said of Trump’s acknowledgement of Epstein’s penchant for young women. The interview came nearly six years before Epstein’s secret sex life exploded into public view when the money manager pleaded guilty to Florida charges of procuring and soliciting a minor for prostitution. “Why would he make a joke like that?” the West Palm Beach attorney asked.\n\nFurther, Kuvin and others say they can’t believe it is purely coincidental that former South Florida U.S. Attorney Alex Acosta, who signed off on a non-prosecution agreement that kept Epstein from spending years behind bars, was tapped by Trump to be U.S. Labor Secretary.\n\nDuring his confirmation hearings in March, Acosta said it was “awful” that convicted sex offender Epstein was allowed to leave the Palm Beach County Jail to work during his 13-month jail sentence. But he insisted that without the involvement of his office, Epstein would have received far less punishment and his victims wouldn’t have recovered any money from him. As a result of the conviction, Epstein also is on Florida’s registered sex offender list.\n\nScarola, who has represented several of Epstein’s victims in civil lawsuits, scoffed at Acosta’s claims. The evidence that Epstein sexually abused young girls was “overwhelming,” he said.\n\nThe answer to the many questions that still swirl around Epstein and his high-placed friends are the subject of roughly a half-dozen lawsuits that are still pending in both Palm Beach County and New York. Some of the nation’s top attorneys have represented Epstein and some of his victims.\n\nBut like many of the past lawsuits spawned by Epstein’s behavior, most of the remaining ones are expected to be settled. And even public court records don’t tell the full story — because many documents have been sealed or are heavily redacted.\n\nFor example, a defamation lawsuit against one of Epstein’s close friends was scheduled to go to trial in U.S. District Court in New York this coming Monday. But both sides agreed to a delay last week, often a signal that a settlement could be in the works.\n\nThe suit was filed by Virginia Roberts Giuffre against British-born socialite and longtime Epstein friend Ghislaine Maxwell. In a 2009 lawsuit that Epstein settled for an undisclosed amount, Giuffre claimed she was 15 when Maxwell recruited her from her $9-an-hour job in the locker room at Mar-a-Lago, where her father had a job as a maintenance worker. Giuffre claims in court records that Maxwell introduced her to Epstein and that Epstein turned her into his international sex slave.\n\nMaxwell wasn’t sued as part of the lawsuit Giuffre filed against Epstein. But, in court papers filed by Giuffre, Maxwell was accused of grooming Giuffre to be Epstein’s sexual toy.\n\nMaxwell ignored the allegations until Giuffre raised them again in December 2014 and Maxwell began publicly disputing Giuffe’s claims. Famed attorney David Boies then filed a defamation lawsuit on Giuffre’s behalf, claiming Maxwell “undertook a concerted and malicious campaign to discredit Giuffre.” In media interviews, Maxwell called Giuffre’s claims “obvious lies,” Boies wrote.\n\nThe trial promised to provide scurrilous details about Giuffre’s widely publicized contention in court records that Epstein not only used her but loaned her to his rich and powerful friends, including such notables as Prince Andrew and former President Bill Clinton. Similar claims against nationally-known attorney Alan Dershowitz, who represents Epstein, were withdrawn when the Harvard law professor and Giuffre’s attorneys reached a confidential settlement in dueling defamation lawsuits they filed against each other over the allegations.\n\nFlight logs from Epstein’s private jet show Clinton was a frequent flyer, taking Secret Service agents along with him on trips with Epstein around the globe. Clinton has publicly ignored Giuffre’s allegations but an independent investigation launched by Dershowitz raised questions about their veracity.\n\nOne of Epstein’s longtime servants testified that Prince Andrew was a regular guest at Epstein’s house and received massages during the visits. But house manager Juan Alessi acknowledged in a sworn deposition that older women and men offered Swedish massages to Epstein’s guest. It is unclear who gave the British prince the massages or what was included. The prince has vehemently denied Giuffre’s allegations.\n\nAlessi also testified that Trump visited Epstein’s home when both were in Palm Beach. “He would come, have dinner. He never sat at the table,” said Alessi, who described himself as Epstein’s majordomo. “He eat with me in the kitchen.”\n\nBut, Alessi said, unlike other visitors, Trump didn’t avail himself of massages. “No,” he said. “Because he’s got his own spa.”\n\nWhile Giuffre’s defamation lawsuit appears headed for what will likely be a confidential settlement, Scarola said his case against Epstein is going to trial even though Trump won’t be called as a witness.\n\n“We can prove our case without Donald Trump’s testimony,” he said of malicious prosecution lawsuit he filed against Epstein for suing Edwards, the attorney who has represented Giuffre and several of Epstein’s other victims.\n\nEdwards has also been leading a separate charge to prove Acosta’s office violated the federal Crime Victims’ Rights Act when it signed off on the non-prosecution agreement without notifying the women. That suit, which has stalled in federal court after many of the documents were sealed, could eventually reveal why Epstein got what many call a “sweetheart deal,” Scarola said.\n\nEdwards also represented 65 members of Trump National Golf Club Jupiter, who won $5.8 million in February when a federal judge ruled that Trump improperly kept their deposits when he took over the club on Donald Ross Road in Jupiter in 2012. Trump is appealing the decision.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

After receiving objections, the probation officer may meet with the parties and the victim to discuss\nthe objections. The probation officer may then investigate further and revise the presentence report as appropriate.\n\n(h) Notice of Possible Departure from Sentencing Guidelines. Before the court may depart from the applicable sentencing\nrange on a ground not identified for departure either in the presentence report or in a party's prehearing submission or in a\nvictim impact statement, the court must give the parties reasonable notice that it is contemplating such a departure. The notice\nmust specify any ground on which the court is contemplating a departure.

At sentencing, the court:\n\n(A) must verify that the defendant and the defendant's attorney have read and discussed the presentence report and any\naddendum to the report;\n\n(B) must give to the defendant and an attorney for the government a written summary of - or summarize in camera - any\ninformation excluded from the presentence report under Rule 32(d)(3) on which the court will rely in sentencing, and give them\na reasonable opportunity to comment on that information;\n\n(C) must allow the parties' attorneys and any victims to comment on the probation officer's determinations and other matters\nrelating to an appropriate sentence; and\n\n(D) may, for good cause, allow a party or any victim to make a new objection at any time before sentence is imposed.\n\n(2) Introducing Evidence; Producing a Statement. The court may permit the parties or the victim to introduce evidence on the\nobjections. If a witness testifies at sentencing, Rule 26.2(a)-(d) and (f) applies. If a party fails to comply with a Rule 26.2 order\nto produce a witness's statement, the court must not consider that witness's testimony.\n\n(3) Court Determinations. At sentencing, the court:\n(A) may accept any undisputed portion of the presentence report as a finding of fact;\n\n(B) must - for any disputed portion of the presentence report or other controverted matter - rule on the dispute or determine that\na ruling is unnecessary either because the matter will not affect sentencing, or because the court will not consider the matter in\nsentencing; and\n\n(C) must append a copy of the court's determinations under this rule to any copy of the presentence report made available to the\nBureau of Prisons.\n\nThe Rationale:\n\nFor the reasons explained in the preceding section, the victim's right to be \"reasonably heard\" at a sentencing hearing\nencompasses the right to be heard on Sentencing Guidelines issues.

Scarleteen is an amazing sex\neducation site run by the equally amazing sex educator Heather Corinna, and it can\nalways use donations! You should totally go investigate that site -- after you're done\nreading my work, of course.\n\nWhen I first published this piece, the sex-positive film director Tony Comstock\ncommented on Twitter, \"I think that post of yours might be one of the most important\nthings written about sex-positivity in the last 10 years.\" I was really honored by that,\nbecause he does excellent work.\n\nMy parents occasionally read my blog, and I also got some interesting feedback from my\nmother. She wrote to me: \" Speaking from where I sat when you were growing up: I wish\nI could have taught you what you eventually learned on your own. But I felt there was\nthis unchallengeable wave moving and I didn't have a place to stand to counter it. I kept\nthinking I was leaving you to learn the hard way exactly what I learned the hard way,\nand was still learning, and was despairing of ever learning.\"\n\nI wrote back: \"For what it's worth, I remember you trying to stem the tide with small\ncomments, and I think that those comments later helped me center myself in a place\nwhere I could reach my own conclusions rather than blindly sleeping around.\" I hope it\nmade her feel better, because it's true. I'm not a parent, although someday I would like to\nbe... but I think one of the hardest things about parenting must be knowing that your kids\nwill learn terrible things from the surrounding world, and the best you can do is try to be\nthere while they process those lessons.\n\nKOK ok\n\nLiberal, Sex-Positive Sex Education: What's Missing\n\nI am fortunate. I was born in the eighties and I received a great sex-positive upbringing.\nThe public school I attended taught students how to use condoms; middle school health\neducation included a section on sexually transmitted diseases. My parents didn't throw\ntheir sexuality in my face -- but they were almost always matter-of-fact, understanding\nand accepting when they talked about sex. (I'll never forget how, at age 12 or so, Mom\nsat me down and gave me a long speech about how it would be totally okay if I were\ngay.) I was raised Unitarian Universalist, and the Unitarian Sunday School teen program\nincluded a wonderful sex education curriculum called About Your Sexuality. (I\nunderstand that the sex-ed curriculum has been changed and updated, and is now called\nOur Whole Lives.

Needless\nto say, | treat people | interact with with respect, and | work hard to support and mentor students, colleagues, and members of the\ngeneral public. | do not sexually harass people. If the purpose of your reporting is to somehow argue that that Universities and other\ninstitutions are lax in dealing with well known individuals like myself, then in fact the situation is quite the opposite. My high public\nprofile opens me up to more scrutiny at these institutions, not less, and it also opens me up to a host of outside complaints and\nallegations that other faculty do not receive, each of which the University has to respond to. The fact that | have remained a professor\nin all Universities with which | have been associated, in good standing, and also an officer or an invited speaker at organizations like\nCFI, which have strict harassment policies, is a confirmation of the fact that they trust my behavior. | was asked to be an honorary\ndirector of CFI, and invited to their last 3 meetings to speak, specifically because, as they have written me after the fact, the attendees\nuniversally appreciated my talks, my courtesy, and graciousness in spending time with the attendees. If the purpose of your report is to\nimpugn my integrity or suggest | have a history of harassment, that too is false. As noted in one of your 'miscellaneous facts’, as a\nscientist | try and remain skeptical, and rely on empirical evidence, rather than allegations and innuendo. | also try and judge the facts\nin context. The fact that Universities and other organizations employ me or have me on their boards, or invite me to meetings is\nbecause they value my contributions and my actions.\n\nYour specific allegations are false or distorted. Item 1 refers to a consensual encounter in my hotel room in 2006 where we mutually\ndecided, in a polite discussion in fact, that taking it any further would not be appropriate, and had respectful encounters afterwards. |\ncannot comment on item 3, which involves an anonymous 3rd party claim, because | know nothing about it, and it was not taken\nseriously enough to result in any university action. Item 4 is confusing. Are you saying that because | decided | didn’t want to go out to\na bar with a group of attendees that | was harassing them? The second part is false. | don’t do that. Re incident 5: The ‘female\ncompanion’ in this case is my wife, who can attest to the fact that the claim is false, which is what | wrote in response to the blog in\nquestion, causing it to be taken down.\n\nIt is worthwhile responding to Item 2 and 6 in more detail,\n\nRe item 2: the student in question was interested in science communication, and on dozens of occasions came to me or wrote to me\nwith questions. When she asked about advice for after graduation | DID tell her she was different than the other students in her\n\nyear. The rest of them were interested in going on to graduate school, but she was interested in science communication so | told her\nthat she might want to take a different path. Since she was the only woman in her year, as | recall, | did ask her on one of these\noccasions if that made it difficult for her in any way. | asked, because as a faculty member | was interested, and also because as\nsomeone she had asked for career advice from | wanted to know if that made a difference to her. Re asking her for dinner.. | have\ngone back over emails from that period. | have numerous requests from her to go for coffee to talk, which | usually had to turn down\nbecause | was busy, including several occasions where she asked me to have coffee with her off campus to talk, and | politely\ndeclined. | did let her accompany me off campus one time to watch me do a BBC interview because she specifically requested it. | did\nand do have coffee and meals with students on campus, and | see nothing wrong with this. | was shocked when | later learned of her\ncomplaint, not least because there was no inappropriate interaction and also because well after the date on which she is said to have\nbeen offended, she continued to email me with joking questions or comments, and at a AAAS conference in 2008, for which she had\nasked, and for which | had written her a letter of recommendation to attend, my wife and | gave her a lift well out out of our way to drop\nher off at her hotel, and | note in an email response to her email about the conference, agin in 2008, | expressed that | would pass her\nregards along to my wife and vice versa. When the University informed me of the complaint | was shocked and concerned. When |\nspoke to the human resources person, including relating my concerns and providing the emails in question, | was told that no formal\ncomplaint of sexual harassment was deemed to be warranted in this case, and that the young woman in question had agreed to\n\nthat. By that time | learned of the complaint | had already announced my intentions to leave Case to accept an offer at ASU—a very\ndifficult decision for me because of my long-standing attachment to the University, and the excellent relations | had with my colleagues\nthere, both among the faculty and among the administration.

Rev. 835, *890\n\nalternative way is via the probation officer. If there is any doubt about whether the right \"to be heard\" covers communications\nto the probation officer, the right \"to be treated with fairness\" comfortably covers such a requirement.\n\nThe proposed rule requires that the probation office affirmatively seek out the victim. It is unlikely that a probation officer\ncould properly prepare a thorough presentence report without obtaining the victim's views. Indeed, the rules already require the\nofficer to include victim information in the report. 773 Because there is no way [*891] to know in advance whether the victim\nwill have relevant information for the report, the probation officer should be required to investigate that possibility. Of course,\nnothing in the proposed rule change would require the probation officer to include irrelevant or argumentative information in\nthe report.\n\nRule 32(d)(2)(B) - Presentence Report To Contain Victim Information\nThe Proposal:\n\nRule 32(d)(2)(B) should be amended to refer directly to victims in describing the content of the presentence report and to\nconform to the style used for information about defendants as follows:\n\n(2) Additional Information. The presentence report must also contain the following information:\n\n(A) the defendant's history and characteristics, including:\n\n(i) any prior criminal record;\n\n(ii) the defendant's financial condition; and\n\n(iii) any circumstances affecting the defendant's behavior that may be helpful in imposing sentence or in correctional treatment;\n\n(B) verified information, stated in a nonargumentative style, that assesses the financial, social, psychological, and medical\nimpact on any individual against whom the offense has been committed any victim of the crime ...\n\nThe Rationale:\n\nAs discussed at the outset of this article, 734 Rule 32(d)(2)(B) typifies the victim's absence from the current federal rules by\nfailing to use the word \"victim\" in describing what information belongs in a presentence report. In addition, the rule should be\namended to conform to the style used in describing the presentence report's information about the defendant. The rule dealing\nwith the [*892] defendant's background 7° contains no requirement that information be \"verified\" or stated in a \"non-\nargumentative style.\" As a matter of even-handedness, no such requirement should be listed for victim information. Of course,\nwell-trained federal probation officers will no doubt attempt to verify all information in the presentence report and phrase all of\nthe report in a non-argumentative style. The peculiarity in the current rule is that, among the numerous subjects covered by the\nrules, the verification and non-argumentative style requirements apply to victim information alone.\n\nRule 32(e) - Prosecutor To Disclose Presentence Report to Victim\nThe Proposal:\nThe prosecutor should be required to disclose relevant parts of the presentence report to victims as follows:\n\n(ec) Disclosing the Report and Recommendation.\n\n233 See supra notes 10-13 and accompanying text (discussing Rule 32(d)(2)(B)).\n\n234 See supra notes 10-13 and accompanying text.\n\n235, Fed.

A good example of this\nis couples who choose a \"24/7 dynamic\": one partner is dominant and the other is\nsubmissive... all the time. I attended a workshop once with Sir Top and slave bonnie, two\nwise BDSM educators, where I learned that slave bonnie was only ever allowed to\ndisobey orders of two kinds:\n\n* Suicidal orders,\n* Orders that would cause financial ruin.\nThe rest of the time, bonnie obeyed Top -- all the rest of the time.\n\nObviously, relationships like this are totally cool with me as long as they are -- say it with\nme, everyone -- 100% consensual! Such relationships can also encourage the use of\ninteresting communication tactics, because many of the usual tactics don't feel right to the\nparticipants. For example, these relationships often take place between people who feel\nsuch a strong power dynamic that it would be almost impossible for the submissive to\nfeel comfortable safewording -- safewording can feel disconcertingly like a form of\nresistance.\n\nOne way of dealing with this problem is for both partners to keep journals that are open\nto the other partner. (With some couples, only the submissive keeps an open journal.)\nThey talk about their romantic feelings, they process their sexual encounters, they\narticulate anxieties, etc. Sometimes a partner will give the other one journal prompts to\nanswer. The idea is that it's easier to express these things when there's a designated space\nfor it outside the relationship; the journals mean that partners (especially submissives)\ncan talk about what they need without fearing that they're undermining the power\ndynamic.\n\nI find the concept of simultaneous journals intriguing for a number of reasons. One is that\nI've used similar tactics myself; I kept a private journal for many years, and once in a\nlong while I'd give entries to my partners when I needed to explain something\ncomplicated about my feelings. I only did this a few times, ever, but it was really\neffective when I did.\n\nLater, I took to writing love letters that I noticed were very similar to both my journal\nentries, and to the simultaneous relationship journals suggested for Master/slave couples.\nI realized that I was writing letters because, at the time, I felt more comfortable writing\nabout my desires than talking about them. I've gotten a million times better at talking\nabout my sexuality honestly and shamelessly since then; but back then, there were\ndefinitely things I wrote to my partners that I couldn't have said aloud.

But again, the mortician’ s relationship with those corpses may\nhave been purely platonic.\n\nLet us now eavesdrop on the dialogue of a few participants in an\n\nInternet support group, Necrophiliacs Anonymous:\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_015356\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

The heading read: \"The fool doth think he is wise\". \nIn fact, the message was from a prankster, using the Gmail account \niohn.mcfarlane.barclays@gmail. com.

Presumably thinking he was talking to his \nchairman, who has been dubbed \"Mack the Knife\" for his habit of ousting chief \nexecutives, Mr Staley said, \"You are a unique man, Mr McFarlane\". \n\"You came to my defense today with a courage not seen in many people. How do I thank \nyou?\" Mr Staley wrote. The 60-year-old Barclays boss continued in the same style: \"You \nhave a sense of what is right, and you have a sense of theatre. You mix humor with grit. \nThank you John. Never underestimate my recognition of your support. And my respect \nfor your guile.\" \nHe had time for yet more praise before he signed off. \"And some day I want to see an ad lib \nguitar run. You have all the fearlessness of Clapton,\" said Mr Staley, referencing the \nlegendary guitarist Eric Clapton and his chairman's fondness for playing his guitar in \npublic meetings. \nThe brief conversation ended with a final email around iipm. The imposter sent a poem, \nwhich began \"Worry not of tomorrow's end\" and ended \"Revel in their bloodied eyes\". \nThe first letter of each line spelled out the word `Whistleblower'. \n\"Thanks for sharing the foxhole,\" Mr Staley replied. \nThe prankster, who contacted the Financial Times via Twitter, told us the email was part \nof his \"battle with Barclays\" over a customer issue. \"I thought I'd see how Jes was relaxing \nafter his AGM,\" he said. \nBarclays declined to comment. \nThe emails, which the FT has verified are genuine, are reproduced below. \n[Prankster's email] \nFrom: John McFarlane [john.mcfarlane.barclays @gmail .com] \nSent: Wednesday, May 10, 2017 08:47 PM GMT Standard Time \nTo: Staley, Jes: Barclays (LDN) \nSubject: The fool doth think he is wise \nMason-Mahon is as brusque as he is ill informed. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 030360 \nHowever I do feel we've ceased the rally for you [sic] head today. \nSurely the fickleminded nature of the angry few will help tie up any loose ends. \nYou owe me a large Scotch. \nJohn \nSent from my iPhone \nOn Wed, 10 May 2017 at 21:o8, Jes Staley wrote: \nYou are a unique man, Mr McFarlane. \nYou came to my defense today with a courage not seen in many people.

At the very minimum, unpaid capex could be around\nSAR23bn. This is the amount of additional loans taken out by construction contractors\nover 2015 compared to 2014. Total construction loans were SAR106bn in 2015 versus\nSAR83bn in 2014. Contractors likely did not go to obtain alternative bank funding for\nthe same amount as the delayed payments from the government, suggesting delayed\npayments should be larger than SAR23bn, in our view.\n\nBy the same token, the 2015 budget outturns imply capex was down by 45% to\nSAR205bn versus 2014 levels of SAR370bn. This is of course unlikely as construction\ngrew by 5% in real terms in 2015. Correcting the 2015 budget by the likely\nunderreporting (an additional SAR100bn in spending, assuming it was all capex-related),\nthen capex spending was likely down by SAR65bn (17%) in 2015. This would be in line\nwith the c15%yoy drop in construction awards as reported by MEED.\n\nIn comparison, government overdues in the healthcare sector are much smaller. Based\non the disclosures of two listed healthcare groups, we estimate the growth of\ngovernment receivables owed to them alone is SARO.4bn. We estimate the total sector\ngovernment overdues to private healthcare operators could be 2-3 times this level.\n\n1OUs to serve multiple purposes\n\n1OUs could support simultaneously the multiple needs of the government, domestic\nbanks and contractors, in our view. The government will be able to conserve fiscal\nreserves and restructure the maturity of its outstanding dues. Domestic banks would\nsubstitute corporate credit risk with sovereign risk and improve asset quality, while\ncontractors could improve their liquidity and working capital position by cashing in early\non the IOUs. We believe most of the contractors impacted could be domestic ones, and\nwe presume these IOCs would be issued in domestic currency. Furthermore, to the\nextent these |OUs are structured as tradable instruments, this could better distribute\nrisk in the financial sector to those agents more capable or willing to hold it.\n\nDomestic liquidity could be eased, but Fx outflows may not subside\n\nThe impact of |OUs on domestic liquidity will likely depend on the issuance mechanism,\nof which we have little visibility for now, though this could likely ease domestic liquidity.\nWe would however expect subsequent Fx reserves losses due to an increase in demand\nfor Fx consequent to the liquidity injections (a 50% leakage would for instance lead to\nUSS13.5bn loss in Fx reserves at the high-end of the estimated arrears range).\n\nOne possibility for the mechanism would be for banks to extend more secured credit to\ncontractors using the lOUs as collateral. In this case, domestic liquidity is likely to\nremain tight as the banking sector balance sheet would stay stretched. Another, perhaps\nmore likely, option would be for banks to accept IOUs as deposits. Contractors would\nthen be able to transfer |OUs to their trade creditors and withdraw cash regularly, with\nthe total amount being likely a portion of the face value of the |OUs. Banks would hold\nnew government instruments on the asset side of their balance sheet. This mechanism\ncould also be structured as a simple sale of the IOUs to domestic banks (with a haircut),\nwhich domestic banks would accommodate through equivalent changes on the asset\nside of their balance sheet, without the creation of additional liabilities.\n\nIn the latter option, to avoid straining the banking sector liquidity, the deposits\nwithdrawal or in effect the increased money in circulation would likely require monetary\naccommodation from SAMA, in our view. We believe this could take the form of liquidity\ninjection, possibly through repo operations for the |OUs.

If that happens, it could open up the 58-year-old\nPalm Beach billionaire to a slew of federal charges involving sex\ncrimes with minors that were set aside by the agreement.\n\nThe motion, filed Monday in federal court in West Palm Beach,\naccuses the U.S. Attorney’s Office of deliberately misleading the\nvictims by telling them the investigation was ongoing, while\nconcealing they had already signed a deal with Epstein.\n\nAccording to the motion, the U.S. Attorney’s Office sent “false\nnotification” letters in January 2008 and May 2008 to the victims\nsaying “(t)his case is currently under investigation” after the\ngovernment had signed the agreement with Epstein in September\n2007.\n\n“The only reason that the (U.S. Attorney's Office) concealed the\nexistence of the non-prosecution agreement from the victims was\nnot to comply with some legal restriction, but rather to avoid a\nfirestorm of public controversy that would have erupted if the\nsweetheart plea deal with a politically connected billionaire had been\nrevealed,” the motion says.\n\nIf Epstein were found guilty on federal charges, statutory penalties\nranged from 10 years to life.\n\nInstead, the sealed pact was part and parcel of Epstein’s\nacceptance of a state plea deal, where he received an 18-month\nsentence for soliciting a minor for prostitution and soliciting\nprostitution. He served 13 months segregated in a vacant wing of\nthe county stockade and was let out on work release six days a\nweek for up to 16 hours a day.\n\nEdwards and other attorneys fought in court for a year before\nsuccessfully getting the agreement unsealed in September 2009.\nMore than 30 minor girls were identified as Epstein’s victims in the\npact.\n\nhttp://www.palmbeachdailynews.com/news /attorneys—-want-jeffrey-epstein-agreement-thrown-out-1338111.html\n\n4/7/11 1:37 PM\n\nPalm Beach, FL\nH: 84° L: 71°\n\nForecast | Set Location Feels Like: 85°\n\n| SEARCH\n\n® Site © Web Web Search by YAHOO!\n\nPALM BEACH ESTATE\n\nwi Pr be © He\n241 La Puerta Way, Palm Beach\n\nExquisitely designed Mediterranean Palm Beach\nwalled estate.\n\nal\n\ncorcoran.com\n\nas\n\nJe\n% 3\nTOWN OF PALM BEACH\n\n\\/ 1911+ CENTENNIAL + 2011 \\/\n\nID Click here for the latest events!

Another was treating prayer like a\npsychotherapy session. One congregant\nexplained: “It’s just like talking to a\ntherapist, especially in the beginning\nwhen you’re revealing things that are\ndeep in your heart and deep in your soul,\nthe things that have been pushed down\nand denied.” In these churches which\nemphasize God’s love and intimacy, hell\nand fear largely disappear.\n\nThe central demand of these\nlearning practices is to use one’s own\nmental experience as evidence and\ncontent for the responsive presence of\nthis God, who is believed to be other\nthan oneself, and to use pretend play to\nintegrate those mental events into a\nrepresentation that is persuasively\nexternal to the self. The emotional\npractices provide both direct evidence of\nGod’s love and, more generally,\nevidence that participation in church is\nsatisfying and worthwhile. In effect the\nprocess asks the congregants to carve\nGod out of their own experience and to\nexperience those phenomena as other;\nand it uses the emotional practices taught\nby the church and the social world of the\ncongregation to help them hold that God\nseparate and apart and lovingly\nresponsive.\n\nThis is hard work to do, and not\neveryone was able to do it, or to do it\neasily.

I’ll probably\nnever will and I don’t have it and I don’t\nwant it because it would scare me.”\n\nHere is another congregant who has been\nable to do so:\n\nNora: “It was pretty early on in my\nrelationship with him.

This varies from corpus to corpus as described above. For English, we spent a great\ndeal of time examining the data by hand as an additional check on its reliability. The other corpora may\nnot be as reliable.\n\n4) Quality of Metadata. Again, the English language corpus was checked very carefully and\nsystematically on multiple occasions, as described above and in the following sections. The metadata for\nthe other corpora may not be equally reliable for all periods. In particular, the Hebrew corpus during the\n19th century is composed largely of reprinted works, whose original publication dates farpredate the\nmetadata date for the publication of the particular edition in question. This must be borne in mind for\nresearchers intent on working with that corpus.\n\nIn addition to these four general issues, we note that earlier portions of the Hebrew corpus contain a large\nquantity of Aramaic text written in Hebrew script. As these texts often oscillate back and forth between\nHebrew and Aramaic, they are particularly hard to accurately classify.\n\nAll the above issues will likely improve in the years to come. In the meanwhile, users must use extra\ncaution in interpreting the results of culturomic analyses, especially those based on the various non-\nEnglish corpora. Nevertheless, as illustrated in the main text, these corpora already contain a great\ntreasury of useful material, and we have therefore made them available to the scientific community\nwithout delay. We have no doubt that they will enable many more fascinating discoveries.\n\nIII.0.2 On the number of books published\n\nIn the text, we report that our corpus contains about 4% of all books ever published. Obtaining this\nestimate relies on knowing how many books are in the corpus (5,195,769) and estimating the total\nnumber of books ever published. The latter quantity is extremely difficult to estimate, because the record\nof published books is fragmentary and incomplete, and because the definition of book is _ itself\nambiguous.\n\nOne way of estimating the number of books ever published is to calculate the number of editions in the\ncomprehensive catalog of books which was described in Section | of the supplemental materials. This\nproduces an estimate of 129 million book editions. However, this estimate must be regarded with great\ncaution: it is conservative, and the choice of parameters for the clustering algorithm can lead to significant\nvariation in the results. More details are provided in Ref $1.\n\nAnother independent estimate we obtained in the study \"How Much Information? (2003)\" conducted at\nBerkeley (Ref S6). That study also produced a very rough estimate of the number of books ever\npublished and concluded that it was between 74 million and 175 million.\n\nThe results of both estimates are in general agreement. If the actual number is closer to the low end of\nthe Berkeley range, then our 5 million book corpus encompasses a little more than 5% of all books ever\npublished; if it is at the high end, then our corpus would constitute a little less than 3%. We report an\napproximate value (about 4%) in the text; it is clear that, in the coming years, more precise estimates of\nthe denominator will become available.\n\nIII.1. Generation of timeline plots\n\nIII.1A. Single Query\n\nThe timeline plots shown in the paper are created by taking the number of appearances of an n-gram ina\ngiven year in the specified corpus and dividing by the total number of words in the corpus in that year.\nThis yields a raw frequency value.

Baran was born in Grodno, Poland in 1928. His father had an\nuneasy sense about what was coming to Europe and he moved the family to America\nwhen Paul was six. Pesach Baran became Paul Bran in America, a model student, a\nprize-winning mathematician and eventually at Hughes and Rand he established\nhimself as one of the great American engineers of his generation. And like so many\nrefugees of that era, the sharp, irreversible exodus left him with a question. How,\nexactly, to stay connected - to family, to tradition, to history? As the murderous mist\nof Nazism swept over Europe, the problem took on a searching urgency: How to\nmaintain a connection, any connection, in the face of utter catastrophe? As he neared\nretirement decades later, Baran recalled his life’s work with this resonant line: “I\nwas concerned,” he said, “with survivability.” The problem that animated his life as\nmuch as it did his networks.\n\nTwo years after arriving at RAND, Baran began to discern the outlines to a solution\nto the dangerous problem of American military communications. In a series of\nlectures for Air Force officers starting in the summer of 1961, Baran began working\nhis way towards an answer, speech by speech and equation by equation. He didn’t\nfully know where he was heading when he began the talks, he said, but he had an\ninstinct that some other design must be out there, some completely fresh way to\nhandle the “survivability problem” and by the end of his lecture tour, he had found\nit.\n\nBaran’s new design for a durable network had begun with an idea that didn’t work.\nThe Pentagon, he’d thought, might broadcast thousands of coded messages over AM\nradio frequencies all at once as an attack approached. “We interrupt this program to\nsay: It’s Christmas in July!” Missile silo commanders and bomber commanders\nwould cluster by their transistor radios, collecting a “launch” code with the ease of\nlistning to a late-night baseball game. That target-shaped, “Just Aim Here” web of\nphone lines would be replaced by something far more distributed, harder to wipe\nout with a single Semyorka-7 missile shot. But this approach had problems too. It\nrelied fatally on broadcast towers and on insecure AM radio waves. But the idea of\nsuch a widespread, insidiously untargettable network got Baran thinking. Sending\nout the messages and letting them find their own way had a lot of appeal, if it could\nbe done. There would be no central hubs. Information would sail over linked lines in\nthe way radio signals moved in the air. Military communications, in Baran’s system,\nwould bounce from point to point on this tapestry, at each stop being re-directed\ntowards their intended destination. The resulting network, if you drew it out, would\nlook like a fishnet: Lots of links connected to a few knotted nodes. And because the\nbundles of data, Baran called them packets, could be moved by the network itself,\nyou could cut or nuke or sabotage the net in a few places and still use it. The packets\nwould would find another path. Even a badly ripped up and irradiated network\ncould, in theory, carry a “launch” - or a recall - message safely from the White House\nto a bomber pilot.\n\n80\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_018312\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

This report is intended for amanda.ens@baml.com\n\nGEMs Paper #26\nSaudi Arabia: beyond oil but not so fast\n\nTransforming Saudi Arabia, but challenges abound\n\nThe Saudi National Transformation Plan (NTP) bodes well for comprehensive reform\nefforts to diversify the economy in line with Vision 2030. The NTP a) identifies key\nsectors with high growth potential; b) starts to articulate supportive public sector\nindustrial strategies; and c) seeks to foster higher value-added through enhancements to\nprocesses, products and organizations. Still, ambitious targets in a number of sectors are\nunlikely to be reached and medium-term macro sustainability is not yet clear.\n\nUSD peg holds but NTP inconsistent with stable FX policy\n\nOur view is still that the USD peg holds. However, the NTP provides a mixed message.\nOn the one hand, it blurs policymaking incentives given the need for a competitive Fx if\ndiversification progresses. On the other, unrealistic fiscal targets mean consolidation is\nlikely to fall short of easing imbalances materially without oil price recovery. Energy\npolicy thus likely needs to become less aggressive to support macro and FX policies.\n\nEurobond premium required for fiscal slippage risk\n\nWe expect large and regular sovereign Eurobond issuance to support FX reserves and\ndomestic liquidity but to weigh on regional bond spreads if risk appetite does not hold\nup or fiscal balance slips. EMBIG index inclusion is unlikely, in our view. Saudi forwards,\nCDS and rates are likely to stay under pressure due to issuance and tight liquidity.\n\nCommodities: NTP adds to medium-term oil tightness\n\nThe NTP suggestion that production capacity is maintained until 2020 reinforces our\nconviction of medium-term oil market tightness. The NTP gas production target that\ncould displace domestic crude demand and boost export capacity is challenging.\n\nEquity Strategy: six investible themes on the back of NTP\nWe see a number of investible themes emerging from the NTP which investors can use\nto identify potential beneficiaries. These themes include rising availability of affordable\nhousing, increased access to healthcare, down-trading as the consumer comes under\npressure, a surge in telecom infrastructure and significant opportunities in the\ndownstream petrochemical arena. Buy-rated names with access to these themes\ninclude: Al Hammadi, Savola, Al Othaim, STC, Zain KSA and SABIC.\n\nPartial NTP success & MSCI inclusion could drive rerating\n\nThe Saudi market trades on a 12m fwd P/E of c.13x, an 11% discount to the long-term\naverage and its lowest premium to GEMs since 2010. We believe that with earnings\nmomentum gradually reaching an inflection point a relatively negative outlook is already\nbeing priced in. Given our view that oil prices will gain strong momentum in 2017, even\na partial success of the NTP along with CMA market reforms to expedite inclusion in the\nMSCI EM index could be sufficient to improve confidence and thus drive a rerating.\n\nTrading ideas and investment strategies discussed herein may give rise to significant risk and are not\nsuitable for all investors.

Targets could be either purely computational,\naimed at the bringing down of computing systems, the stealing of stored information, of gaining access\nto monitoring activity and information streams. However, we are more likely to see potentially even\nmore costly attacks involving a combination of cyber and physical systems, e.g., uranium enrichment\nplants, automated flight systems, weapon systems, automated driving systems, healthcare equipment,\noil refineries, or the large swaths of the power grid of the US or other countries.\n\nCyberwarfare is a domain in which the use of Al is inevitable. Attacks and/or responses are likely to\nhappen at computing rather than human speeds. As soon as one side has autonomous cyber warriors\nsystems (ACWs), other actors will have to adapt similar offensive or new defensive technologies. Given\nthis context, imagine building an ACW designed to seek, disrupt, and destroy within high-value\nadversary networks and systems. The ACW has to be able to observe network behavior to build\nsituational awareness, find places to hide, create exploits to pivot to new places, build a map and use it\nto navigate complex networks, find high-value information, and identify targets to disable or from\nwhich to extract information.\n\nBecause high-value adversary networks are likely to be relatively isolated, the ACW will have very\nlimited opportunities for external command and control communication, so it will need to make many\ndecisions in isolation. It will read information it finds, build a model of adversarial intent, and then\ninvent ways to disrupt that intent.\n\nEstablishing the initial access to the high-value network is likely challenging, so the ACW will spawn and\nspread to ensure that it can reconstruct itself if an active part is observed and destroyed. The ACW may\nalso create disguised caches of specific capabilities so that it can construct new mission-oriented\nfunctionality from pieces. It will morph its active form so that defenses will have a hard time finding it.\nIt will inject itself into trusted binaries so that its behavior is difficult to distinguish from legitimate\napplications.\n\nThe mission of the ACW will likely be defined in flexible terms because the human handlers will have\nonly limited information when it is deployed. The ACW will be designed to seek opportunities to\ncommunicate with its human handlers, but it will also be designed to act autonomously if it observes\ntriggering behavior in the adversary’s systems. It may try to distinguish training states from active\nwarfare states on adversary systems. The creators of the ACW will have had to trade off the likely\neffectiveness of the ACW versus the cost of premature action. Awareness of the adversary’s systems\nwill necessarily be limited in accuracy because it only gets a worm’s eye view of the network from the\nportions of the system it has been able to compromise. Once the ACW triggers an active mission, it will\n\n10\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_014706\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

Prosecutors and other law enforcement\nofficials normally demand that those seeking a deal come to them.\n\nThe fact that Acosta didn’t is another sign — if one were needed — that this was a\ncapitulation. It also casts further doubt on the claim that Acosta was capitulating for the\npurpose of sparing the folks who worked with him in the prosecutor’s office.\n\nThe key point, though, is that Ken Starr and Jay Lefkowitz were power players in\nWashington — men who might help Acosta down the road.\n\nReaders will be quite familiar with Starr’s background. Lefkowitz was director of cabinet\naffairs and deputy executive secretary to the domestic policy council under President\nGeorge H.W. Bush. Under President George W. Bush, Lefkowitz served as general counsel\nin the Office of Management and Budget and later as deputy director of domestic policy at\nthe White House.\n\nAccommodating such influential figures must have seemed like a good career move.\nHaving Starr and Lefkowitz on his side might help Acosta get a judgeship, a cabinet\nappointment, or a high-paying job back at Kirkland and Ellis.\n\nI’m speculating, of course. But my speculation finds support in Acosta’s practice of\naccommodating the powerful.\n\nMuch of that accommodation is of Democrats. Indeed, at the time Acosta was working in\nMiami as a U.S. Attorney, he had alienated some Republicans by such accommodation\nwhile at the Department of Justice. Some say he was on the verge of being fired when\nAttorney General Alberto Gonzalez parachuted him to Miami. The Epstein settlement was a\nway for Acosta to shore up his standing with some influential Republicans.\n\nWill Acosta be able to survive the current scandal? I don’t have a clear sense about this yet.\nBut President Trump, who isn’t bashful about sacking cabinet members, may come to\nbelieve (if he doesn’t now) that it’s disadvantageous to have a cabinet member who sold out\nteenage victims of sexual abuse, especially when the sell-out benefited an ultra-wealthy\nserial offender.\n\n* Some on the left are trying to make something or the fact that Starr, who had investigated\nBill Clinton in connection with sexual misconduct, later defended Epstein, a pervert. This is\nsilly.\n\nIn both instances, Starr was doing his job as a lawyer. Perverts are entitled to a defense and\nthere is nothing hypocritical about investigating Bill Clinton’s misconduct when that was\nStarr’s job and later joining the team that was defending Jeffrey Epstein.\n\nAcosta, by contrast, was on the team seeking justice for Epstein and for his victims. He\ngave up this quest for reasons that can’t be defended.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_030960\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

Rodriguez\nwas sentenced to 18 months in federal prison (Epstein was allowed to serve 13 months in the\nPalm Beach county jail), and now awaits an additional sentence on Aug. 24 in federal court in\nMiami for transporting firearms, another deal he says he made to pay the bills after he lost his\njob.\n\nIn a deposition given for the civil suits, Rodriguez testified that he was instructed to always have\n$2,000 in cash on hand, so that he could pay both the girls who gave massages and recruiters\nsuch as Haley Robson who brought them to the house. He also testified that Epstein made large\ncontributions to the Palm Beach Police Department, and in return was given PBPD baseball hats\nto put on the dashboard of his various cars to avoid being stopped or ticketed by local police.\nRetired Police Chief Michael Reiter, in his own deposition, acknowledged that, in addition to\nearlier donations to the police department (which are fairly common in well-heeled Palm Beach),\nEpstein had recently given the department $100,000 for some sophisticated equipment. The\npolice were still researching the purchase when Epstein came under suspicion, and Reiter\nordered the money returned. (Guy Frostin, one of Epstein’s local attorneys, told police that\nEpstein also gave $100,000 to the Florida Ballet for massages, because he was ‘very passionate”\nabout massages being “therapeutically and spiritually” beneficial. Yet victims told police they\nhad no massage training.)\n\nPerhaps most disturbing, in terms of possible sex trafficking, was Epstein’s relationship with\nJean Luc Brunel, owner of the MC2 modeling agency. According to a complaint filed in the U.S.\nDistrict Court for the Southern District of Florida, an alleged victim said that Epstein, Maxwell,\nBrunel, Rodriguez, and Marcinkova “deliberately engaged in a pattern of racketeering that\ninvolved luring minor children through MC2, mostly girls under the age of 17, to engage in\nsexual play for money.” (Which would amount to trafficking.)\n\nBrunel is a 50-plus French playboy who was formerly part owner of Karin, a Paris-based\nmodeling agency. He lives in New York and South Beach, Florida, and owns 85 percent of MC2.,\nwhich has offices in New York, Miami, and Tel Aviv. (The remaining 15 percent is owned by\nhis partner, Jeff Fuller.) Brunel has been observed as a house guest at Epstein’s Palm Beach\nhome and may well have had contact with him also in New York, where Epstein owns a lavish\nhome, and in Paris, where Epstein keeps an apartment on elegant Ave. Foch.\n\nCBS reporter Craig Pyes, who investigated Brunel for a 60 Minutes broadcast many years ago, is\nquoted in Michael Gross” book about the modeling industry, Model: The Ugh: Business o\nBeautiful Women. Pyes told the author that Brunel “ranks among the sleaziest people in the\n\nfashion industry. We’re talking about a conveyor belt, not a casting couch. Hundreds of girls\nwere not only harassed but molested.” Now The Daily Beast has learned that Epstein had made a\n$1 million wire transfer to Brunel’s offshore bank account in September 2004, just as he was\nsetting up MC2. Whether this was a gift or a loan or a backdoor investment in the new venture is\nunknown. A French citizen who managed to avoid giving evidence in the Epstein investigation,\nBrunel declined to comment on any of this, as does Fuller.

It turns out, however, that\nBannon’s adversaries had underestimated him, because he is “‘as dangerous as ever,” he confesses.\n\nKramper cannot conceal his respect for Bannon’s ability to move a crowd. He was greeted by “frenetic\napplause” in his recent address before France’s National Front party, Kramper writes, demonstrating his\n“impressive potential,” which the writer describes as “dangerous.”\n\nIn the mind of his audience, Bannon is something of a miracle-worker, Stamper notes, having “done the\nimpossible” by bringing Donald Trump into the White House.\n\nThe reason Bannon is dangerous, Kramper continues, is because he “lays out the political program of a\nworldwide right: He has already conquered the USA; now Europe and then the whole world will follow.”\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_025534\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

Real estate was the world's favorite money laundering currency and Trump's\nperceived A -level real estate business was quite explicitly designed to appeal to money\nlaunderers. What’s more, Trump’s own financial woes, and desperate efforts to maintain\nbillionaire lifestyle, cache, and market viability, forced him into constant and unsubtle\nschemes. Practically speaking, you couldn’t miss him, as the Mueller investigation\nappeared to be finding.\n\nIn November 2004, for instance, Jeffrey Epstein, the financier later caught in a scandal\ninvolving under-age prostitutes, agreed to buy out of bankruptcy a house in Palm Beach,\nFlorida for $36 million—a house that had been on the market for two years. Epstein and\nTrump had been close friends—playboys in arms, as it were—for more than a decade,\nwith Trump always hopeful that Epstein would provide some of his financial expertise to\nenabvle h8im to survive. Trump was beholden to Deutsch Bank and was on the hook\npersonally for 40 million dollars.\n\nEpstein took Trump to see the Palm Beach house to advise him on construction issues\ninvolved with moving the swimming pool. As he prepared to finalize his deal for the\nhouse, an incredulous Epstein saw a severely cash-constrained Trump bid $41 million for\nthe property, buying it through an entity named Trump Properties LLC, ultimate owner\nunknown. . Trump, Epstein knew, had been in the buisness of leasing his name. Hotels are\nactually owned by others but renting the trump name would cost a percent or two. ,\nTrump was willing to serve as a front man to disguise the actual ownership in a real estate\ntransaction. (This was, in effect, just another variation of Trump’s basic business model of\nlicensing his name for commercial properties owned by someone else.) A furious Epstein\nsuspected that others actually owned the new house. then getting extensive scrutiny in\nFlorida papers. The disagreement re the purchase of the house became all the more bitter\nwhen, two months later, the house was put on the market for $125 million. Well known to\nTrump, who often visited with Epstein at his Palm Beach house, whose visits were\nconfirmed in depostions of Epsteins houseman. It appears that Epstein was visited almost\nevery day, by and had been for many years, by girls who he paid for massages with happy\nendings—girls recruited, and who often returned to his house from the local massage\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_030974\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

But in the course of conversations I've had recently, as a I research a new book \non President Trump and the forces arrayed against him, what has become clear is that Robert Mueller and his \noffice are preparing for a life or death confrontation with the President and the mother of all constitutional \ncrises. \nMy discussions have been with both White House advisors and people close to the investigation. No source \ninvolved in this story would speak on the record. \nThe sources firmly believe that Special Counsel has ready an aggressive legal theory for the indictment of \nthe president for obstruction of Justice. In the last few weeks, as the President has indulged his pardon \nauthority, the Mueller team has also developed a legal strategy to oppose the ikely pardon of former National \nSecurity Advisor, Michael Flynn, who had previously struck a plea bargain which could include his testimony \nagainst the President. \nRobert Mueller, according to one person familiar with the Special Counsel's thinking, could hardly contain \nhis disgust when Rudy Giuliani, the President's new lawyer—hired to makes a television case for the President \nand to push back against the Mueller team—in May airily dismissed the notion that a president can be indicted. \nAdding insult to injury, Giuliani—who a White House source said had likely learned of aspects of the pending \nindictment—said Mueller agreed with that assessment. White House sources believe Giuliani was daring the \nSpecial Counsel to tip his hand. Mueller, in character, contained his outrage and continued to hold his cards \nclose as his team finished preparing the obstruction case and refined the legal theories under which it would \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 030402 \nclaim the right to haul the president into court. \nThe Mueller team, according to sources both near the investigation and the White House, has prepared a \ncase, but it requires the approval of Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who—with the recusal of \nAttorney General Jeff Sessions from the Russia-related investigation—oversees the Mueller team. He would \nneed to set aside He could do this based on a finding that the former opinion was inaccurate re the president \nbeing above the law. ttherby creating an inability to indict a sitting president. Indeed, Rosenstein, as recently \nas April, publicly declared that the President was not a target. This may have been a form of fig leaf to soothe a \nPresident who regularly demands aides assure him he is not being pursued: the President does not become a \nformal target until Rosenstein agrees to designate him as one. \nAny proposed indictment would confront Rosenstein with matters with which he has been intimately \ninvolved. The case, according to my conversations , is fundamentally Trump versus the FBI, Justice \nDepartment, and Mueller investigation itself. In many ways, it boils down to the word of former FBI Director \nJames Comey against the word of Donald Trump. Rosenstein, at the President's behest, drafted a memo \njustifying the Comey firing for how the former FBI Director handled the Hillary Clinton email investigation. \nBut that justification, in an embarrassment for Rosenstein, was shortly brushed aside by the President when he \nadmitted that he fired Comey to disrupt the Russian investigation. What's more, the indictment is said to charge \nthat the firing of Andrew McCabe, the former Deputy Director of the FBI, who reported directly to Rosenstein \nafter the Comey dismissal, was an instance of illegal retaliation tampering or consipracy by the President \nagainst a potential witness. \nAccording to a source with knowledge of the strategy, it will be all the more controversial because if finds \nthe entire narrative of the case for obstruction in plain sight. Almost nothing about the case involves new \ninformation. \"This indictment could have been drafted without anyone being interviewed,\" said this source. \nRather it takes well covered public events and moves them to a set of circumstantial conclusions. There is no \nsmoking gun beyond the often flagrant, custom-breaking, events of the President's 16 months in office. Indeed, \nmuch of the evidence is based on the President's public statements and tweets about those events. \nThis is, according to White House sources who have gotten wind of this approach, good news: the case then, \nis just an issue of what motives you ascribe to the President's behavior—behavior that is, the President's \nsupporters believe it is easy to show, impulsive and not thought out. Hence no intent. For the Mueller team, it \nis precisely that careless behavior and flagrant disregard for the rules that they aim to put on trial. \nThere is no certainty that the Special Counsel's office will ultimately pursue its plan to indict the President. \nBut, according to a source the worry is that the plan is \"more advanced\" than previosly believed. . The \ninvestigation continues and new evidence or other factors might push both prosecutors and the grand jury in \nanother direction. Just passing its first anniversary, the Mueller investigation has conducted itself with \nremarkable secrecy. Descriptions of a proposed indictment provide one of the few insights into its strategy and \nits sense of the political peril in front of it. \nIt may be noteworthy that there appears now not to be plan for an indictment related to collusion, although, \nlegal experts say, that could come later. \nThe White House view is that without the underlying collusion charge, Mueller will be presenting a weak \nand politically-motivated case. The Mueller view seems to be that the obstruction charges go to the heart of \nexposing how Trump has abused his power and turned the White House into a corrupt fiefdom. \nThe President's scheme to obstruct the FBI's investigation into connections between the Trump campaign \nand Russian efforts to undermine the U.S. election, according to Mueller began on the 7th day of the Trump \nadministration. Three days prior to this, on January 24, National Security Advisor, Michael Flynn, lied to the \nFBI about his contacts with the Russian Ambassador, Sergey Kislyak. These were contacts, directed by an \nunnamed person. \nThat unnamed person, in the view of several lawyers who discussed the case with me, is very likely Trump \nhimself, and might imply that Trump encouraged Flynn to lie to the FBI, promising to protect him—using his \ninfluence or pardon powers. \nOn January 27th, seven days after Donald Trump's inauguration, the President had the one-on-one dinner \nwith FBI \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 030403 \nplease note \nThe information contained in this communication is \nconfidential, may be attorney-client privileged, may \nconstitute inside information, and is intended only for \nthe use of the addressee.

John Kerry, various members\nof the Kennedy clan and former British Prime Minister Tony Blair, among many others.\n\nThe British press has been having a field day digging up new details about Epstein’s friendship with Prince Andrew.\nVirginia Roberts — known only as Jane Doe 102 in court papers — has been dishing her story to London’s Daily Mail.\nDetails include Roberts having been in the company of the prince three times at Epstein’s behest.\n\nRoberts also recounted meeting Clinton on Epstein’s private Caribbean island, according to the Mail.\n\nBut Roberts made no suggestion of sexual relations with Prince Andrew or with Clinton, the Mail reported. Similarly,\nthere is no suggestion of anything salacious with any of the Palm Beachers listed among the money manager's contacts.\n\nRoberts — who spent four years with Epstein — refers to him as “a monster” who paid her lavishly to satisfy his and his\nfriends sexual whims — although Roberts doesn’t identify the friends.\n\nBritish papers also have reported that Ferguson accepted £15,000 from Epstein. The money was paid to her former\nassistant, who claimed Ferguson owed him unpaid wages and other bills. Ferguson has since told the Mail and other\nBritish papers that she made “a gigantic error of judgment” in accepting the money from Epstein and that she will pay\nhim back.\n\nThe entire “Grail” was made public as part of a pending civil court case in which Epstein is suing attorney Brad Edwards,\nwho represented several underage girls who sued Epstein.\n\nEpstein sued Edwards, alleging he was involved in false claims made by Ponzi schemer Scott Rothstein; Edwards\ncountersued Epstein, saying he filed a frivolous lawsuit to get him to back down from representing the young women.\n\nAll the lawsuits against Epstein said his modus operandi in the initial visit was the same: The girls were taken to\nEpstein’s Palm Beach mansion and led upstairs to a spa room by one of Epstein’s assistants, where he would ask the\ngirls to perform sexually charged massages and/or various sex acts, for which he would pay them.\n\nOther high-profile names in Epstein’s book include Special Envoy for Middle East Peace George Mitchell, New York City\nMayor Michael Bloomberg, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, Barbara Walters, Alec Baldwin, Ralph Fiennes, George\nHamilton, Dustin Hoffman, Kevin Spacey, Liz Hurley, Lauren Hutton, Janice Dickinson, Naomi Campbell, Christy\nTurlington, Henry Kissinger, Joan Rivers, Courtney Love, Mick Jagger, Cornelia Guest, Phil Collins, Itzhak Perlman,\nSimon LeBon, Charlie Rose, Richard Branson, playwright Candace Bushnell, designers Tom Ford and Vera Wang, soap\nopera actress Nadia Bjorlin and erotic film star Koo Stark, who once dated Prince Andrew.\n\nAmong the high-powered Palm Beachers listed in the money manager’ss address book are Catherine and Fred Adler,\nSamantha and Serena Boardman, Jimmy and Jane Buffett, Pepe Fanjul, Conrad and Barbara Black, Gerry Goldsmith,\nMarjorie Gubelman, Dana Hammond, David Koch, Henry Kravis, Frayda and George Lindemann Sr., Bob and Todd\nMeister, Alfred Taubman, Stanley, Bea and Brett Tollman, and Martin Trust.\n\nGaston Cantens, a spokesman for Florida Crystals Corp., said Fanjul and Epstein “obviously knew each other and had\nsome contact in the past.

Historically, dividends have made a\nsubstantial contribution to total returns, and we expect this to remain\nthe case in the current environment.\n\ne Western winners from emerging market growth (sourced from\nexisting equity holdings)\nEmerging economies continue to grow faster than developed\neconomies. With little need to deleverage and repair balance sheets,\nAsian economies are also well positioned to continue to outpace their\nWestern peers in the years ahead. We have identified companies from\na variety of sectors in Europe, the US and Japan which have significant\nexposure to the rapidly growing emerging regions. We believe a\ndiversified portfolio of these companies will reward investors seeking\nto profit from the robust demand growth in emerging economies.\n\ne Natural gas growth gainers (sourced from existing equity\nholdings)\nNatural gas is a relatively clean source of energy, and we think it will\nbenefit from continued substitution for other energy sources over the\nlong term. We have examined the dynamics of the global market and\nthe various components of the gas value chain, and identified the\nareas we see as the most significant beneficiaries currently. These\ninclude producers in Europe and Asia, suppliers of infrastructure,\nservices and related machinery, and Master Limited Partnerships (MLPs)\nin the US, that offer both attractive yields and growth.\n\ne EM corporates: a growing asset class (sourced from global\ngovernment bonds - CIO UW)\nGiven our relatively constructive current view on risk, we regard EM\ncorporate debt as more attractive than EM sovereign debt due to its\nhigher overall yield. Over a 6-month horizon, we expect EM corporate\nbonds to outperform US Treasuries and deliver total returns of close to\n4%.\n\n2 UBS\n\nGovernment bond alternatives (sourced from government bonds -\nclo UW)\n\nDeveloped world government bonds offer a comparatively small cushion\nagainst future interest rate hikes and many face increasing credit risk. We\nexpect selected bonds of supranational or national agencies, sub-national\ngovernments, multinational corporates, and covered bonds to outperform\ngovernment bonds. We recommend switching out of government bonds\ninto these alternatives.\n\nUS high yield corporate bonds (sourced from government bonds -\nclo UW)\n\nPositive economic growth, robust corporate earnings and healthy balance\nsheets provide support to US high yield corporate bonds. Current yield\nspreads of 540 basis points still price in a more dire economic outcome\nthan we expect. Historically, US high yield bonds have delivered similar\nreturns as US equities with lower volatility. We continue to believe that\nUS high yield corporate bonds represent a more favorable risk/return\npotential than equities and expect mid single digit returns over the next 6\nmonths. Senior loans are exposed to similar positive fundamentals, and\noffer an attractive, floating rate alternative to US high yield.\n\nThe place to be in Hedge Funds\n\nGrowth in most developed markets remains muted. In this environment,\nless directional hedge fund strategies, such as relative value and event\ndriven, should offer above average returns.\n\nEM currencies: An underappreciated asset class (sourced from\ngovernment bonds - CIO UW)\n\nThe currencies of emerging countries, collectively as an asset class and\nmeasured using total returns (i.e. including interest received), have the\npotential to contribute positively to the longer-term returns of a well-\ndiversified portfolio. We believe that this is especially relevant now that\nthe developed world is settling into an extended period of very low\ninterest rates.\n\n* = New theme\n\nPlease see important disclaimer and disclosures at the end of the document.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_025253\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

People and\norganizations seek Al systems that bring new abilities to the table. We desire autonomous cars that\ndrive without collisions, we medical assistants that can diagnose patients accurately and we would like\nto have household assistants that can infer our intentions and execute them flawlessly —and even\nproactively. The military wants Al systems that can help with strategy and tactics, and systems that\noutmaneuver human led troops, and anticipate and respond to threats either on timescales that\nhumans cannot achieve, or over landscapes humans cannot cover.\n\nToday, there is still skepticism about performance of Al systems in a variety of domains. However, we\nexpect that Al systems will become more central decision support, pattern recognition, autonomous\ndecision making, and other types of problem solving. As such, we will become increasingly reliant on Al\nsystems. This raises concerns in several areas, including personal decision support, healthcare,\ntransportation, governance and the handling and operation of weapon systems.\n\nWe shall consider example of healthcare from Gireeja Ranade. The scenario and trajectory applies to\nother areas as we consider the increasing role and power of Al in our lives and in society:\n\nAs healthcare providers are increasingly stretched in providing consultations with patients, diagnosing\nconditions, and developing treatment and/or intervention plans, tech companies identify a market\nopportunity for Al-based digital assistants that are designed to augment healthcare providers by\ncollecting data from consultations, cross-referencing it with existing medical records, and providing\nfeedback to aid appropriate diagnosis and decisions on how to proceed with treatment. Given the\neconomic and health-base potential of the technology, it receives widespread support from the federal\ngovernment (predominantly through grants and initiatives supporting it’s development), together with\nhealthcare providers and healthcare insurance companies.\n\nInitial implementations are based on modular systems that share some commonalities with digital\nassistants like Siri and Echo/Alexa. Under the general name “Al-consult”, they consist of a physical unit\nin a consulting room that constantly monitors conversations, and sends encoded information to cloud-\nbased servers. Here, information is coded, interpreted, and parsed out to further agents that cross-\nreference interpreted data with identified patient and healthcare provider records. Multiple and\ndiverse databases are interrogated at this point. The result is data packets that include key information\non the patient, including medical history, life style, and current status, and on the healthcare provider,\nincluding past history of diagnoses, recommendations, successes and failures. These are forwarded to\na dedicated Al engine that analyzes the packets, and returns notes, advice and recommendations to\nthe physical unit in the consultation room.\n\n17\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_014713\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

Such technology could be deployed against law enforcement targets to disrupt criminal\ninvestigations, against banks to steal financial assets, or against companies to steal intellectual\nproperty. As they spread into these more general targets, the effects of ACWs might become less\npredictable. If an ACW incorrectly assesses the situation, it might end up taking down a flight control\ncenter or a stock exchange, for example.\n\nSOURCES\n\nThe initial development of ACWs will likely be done by nation states with good intentions, i.e., securing\nthe national interests. (Although what is in one country’s national interest may well not be in the\nnational interest of other countries). The shared existence of such technology might serve as a\ndeterrent against their use by anyone in much the same way that nuclear weapons have served as a\ndeterrent, although ACWs would likely have to be used to devastating effect first to establish their\nefficacy and threat. However, once the technology exists, it would be very difficult to keep it out of the\nhands of people with malicious intent (criminals, terrorists, and rogue nation states). It is also the case\nthat the technology has the potential to cause significant collateral damage even if its use was\noriginally well intentioned because it can be difficult to distinguish civilian from military targets in\ncyberspace.\n\nPERSISTENCE\n\nCharacteristics engineered into the ACW are likely to make it persistent and hard to find as it is\ndesigned to infiltrate adversary systems and hide from detection. Once released and active in the open\nInternet, it may be economically impossible to destroy and remove.\n\nOBSERVABILITY\n\nBoth implicit/insidious and explicit/obvious costly outcomes are conceivable. An ACW could make\nsubtle changes to systems that cause adverse outcomes while hiding its tracks, making it extremely\ndifficult to determine why something has gone wrong or even that something has gone wrong. Attacks\nthat impact the physical world would be harder to mask, but it might still be possible to hide the role of\nthe ACW in the attack.\n\nTIME FRAME\n\nIt seems likely we would start to see ACWs in less than 15 years. Initial steps along these lines are\nalready taking place; see DARPA’s Cyber Grand Challenge, which took place in August 2016 in Las\nVegas. The Cyber Reasoning Systems (CRS) that competed in that event are still primitive, the first of\ntheir kind. The team that won the competition came in last in the human-league capture-the-flag\ntournament that happened immediately after.

The federal non-prosecution agreement has\nbeen under seal in state court.\n\nEpstein's attorney Jack Goldberger filed court papers asking that the documents stay sealed for the following rea-\nsons: \"to prevent a serious imminent threat to the fair, impartial and orderly administration of justice; to protect a com-\npelling government interest; to avoid substantial injury to innocent third parties and to avoid substantial injury to a party\nby disclosure of matters protected by a common law and privacy right, not generally inherent in these specific type of\nproceedings, sought to be closed.\"\n\nFort Lauderdale-based attorney Brad Edwards represents three Epstein victims and has asked Circuit Judge Jeffrey\nColbath to unseal the federal agreement to the public.

The rebuilding of Indonesia. Or New Orleans. Or both. Go there. I've just been. You \nwill never think the same way about anything again.\" \nSo spoke not Bill or Melinda Gates, but Ghislaine Maxwell, the 48-year-old woman being written up everywhere at \nthe moment as the alleged \"procurer\" of young women for billionaire Jeffrey Epstein. \nEpstein, 57, is the financier who spent a year in jail on charges of soliciting prostitutes—and now there is talk of \nanother investigation because various women, now in their twenties and thirties, have come forward with \nallegations that he molested them when they were under-age. The allegations first surfaced in British newspapers, \nwhich have zeroed in on Epstein's friendship with Prince Andrew, who has recently tried to publicly disassociate \nhimself from his old pal. \nI wrote a piece for Vanity Fair in 2003 called \"The Talented Mr. Epstein.\" It was largely a business piece that focused \non his mysterious exit from Bear Stearns in 1981, his close relationships with Jimmy Cayne, Les Wexner, the \nchairman of Limited Brands, and above all, the man who claimed to be his mentor, Steven Jude Hoffenberg, who is \ncurrently serving a 20-year-jail sentence for bilking investors in Towers Financial out of $450 million. \nThe piece alluded to Epstein's great friendship with Maxwell, and how she introduced him to young women with \nwhom he had sexual relationships. But, in the end, the story didn't really go there, focusing instead on the issue that \nremains a mystery—how Jeffrey made his money, and how Ghislaine made hers. \nThis is not to say I didn't hear stories about the girls. I did. But, not knowing quite who to believe, I concentrated on \nthe intriguing financial mystery instead. But now the women have come back. Not the same ones, different ones. \nAnd their stories are bone-chilling. Journalists from England have phoned—and, in one case, flown—to ask me \nabout Epstein and Maxwell. Who is he? And the British, especially, want to know: Who is she? At this point, I am so \nbored of repeating myself to others—it was, after all, my 2003 Vanity Fairstory that really brought him into the \nlimelight—that I have decided to write about this myself. \nBizarrely, perhaps, I have gotten to know Jeffrey and Ghislaine far better after my piece than before it. I kept \nrunning into both of them, separately, at parties. Jeffrey is not a social animal so he usually has a couple of young \nwomen with him who stand two feet behind him, as if serving a monarch. \"Do they speak?\" I remember asking him \nonce, nodding at his lookalike blondes. He laughed. \"Not like you,Vicky,\" was his riposte. \nI remembered that when we'd once discussed math—in particular, an isosceles triangle—and I revealed I hadn't \nstudied math since I was 14 (such is, or was, the way of the British educational system), I received a package at \nhome via messenger. It was a book: \"Math for idiots.\" \nSo he is not without humor, even though he doesn't drink or smoke, and hates restaurants. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 030417 \n\"Jeffrey knows a good deal about most subjects,\" newspaper publisher Mort Zuckerman told me last week. He was \ncertainly preaching to the converted. The truth is, Epstein does know a lot about a lot of things. Just a few moments \nin his company and you know this to be true. \nWhen I saw pictures of Prince Andrew walking in Central Park with Jeffrey, my immediate thought was that \n\"Andy\"—as Jeffrey calls him—is probably asking for help with his role as British trade envoy, or whatever his strange \ntitle is. Because if one thing's for sure: When it comes to international business, Jeffrey knows what he's talking \nabout far more than \"Andy\" does. Which is why Leon Black, Mort Zuckerman and a few other financiers hang out \nwith him. \nAnd Ghislaine? \nFull disclosure: I like her. Most people in New York do. It's almost impossible not to. \nShe is always the most interesting, the most vivacious, the most unusual person in any room. I've spent hours \ntalking to her about the third world at a bar until 2am. She is as passionate as she is knowledgeable. She is curious. \nShe has spent weeks at the bottom of the ocean, literally going deeper than anyone else. She has sent me a DVD of \nthe fish there. Her rolodex would blow away almost anyone else's I can think of—probably even Rupert Murdochs'. \nShe is very well-read and can talk about most things for hours. She is passionate about Bill Clinton with whom she is \nclose friends. \nYet, touchingly, when she had to give a speech at the 40th birthday party of her best friend, Ariadne Calvo-Platero, \n(known fondly to her close friends as \"the Tennis Goddess\") Ghislaine shook a little with nerves. When it comes \ndown to things she really cares about—and Ariadne is one of them—Ghislaine shows her vulnerability. \nAnd that vulnerability is key to understanding her friendship with Jeffrey. \n\"He saved her,\" I remember a close friend of mine telling me. \"When her father died, she was a wreck; inconsolable. \nAnd then Jeffrey took her in. She's never forgotten that—and never will.\" \nIn many ways, the socially awkward Epstein with his big house, plane, island and ranch was the perfect replacement \nfor her father, the late Robert Maxwell, newspaper tycoon and criminal. Sure, Jeffrey had his sexual pecadillos, but \nthen Ghislaine's father was not without his oddities. After all, it was he who died leaving a massive \"black hole\" he'd \nfraudulently created. To Ghislaine, Jeffrey's habits may not have seemed that strange. \nIn fact, she probably figured, rather like I have, after years of writing about he very rich, that most successful people \nin the end either have some weird habit (the late Bruce Wasserstein had the weight issues, the girl issues, and \nmoved countries to avoid paying tax), or they break the law (Sam Waksal, Martha Stewart.) You don't tend to get to \nthe top by being the world's most balanced human being. Even the folksy Warren Buffett didn't quite manage a \nnormal life—whatever that is. He had a second \"wife\" for many years whose existence he has been open about. \nSo what to make of the current fuss over Ghislaine? I haven't spoken to her or to Jeffrey, but I suspect that her \nloyalty to friends like Bill Clinton will keep her in good stead, in the end, she'll be out and about as always. Look at \nWaksal and Stewart. No one sees them and thinks: criminal. Au contraire. In this city, money makes up for all sorts \nof blemishes. \n*********************************************************** \nThe information contained in this communication is \nconfidential, may be attorney-client privileged, may \nconstitute inside information, and is intended only for \nthe use of the addressee.

But what is\nparticularly disturbing about this case—judging by arrangements at the Palm Beach house—is\nthat Epstein, a billionaire hedge-fund manager, organized his life around this sexual compulsion\nin an open and methodical way that suggests he felt he was beyond the law.\n\n* Conchita Sarnoff: Epstein Faces Sex Traffic Probe\n\n* Billionaire Pedophile Goes Free\n\nAccording to police who executed a search warrant, the house was decorated with large, framed\nphotos of nude young girls, and similar images were found stashed in an armoire and on the\ncomputers seized at the house (although police found only bare cables where other computers\nhad been). Some bathrooms were stocked with soap in the shape of sex organs, and various sex\ntoys, such as a “twin torpedo” vibrator and creams and lubricants available at erotic specialty\nshops, were stowed near the massage tables set up in several rooms upstairs.\n\nEpstein also enlisted his staff in the predatory activity, and four—Sarah Kellen, Adriana Ross,\nLesley Groff, and Marcinkova—figured in the FBI investigation. The Non Prosecution\nAgreement stipulated that they would not be charged. According to police reports and swom\nstatements in the civil suits, all four women, among their other duties, worked to ensure that an\nappointment book for twice- or thrice-daily “massages” was stocked with fresh recruits.\nGhislaine Maxwell, daughter of the late Czechoslovakian-born press baron Robert Maxwell, who\nwas for many years Epstein’s live-in partner, also recruited young girls.\n\nSince his 13-month sentence for soliciting prostitution with a minor, Epstein has settled more\nthan a dozen lawsuits brought by underage girls. Seven victims reached a last-minute deal last\nweek, days before a scheduled trial; each received well over $1 million—an amount that will\nhardly dent Epstein's $2 billion net worth.\n\nThe victims told police they waited in the kitchen to be called upstairs for a massage, and the\nhouse chef often gave them a bite to eat. House manager Alfredo Rodriguez said in his sworn\nstatement that a maid named Lupita, who was a devout Catholic, wept when she complained to\nhim about cleaning up after the massage sessions, picking up soiled towels and putting away the\nsex toys. And she was upset that a photo of Epstein with the pope hung next to one of him with a\nyoung girl.\n\nIronically, Rodriguez, who ran the house on El Brillo Way in 2004 and 2005, ended up being\nsentenced to more jail time than his boss as a result of the complex investigation into Epstein’s\nactivities. He was fired, he says, for inadvertently drawing police attention to one of the girls\nwhen she arrived at the house unannounced to collect money. He saw an unfamiliar “beater” in\nthe driveway one evening and called 911. When he left Epstein’s employ, Rodriguez took away\nsome notes and emails about massage appointments as “protection” against his own prosecution,\nand failed to produce them during the Palm Beach Police Department’s initial investigation.\n\nUnable to get work as a house manager elsewhere in South Florida, he says, Rodriguez later tried\nto sell this “golden nugget”—his term—for $50,000, to be used in the victims’ civil suits.\n\n19\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_011930\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

Objective: an alliance\nbetween right-wing leaders, from Salvini to Orban in view of the 2019 elections\n\nNEW YORK. The invasion of Europe has begun. Steve Bannon, 65, the American far-right guru\nwho was Donald Trump’s right-hand man in the White House — but let go last summer following\nthe racist violence in Charlottesville — is preparing to march on Brussels. Launching, he told the\nDaily Beast himself, a new non-profit foundation called The Movement, (Il Movimento), right in the\nheart of Europe and its institutions. Through which he hopes to coordinate the populist right in view\nof the European elections which will be held in spring 2019.\n\nObjective: to compete with George Soros, the American billionaire of Hungarian origin, benefactor\nof the Democratic party, who since 1984 with his Open Society has spent at least $32 billion in\nsupport of NGOs dealing with human rights. And for this he became the bogeyman of the populist\nright, accused of plots of all kinds: including that of wanting to replace Italians with immigrants in\norder to have labour at low cost. A mantra repeated in the past on Twitter also by the current\nMinister of the Interior Matteo Salvini.\n\nThe ambition of Steve Bannon, former director of the alt-right American site Breitbart — which in\nthe European campaign preceded him since the platform had already opened bureaux in London and\nRome — is therefore to become the coordinator of the one great “populist international” of which he\nhas long since been dreaming.\n\nThe Movement, in fact, intends to function as an extreme right-wing think tank: a source of strategic\nadvice to channel the not-so-politically structured discontent of the most extreme European\nmovements. Analysing data and giving strategic advice. But also by raising funds and channeling\nfunding.\n\nThe aim is to create a populist alliance, a sort of “super group” that if victorious can conquer up to a\nthird of the European Parliament in the elections next May.\n\nIndeed — putting the common policy of the Old Continent in the hands of Bannon and his own. The\nAmerican strategist is very attached to the Freedom Caucus — the extreme right of the US Congress\n— and in 2014 he was at the top of the Cambridge Analytica company, which in 2016 used data\nstolen from Facebook to try to influence the presidential election from which Donald Trump\nemerged victor.

The event drew\nthousands of protestors to the streets, clamoring against the leading Islamist Ennahda party. The events heighten\nthe Islamist-secular divide that has featured in the Tunisian transition and the Arab Spring at large. Tunisian Prime\nMinister Hamadi Jebali described the event as the “assassination of the Tunisian revolution” and promised to\ndissolve the Islamist-led government and form a technocrat government aimed at promoting national unity at this\ndivisive time.\n\nEgypt: The second anniversary of the Egyptian revolution on January 25\" was marked less by celebration than it\nwas by violence, culminating in a week of unrest that took the lives of more than 50 people. The week was also\nmarked by the imposition of a curfew, state of emergency, and large military deployment in the cities of Suez,\nIsmailliya, and Port Said.

The spotlight, however, was on Mahmoud\nAhmadinejad: the first Iranian president to visit Egypt since the 1979 Islamic revolution.\n\nLibya: On January 31“, European Union foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton announced the launch of a two-\nyear civil mission to help secure Libya’s 4,000-kilometer border. The announcement was complemented by a\nsurprise visit to Tripoli by David Cameron, who also announced his government’s commitment to helping the\nLibyan military and police with training and support.

An issu-\ner’s responsibility thus extends to ensuring that subsidiaries\nor affiliates under its control, including foreign subsidiar-\nies and joint venture partners, comply with the accounting\nptovisions. For instance, DOJ and SEC brought enforce-\nment actions against a California company for violating the\nFCPA’s accounting provisions when two Chinese joint ven-\ntures in which it was a partner paid more than $400,000 in\nbribes over a four-year period to obtain business in China.”\nSales personnel in China made the illicit payments by obtain-\ning cash advances from accounting personnel, who recorded\nthe payments on the books as “business fees” or “travel and\nentertainment” expenses. Although the payments were made\nexclusively in China by Chinese employees of the joint ven-\nture, the California company failed to have adequate internal\ncontrols and failed to act on red flags indicating that its affili-\nates were engaged in bribery. The California company paid\n$1.15 million in civil disgorgement and a criminal monetary\npenalty of $1.7 million.\n\nCompanies may not be able to exercise the same level\nof control over a minority-owned subsidiary or affiliate as\nthey do over a majority or wholly owned entity. Therefore,\nif a parent company owns less than 50% of a subsidiary or\naffiliate, the parent is only required to use its best efforts\nto cause the minority-owned subsidiary or affiliate to\ndevise and maintain a system of internal accounting con-\ntrols consistent with the issuer’s own obligations under\nthe FCPA. In evaluating an issuer’s good faith efforts,\nall the circumstances—including “the relative degree of\nthe issuer’s ownership of the domestic or foreign firm and\nthe laws and practices governing the business operations\nof the country in which such firm is located”—are taken\n\ninto account.2””\n\nCivil Liability for Individuals and Other Entities\n\nCompanies (including subsidiaries of issuers) and\nindividuals may also face civil liability for aiding and abet-\nting or causing an issuer’s violation of the accounting pro-\nvisions.”** For example, in April 2010, SEC charged four\nindividuals—a Country Manager, a Senior Vice President\nof Sales, a Regional Financial Director, and an International\nController of a U.S. issuer—for their roles in schemes to\nbribe Kyrgyz and Thai government officials to purchase\ntobacco from their employer. The complaint alleged that,\namong other things, the individuals aided and abetted the\nissuer company’s violations of the books and records and\ninternal controls provisions by “knowingly provid[ing]\nsubstantial assistance to” the parent company.?! All four\nexecutives settled the charges against them, consenting to\nthe entry of final judgments permanently enjoining them\nfrom violating the accounting and anti-bribery provisions,\nwith two executives paying civil penalties.°? As in other\nareas of federal securities law, corporate officers also can be\nheld liable as control persons.?*\n\nSimilarly, in October 2011, SEC brought an admin-\nistrative action against a U.S. water valve manufacturer and\na former employee of the company’s Chinese subsidiary\nfor violations of the FCPA’ accounting provisions. The\nChinese subsidiary had made improper payments to employ-\nees of certain design institutes to create design specifications\nthat favored the company’s valve products. The payments\nwere disguised as sales commissions in the subsidiary’s books\nand records, thereby causing the US. issuer’s books and\nrecords to be inaccurate. The general manager of the subsid-\niary, who approved the payments and knew or should have\nknown that they were improperly recorded, was ordered to\ncease-and-desist from committing or causing violations of\nthe accounting provisions, among other charges.”\n\nAdditionally, individuals and entities can be held\ndirectly civilly liable for falsifying an issuer's books and\nrecords or for circumventing internal controls. Exchange\nAct Rule 13b2-1 provides: “No person shall, directly or\nindirectly, falsify or cause to be falsified, any book, record\nor account subject to [the books and records provision] of\n\nthe Securities Exchange Act.”?* And Section 13(b)(5) of\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_022545\n\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

Rev. 835, *888\n\nIn its current form, Rule 32(c)(1)(B) suggests that the probation officer is required to include restitution information only in a\ncase covered by the MVRA because only then is restitution (in the language of the current rule) \"required.\" 22° No sound\nreason exists [*889] for such a limitation, particularly after the enactment of the CVRA. The CVRA guarantees that victims\nhave \"the right to full and timely restitution as provided in law.\" *2? Even when the court is proceeding under the discretionary\nVWPA, without appropriate information in the presentence report, the court cannot determine whether to exercise its discretion\nto award restitution. Therefore, the rule should be changed to require that the presentence report contain restitution information,\nfrom which the court can determine whether to make a restitution award.\n\n(New) Rule 32(c)(3) - Probation Officer To Seek Out Victim Information\nThe Proposal:\n\nThe probation officer preparing a presentence report should be directed to determine whether a victim wishes to provide\ninformation for the report as follows:\n\n(3) Victim Information. The probation officer must determine whether any victim wishes to provide information for the\npresentence report.\n\nThe Rationale:\n\nUnder the CVRA, the victim has \"the right to be reasonably heard at any public proceeding in the district court involving ...\nsentencing ... .\". 72° This right clearly encompasses the victim's right to allocate, or make an oral statement at sentencing, as\ndiscussed below in connection with Rule 32(i). 73! However, the right to be \"reasonably heard\" also appears to include the\nopportunity to provide information to the probation office during preparation of the presentence report.\n\nAs Senator Kyl explained, the victim's right to be heard at sentencing should be broadly construed:\n[*890]\n\n[The CVRA] provides victims the right to reasonably be heard at any public proceeding involving ... sentencing. This provision\nis intended to allow crime victims to directly address the court in person. It is not necessary for the victim to obtain the\npermission of either party to do so ... . When a victim invokes this right during ... sentencing proceedings, it is mtended that ...\nhe or she be allowed to provide all three types of victim impact: the character of the victim, the impact of the crime on the\nvictim, the victims’ family and the community, and sentencing recommendations ... .\n\nIt is not the intent of the term \"reasonably\" in the phrase \"to be reasonably heard\" to provide any excuse for denying a victim\nthe right to appear in person and directly address the court. Indeed, the very purpose of this section is to allow the victim to\nappear personally and directly address the court. This section would fail in its intent if courts determined that written, rather\nthan oral communication, could generally satisfy this right. On the other hand, the term \"reasonably\" is meant to allow for\nalternative methods of communicating a victim's views to the court when the victim is unable to attend the proceedings. Such\ncircumstances might arise, for example, if the victim is incarcerated on unrelated matters at the time of the proceedings or if a\nvictim cannot afford to travel to a courthouse. In such cases, communication by the victim to the court is permitted by other\nreasonable means. 777\n\nIn light of this legislative history, victims undoubtedly have a right to make an in-court statement at sentencing as part of their\nright \"to be heard.\" But they also have the right to communicate in other ways with the court.

It\nwas,an implacable temple of the high-priests of hub-and-spoke network design.\nThat one building handled more telephone and telex traffic than nearly any other\nsingle point on earth. Surely the place was very high on the USSR first-strike list for\nexactly that reason. So Baran expected a friendly reception. After all, he’d be telling a\nbunch of men with a uranium death sentence that he’d found a way to get them off\nthe Soviet target list. His new “mesh” network would mean that bombing AT&T\nwould be largely pointless. It wouldn’t blind US commanders. If only they’d redesign\ntheir network, the AT&T engineers might save their own lives. They thought he was\ninsane.\n\n“I tried to explain packet switching to a senior telephone company executive. In mid-\nsentence he interrupted me, “ Baran recalled. “The old analog engineer looked\nstunned. He looked at his colleagues in the room while his eyeballs rolled up,\nsending a signal of his utter disbelief. He paused for a while, and then said, ‘Son,\nhere’s how a telephone works...” Of course Paul Baran knew how a telephone\nworked. You jacked one point to a switch to another point. That was the problem.\nThis was why AT&Ts design would be absolutely useless in the face of the\ncatastrophe he’d been told to prevent. Baran was, nerve and blood and bone, as an\nanalyst, and even as a refugee perhaps, alive with the imperative of survivability, of\nhow connection might mean the difference between war and peace. Those morons\nin the AT&T building? What the hell could they be worrying about?\n\nBut it wasn’t just that $2 billion annual check from the US Defense Department those\nwizened phone wizards were seeing vanish in Baran’s fishnet, it was a whole way of\nthinking. The AT&T scientists wanted to control the addresses, the routes, the\ntiming of messages from the center. This sort of authoritarian design appeared more\nefficient to them; perhaps it was even more psychologically comfortable since it\nmatched their own experience of being commanded and controlled. Kar] Wittfogel,\nthe historian who identified the water totalitarians of ancient China or Egypt, would\nhave recognized them: Switch Despots! “We had arrived at a conceptual impasse,”\nBaran reflected with the mild confidence of a man who knows he will eventually\n\n81\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_018313\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

Many computers were used as these computations would\ntake many years on a single ordinary computer.\n\nNote that the ability to study the frequency of words or phrases in English over time was our primary focus\nin this study. As such, we went to significant lengths to ensure the quality of the general English corpora\nand their date metadata (i.e., Eng-all, Eng-1M, and Eng-Modern-1M). As a result, the accuracy of place-\nof-publication data in English is not as reliable as the accuracy of date metadata. In addition, the foreign\nlanguage corpora are affected by issues that were improved and largely eliminated in the English data.\nFor instance, their date metadata is not as accurate. In the case of Hebrew, the metadata for language is\nan oversimplification: a significant fraction of the earliest texts annotated as Hebrew are in fact hybrids\nformed from Hebrew and Aramaic, the latter written in Hebrew script.\n\nThe size of these base corpora is described in Tables S3-S6.\n\nIII. Culturomic Analyses\n\nIn this section we describe the computational techniques we use to analyze the historical n-grams\ncorpora.\n\nIlI.0. General Remarks\n\nIII.0.1 On Corpora.\n\nThere is significant variation in the quality of the various corpora during various time periods and their\nsuitability for culturomic research. All the corpora are adequate for the uses to which they are put in the\npaper. In particular, the primary object of study in this paper is the English language from 1800-2000; this\ncorpus during this period is therefore the most carefully curated of the datasets. However, to encourage\nfurther research, we are releasing all available datasets - far more data than was used in the paper. We\ntherefore take a moment to describe the factors a culturomic researcher ought to consider before relying\non results of new queries not highlighted in the paper.\n\n1) Volume of data sampled. Where the number of books used to count n-gram frequencies is too small,\nthe signal to noise ratio declines to the point where reliable trends cannot be discerned. For instance, if\nan n-gram's actual frequency is 1 part in n, the number of words required to create a single reliable\ntimepoint must be some multiple of n. In the English language, for instance, we restrict our study to years\npast 1800, where at least 40 million words are found each year. Thus an n-gram whose frequency is 1\npart per million can be reliably quantified with single-year resolution. In Chinese, there are fewer than 10\nmillion words per year prior to the year 1956. Thus the Chinese corpus in 1956 is not in general as\nsuitable for reliable quantification as the English corpus in 1800. (In some cases, reducing the resolution\nby binning in larger windows can be used to sample lower frequency n-grams in a corpus that is too smal\nfor single-year resolution.) In sum: for any corpus and any n-gram in any year, one must consider whether\nthe size of the corpus is sufficient to enable reliable quantitation of that n-gram in that year.\n\n2) Composition of the corpus. The full dataset contains about 4% of all books ever published, which\nlimits the extent to which it may be biased relative to the ensemble of all surviving books. Still, marked\nshifts in composition from one year to another are a potential source of error. For instance, book sampling\npatterns differ for the period before the creation of Google Books (2004) as compared to the period\nafterward. Thus, it is difficult to compare results from after 2000 with results from before 2000. As a result,\nsignificant changes in culturomic trends past the year 2000 may reflect corous composition issues. This\nwas an important reason for our choice of the period between 1800 and 2000 as the target period.\n\n12\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_017020\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

That\nwork suggests that there is a\npsychological capacity that makes the\nprocess of knowing this kind of God\neasier, though its absence does not\nprevent religious experience, and its\npresence does not predict it. It is the\ncapacity for absorption, which is at the\nheart of imagination. Absorption is the\ncapacity to focus one’s attention on a\nnon-instrumental (and often internal)\nobject while disattending to everyday\nexterior surrounds. Absorption is related\nto hypnosis and dissociation, but not\nidentical to either. All of us go into light\nabsorption states when we settle into a\nbook and let the story carry us away.\nThere are no known physiological\nmarkers of an absorption state, but as the\nabsorption grows deeper, the person\nbecomes more difficult to distract, and\nhis sense of time and agency begins to\nshift. He lives within his imagination\nmore, whether that be simple\nmindfulness or elaborate fantasy, and he\nfeels that the experience happens to him,\nthat he is a bystander to his own\nawareness, more himself than ever\nbefore, or perhaps absent, but in any\ncase different. And as the absorption\ngrows deeper, people often experience\nmore imagery and more sensory\nphenomena, sometimes with\nhallucinatory vividness. Scholars do not\ndiscuss training in absorption, although\nresearchers of hypnosis and dissociation\n\n117\n\nPage\n\nare clear that some kind of practice\neffects can be seen. °\n\nConclusion\n\nPrayer is basically training in\nabsorption, at least the kind of prayer in\nwhich the person praying focuses\ninwardly and disattends to the everyday\nworld in order to engage with God. It\nwould be hard to over-estimate the\nimportance placed on prayer and prayer\nexperience in a church like this and\nindeed, in Christian America today.\nMany of the best-selling Christian books\nare books on prayer technique, and they\nsell in the millions. Such books often\nbegin by presenting the concrete sensory\nexperience of God described in the\nHebrew Bible as the everyday\nrelationship for which the ordinary\nbeliever should strive. In these manuals,\nthe act of praying is understood as a skill\nthat has to be deliberately learned. I\ndiscovered that these evangelical\ncongregants assumed that prayer was a\nskill which had to be taught, that it was\nhard, that not everyone was good at it,\nand that those who were naturally good\nand well trained would experience\nchanges associated with a more richly\ndeveloped inner world. Their mental\nimages would seem sharper; they would\nbe more likely to report unusual sensory\nexperiences. They would be more able,\nin short, to experience God. The more\nquantitative work—done in\ncollaboration with Howard Nusbaum\nand Ron Thisted--suggests that those\nwho have a proclivity for absorption and\nwho trained that proclivity through\nprayer are indeed more able to\naccomplish the demanding learning that\nthis concept of God sets out.* They are\nmore able to identify God’s presence in\ntheir mind.

At one point in its history, Haiti\nwas a market leader in the textile industry supplying quality products. Currently there is an\nopportunity to provide sustainable employment for Haitians with the right training to develop an\nindustry to serve as a catalyst to catapult the country out of the stigmatism of a third world country.\n‘There is a need for work to be done, such as construction of homes, infrastructure, etc.\n\nHaiti is one of the lowest-income countries in the Western hemisphere. The country has problems\nwith AIDS, crime, drug trafficking, etc. (CIA, 2010). On January 12th, 2010, an earthquake\ndestroyed the capital of the country and worsened the overall situation of Haiti. The total loss was\nestimated around $11.5 billion; however, the country still needs more time to rebuild (U.S.\nDepartment of State, 2010). The majority of the donor countries worry about Haiti becoming a\nburden throughout the years without any positive results (Novacek et. al, 2008). The country has\nboth positive and negative sides.\n\nThis business plan includes secondary data. Secondary data was selected from academic,\ngovernment, news resources or based on extensive research by those with experience in dealing\nwith Haiti.

The Seventh Sense is defined first by an intuitive feeling for just how power is\nbeing re-geared now. If you look at a kid with a phone and think “Strong”, you have\nthe Seventh Sense. If you look at an angry, barely educated terrorist wannabe and\nthink, “Junior Varsity”, you don't. And as a result you may be about to have a very\nunpleasant surprise.\n\nTry this: Ball up your right hand and hold it in front of you; now take your left hand\nand open the fingers and hold it a few inches away with your fingers pointing back\ntowards the right. You can think of your left hand as the vibrating, living network of\nconnection — reaching towards the concentrated power that your right hand\nrepresents. This is the heart of understanding our age. Networks live in that tension\nbetween distribution and concentration. To connect any object - my dad, a\nnewspaper, a radio-controlled plastic drone - to this skein is to change, irrevocably,\nits essence. The reason the legitimacy of old leaders is failing, the reason our\nstrategy is incoherent, the reason our age really is revolutionary, is that they are all\nsitting in the midst of these pulling, powerful forces. We should steel ourselves for\nthe shredding imminence of this violence . But also - and you know this already, |\nthink - we must prepare ourselves for the possibility of immense construction.\nNetwork power does not only pull apart. It also creates.\n\nThis paradox confused me, to be honest, for a long time. Power is, manifestly,\nconcentrated with astonishing efficiency now. And it is more widely dispersed than\never too. We can stare at this difference, this strange polar tension and baffle\nourselves as we try to figure out just how and why it moves. The best way of\nunderstanding this, I finally concluded, requires a cognitive leap, perhaps, over our\nusual Western way of understanding the world as either “a” or “b”, as either\n“distributed” or “concentrated”, and into a view of how opposites might ceaselessly\n\nbalance into a whole. Not “a” or “b” but “a” and “b” at the same time.\n\nLet me tell you what I mean: In 1132 the Song Dynasty that had ruled China for\nnearly 200 years collapsed in the face of an invasion by wild Manchurian soldiers\nfrom the northern plains. The Song leadership - along with its best minds and\ncultural figures - fled south from Beijing for a thousand miles, until they were safely\non the opposite bank of the Yangtze River. They settled in a lakeside city we know\ntoday as Hangzhou. In those days Hangzhou was known as Lin’An, which might best\nbe translated as “Gazing at Peace.” The little town must have seemed to the Song\nleaders a perfect respite from the horror and war they had left behind. The city lay\nthen, as it still does, along side XiHu or West Lake, a tranquil and horizon-filling\nstretch of water framed by rolling hills and tea plantations. The famous poet and\nstatesman Su Dongpo later compared gazing at the lake to looking at a beautiful\nwoman - that same fused sense of calm, peace and astonishment you might feel\nwhile considering the object of your own love. Stilled water is regarded in Chinese\nculture - you may recall from Lake Tai Hu where Master Nan set his campus —as a\nreservoir of yin energy. Song leaders had fled the angry yang energy of invasion for\nthe yin peace of the south. Yin energy is associated with calm, femininity, fertility.\nYang expresses action, violence, creation. Yang is the thunderstorm; Yin is the peace\n\n75\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_018307\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

Such legacies, and all the many other ways in which people achieve cultural immortality,\nfall beyond the scope of this initial examination.\n\nIII.8. History of Technology\n\nA list of inventions from 1800-1960 was taken from Wikipedia (Ref $10).\n\nThe year listed is used in our analysis. Where multiple listings of a particular invention appear, the year\nretained in the list is the one reported in the main Wikipedia article for the invention. (e.g. \"Microwave\nOven\" is listed in 1945 and 1946; the main article lists 1945 as the year of invention, and this is the year\nwe use in our analyses).\n\nEach entry's main Wikipedia page was checked for alternate terms for the invention. Where alternate\nnames were listed in the main article (e.g. thiamine or thiamin or vitamin B,), all the terms were\ncompared for their presence in the database. Where there was no single dominant term (e.g.MSG or\nmonosodium glutamate) the invention was eliminated from the list. If a name other than the originally\nlisted one appears to be dominant, the dominant name was used in the analysis (e.g.\nelectroencephalograph and EEG - EEG is used).\n\nInventions were grouped into 40-year intervals (1800-1840, 1840-1880, 1880-1920, and 1920-1960), and\nthe median percentages of peak frequency was calculated for each bin for each year following invention:\nthese were plotted in Fig 4B, together with examples of individual inventions in inset.\n\nOur study of the history of technology suffers from a possible sampling bias: it is possible that some older\ninventions, which peaked shortly after their invention, are by now forgotten and not listed in the Wikipedia\narticle at all. This sampling bias would be more extreme for the earlier cohorts, and would therefore tend\nto exaggerate the lag between invention date and cultural impact in the older invention cohorts. We have\nverified that our inventions are past their peaks, in all three cohorts (Fig $16). Future analyses would\nbenefit from the use of historical invention lists to control for this effect.\n\nAnother possible bias is that observing inventions later after they were invented leaves more room for the\nfame of these inventions to rise. To ensure that the effect we observe is not biased in this way, we\nreproduce the analysis done in the paper using constant time intervals: a hundred years from time of\ninvention. Because we have a narrower timespan, we consider only technologies invented in the 49\"\ncentury; and we group them in only two cohorts. The effect is consistent with that observed in the main\ntext (Fig S16).\n\nIII.9. Censorship\n\nIII.9A. Comparing the influence of censorship and propaganda on\nvarious groups\n\nTo create panel E of Fig 6, we analyzed a series of cohorts; for each cohort, we display the mean of the\nnormalized probability mass functions of the cohort, as described in section 1B. We multiplied the result\nby 100 in order to represent the probability mass functions more intuitively, as a percentage of lifetime\n\n26\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_017034\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

Sponsored by the Zabludowicz Collection, it features 20 up-\nand-coming galleries from all over the world. Whitechapel Gallery is also making some noise on the periphery,\ndisplaying works from the D.Daskalopoulos collection in Greece — one of the foremost collections of\ncontemporary art in Europe.\n\nSyma Tariq, art editor\n\n36\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_028316\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

A 1979\npopulation-based study showed that\nadults lacking social ties were 1.9 to 3.1\ntimes more likely to die during a 9-year\nfollow-up than those who had more\nsocial contacts, all else being equal (2).\nSince then, at least five population-based\nprospective studies (3) and numerous\nsmaller studies have found positive\nassociations between social integration\nand either survival or improved health\noutcomes. The mechanisms by which\nsocial integration enhances survival are\nseveral and include improved health\nbehaviors, increased access to resources\nand material goods, and strengthened\nimmunity against infection (4).\n\nWhereas sociality is a normal\nstate, loneliness is an unusual state, akin\nto hunger, thirst, or pain (5). As with\nthose states, loneliness is unpleasant and\nserves to remind us that we should\nchange the status quo. Therefore,\nloneliness can be an adaptive motivator\nfor increased social surveillance and\ninteraction. Unfortunately, not all\nindividuals succeed at achieving the\nlevel of social connectedness they desire\nand suffer instead from chronic feelings\nof loneliness. Cacioppo and others have\nshown that lonely individuals interpret\nevents and social interactions more\nnegatively than non-lonely individuals.\nAs aresult, they unconsciously develop\ndefense mechanisms, including social\nbarriers, which shield them from insults\nand rejection. While this approach may\nachieve its goals of self-protection, it\nalso reduces opportunities for positive\nsocial interactions and perpetuates\nfeelings of social isolation (5). John\nBunyan, a 17” century Christian writer\nand preacher, described the barriers\nassociated with loneliness when he\nwrote of a vision in which he\n\n131\n\nPage\n\n“saw the people set on the sunny\nside of some high mountain,\nthere refreshing themselves with\nthe pleasant beams of the sun,\nwhile I was shivering and\nshrinking in the cold, afflicted\nwith frost, snow, and dark\nclouds. Methought, also, betwixt\nme and them, I saw a wall that\n\ndid compass about this mountain\n\n(6).”\n\nFor chronically lonely people,\nthe wall between themselves and others\nis partly of their own making and\nreflects continuous surveillance for\nnegative signals from others (5). The\nchallenge is to help lonely individuals\nbreak down the barriers between\nthemselves and others and ultimately\nreturn to the normal state of sociality. In\nhis vision, Bunyan achieved this, but\nonly through great effort:\n\n“About this wall I thought\nmyself, to go again and again,\nstill prying as I went, to see if I\ncould find some way or passage,\nby which I might enter therein,\nbut none could I find for some\ntime. At the last, I saw, as it\nwere, a narrow gap, like a little\ndoorway in the wall, through\nwhich I attempted to pass; but the\npassage being very strait and\nnarrow, I made many efforts to\nget in, but all in vain, even until I\nwas well-nigh quite beat out, by\nstriving to get in; at last, with\ngreat striving, methought I at first\ndid get in my head, and after that,\nby a sidling striving, my\nshoulders, and my whole body;\nthen I was exceeding glad, and\nwent and sat down in the midst\nof them, and so was comforted\nwith the light and heat of their\nsun (6).”\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_021377\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

This photo was not made available to the Australian National University, although it was requested\nin the course of the investigation.”\n\n(And for the record | often put my hand up in front of a camera if there is a flash, as | specifically request selfies not to include flashes,\nso that | don’t end up with a series bright spots in front of my eyes for the next half hour)\n\nWhat makes this particular type of allegation so repugnant is that | get asked for literally thousands of selfies, and when people come\nup to me they are vulnerable, often shaking, and sometimes overly aggressive. | am particularly proud of the way | attempt to make all\npeople feel at ease, and respected, rather than humiliated. Thus, this false claim strikes at the heart of what | am about, which is to\nacknowledge fans in a way that makes them feel appreciated. As | understand you had a reporter watching me sign books and take\nselfies at the CFl conference in Las Vegas this year, that behavior is what they will have witnessed. Moreover, | am proud of the\ninteractions | have had at both Case and ASU, with students, colleagues and staff. | have had numerous female graduate students,\npostdocs, employees, and colleagues, and as ASU attested to you, none of these have ever complained of harassment. Quite the\ncontrary in fact, as | have worked hard to support them, mentor them, and treat them with respect. | treat others as responsible adults,\nand | expect to be treated equally.\n\nBegin forwarded message:\n\nFrom: Peter Aldhous Iii\n\nSubject: URGENT: BuzzFeed News inquiry re allegations of sexual harassment\nDate: December 10, 2017 at 5:12:27 PM PST\n\n1 a\n\nDr. Krauss:\n\nAs you know, I’m a reporter for BuzzFeed News who has been investigating sexual misconduct allegations\nagainst you.

Palin was\nasked about her readiness for the office of vice president, which isn’t\nmuch of an office really. What was really being asked was her readi-\nness for the presidency, which was not unreasonable to worry about\nconsidering John McCain’s age. She responded in a way that made\nclear that she has no understanding of causation either.\n\nIn the statements above, she asserted (implicitly) the following\nbeliefs about causation:\n\nAny mayor or city manager is ready to be president.\n\nAny governor is ready to be president.\n\nAny commissioner is ready to be president.\n\nAny regulator of gas and oil is ready to be president.\n\nIf you have a vision of energy independence, you are ready to be\npresident.\n\nNow, of course, one of these beliefs is, in fact, shared by the country\nsince we have chosen governors to be president.

I think it did\nme a world of good. But here are my five biggest problems with the way I learned\nabout sexuality:\n\n1. L wish that I hadn't gotten this message: \"Sex is easy, light-hearted -- and if it's not,\nyou're doing it wrong.\"\n\nDo I believe sex can be easy? Sure. Do I think it can be light-hearted? Absolutely! But do\nI think it's always those things? No, and I don't think it \"ought to” be.\n\nI think we need to teach that sex can be incredibly difficult. It can be hard to\ncommunicate with your partner. It can be hard to learn and come to terms with your own\nsexual desires. It can be hard to understand or accept all your partner's sexual desires.\nAnd just because it's hard, doesn't mean that you're with the wrong partner -- or that\nyou're missing some vital piece of information that everyone else has -- or that you're\ndoing it wrong.\n\nAnd as for light-hearted, well -- sure, sex can be \"happy rainbows joy joy!\", but it can\nalso be serious... or dark. And there's nothing wrong with that!\n\nI recently talked to a friend, who also identifies as a BDSMer, about our stories of\ncoming into BDSM. Both of us had sadomasochistic fantasies from a very early age\n(mine, for instance, started in grade school -- seriously, I actually did tie up my Barbie\ndolls). I told my friend about how I'd always had these intense, dark, violent feelings --\nbut when I made it to middle school, I remember a change. I had a series of vivid BDSM-\nish dreams, and I freaked out. I closed it all away, I stopped thinking about it, I repressed\nit all as savagely as I could.\n\nBefore that, I had also started thinking about sex. I imagined sex at great length; I read\nabout sex. I had long since filched my parents’ copy of The Joy of Sex and examined it,\ncover to cover -- not to mention many other fine sexuality works, like Nancy Friday's\ncompilation of female sexual fantasies My Secret Garden. I was totally fascinated by sex.\nI talked about it so much that one of my friends specifically searched out a vibrator as a\nbirthday present for me. I actually pressured my first major boyfriend into some sexual\nacts before he was ready, which I suppose is an interesting reversal of stereotype (but to\nbe clear, it's not okay that I did that). As I started having sex, I found that I liked it okay,\nbut knew a lot was missing -- and couldn't figure out what.\n\nIt took me years and years to connect sex to BDSM -- to figure out that the biggest thing I\nwas missing was BDSM. Why? Because BDSM was horrible and wrong, and I'd shut it\naway; BDSM (I thought) couldn't possibly have anything to do with the bright, shiny,\nhappy horizon of sex! Coming into BDSM was a crisis for me partly because -- although\nI knew other people practiced it, and had never thought much about that -- my own need\nfor those dark feelings totally shocked me. This wasn't me. This wasn't healthy sex. Sex\nwas light-hearted, happy rainbows joy joy!... wasn't it?\n\nIn contrast, my friend -- who had an extremely sexually repressed upbringing -- never\nhad any trouble integrating BDSM into his sex life. Sex, for him, was already wrong and\nbad... so as he got in touch with his sexuality and began having sex, BDSM was involved\nfrom the start. After all, there was no reason for it not to be.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_018461\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

The rules could direct full disclosure of the presentence report to the victim. While no statute bars this\napproach, legitimate policy objections might be raised. Some reports may contain sensitive private information about the\ndefendant such as results of psychiatric examinations, prior history of drug use, or childhood sexual abuse. Some reports may\nalso reveal confidential law enforcement information that should not be widely circulated. Victims may not always need access\n\nrt, 269\n\nto these parts of the report. While a number of states give victims unfettered right to access the presentence repo a more\n\nlimited approach seems appropriate in the federal system.\n\n[*900] (2) Selective Disclosure. The rules could direct that the probation office redact any presentence report to remove\nconfidential information and then provide the redacted report to the victim. This approach, too, is problematic; it would require\nconsiderable work by busy probation officers to prepare an additional document - a redacted report - presumably only after\nconsulting with the attorneys on both sides of the case about what might be viewed as confidential.\n\n(3) Disclosure through Prosecutors. The simplest solution to the competing concerns is to disclose the report to victims through\nan intermediary: the prosecutor. The prosecutor would serve as the filter for confidential information and assist the victim by\nhighlighting critical parts of the report. Opponents might object that this approach would burden prosecutors, who are no less\n\n270\n\nbusy than probation officers. But the CVRA already gives victims the right to \"confer\" with prosecutors, and presumably\n\nthey will confer regarding the important topic of sentencing. Moreover, many U.S. Attorney's Offices already have Victim-\nWitness Coordinators who communicate with victims regarding impact statements. The CVRA also authorizes increased\n\nfunding of $ 22 million for the Victim-Witness Assistance Programs in U.S. Attorney's Offices, presumably enabling those\n\noffices to expand their victim services. 77!\n\nIt might be burdensome to require that prosecutors disclose presentence reports to victims in all cases, even when they are not\ninterested in such disclosure. Accordingly, disclosure of the report should be required only upon request of a victim.\n\nFor all those reasons, the Commission should amend the rules to give requesting victims access to presentence reports through\nthe prosecutor. In addition, some of the aspects of preparing and disclosing presentence reports are covered in Chapter 6.A of\nthe United States Sentencing Guidelines Manual. *’? The Manual falls within the jurisdiction of the U.S. Sentencing\nCommission. Accordingly, the Advisory Committee on Criminal Rules should [*901] coordinate with the Commission to\nensure that any changes in the Criminal Rules are consistent with the provisions of the Manual.\n\nRule 32(f), (h), (i) - Victim Opportunity To Object to Presentence Report\n\nThe Proposal:\n\nRule 32(f), (h), and (i) should be amended to allow the victim to object to the presentence report as follows:\n(f) Objecting to the Report.\n\n(1) Time To Object. Within 14 days after receiving the presentence report, the parties must state in writing any objections,\nincluding objections to material information, sentencing guideline ranges, and policy statements contained in or omitted from\nthe report. The attorney for the government or for the victim shall raise for the victim any reasonable objection by the victim to\nthe presentence report.\n\n269 See supra note 255.\n\n270 18 U.S.C.A. 3771(a)(5) (West 2004 & Supp. 2005).\n271 See 118 Stat. 2260, 2264 (2004).\n\n272 See supra note 257 and accompanying text.\n\nDAVID SCHOEN\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_017752\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

Mill writes:\n\nIf ever any one, possessed of power, had grounds for thinking himself\nthe best and most enlightened among his contemporaries, it was the\nEmperor Marcus Aurelius. Absolute monarch of the whole civilized\nworld, he preserved through life not only the most unblemished\njustice, but what was less to be expected from his Stoical breeding,\nthe tenderest heart. The few failings which are attributed to him, were\nall on the side of indulgence: while his writings, the highest ethical\nproduct of the ancient mind, differ scarcely perceptibly, if they differ\nat all, from the most characteristic teachings of Christ. And yet, as\nMill laments, this “unfettered intellect,” this exemplar of humanism\nby second-century-AD standards, persecuted Christians. As\ndeplorable a state as society was in at the time (wars, internal revolts,\ncruelty in all its manifestations), Marcus Aurelius assumed that what\nheld it together and kept it from getting worse was the acceptance of\nthe existing divinities, which the adherents of Christianity threatened\nto dissolve. He simply could not foresee a world knit together by new\nand better ties. “No Christian,” Mill writes, “more firmly believes\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_032192\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

Consumer comeback\n\nHouseholds have been the noticeable laggard in the current recovery and the main\nreason why Japan’s economy has barely grown since the 2014 consumption tax hike.\nThis is not for a lack of income growth: real employee compensation (wages +\nemployment) has staged an impressive recovery of late, rising 1.2% in CY15, and an\nestimated 1.9% in CY16 (Chart 13).\n\nOne explanation is that private consumption is simply being underestimated in demand-\nside GDP statistics: researchers at the Bank of Japan recently produced experimental\nsupply-side estimates of GDP that were significantly higher than existing expenditure-\nside statistics. We find the Bo) research interesting and agree that Japanese\nconsumption statistics are beset by data quality issues. But this alone cannot account\nfor the consumption slump. We think two factors are equally to blame for depressed\nhousehold spending: 1) a squeeze on disposable income from higher taxes and social\nsecurity contributions; and 2) a surge in the saving rate (Chart 14).\n\nCalling Japan right in 2017 is largely about correctly forecasting whether these two\ntrends will reverse. We see several reasons for optimism. First, we expect real employee\ncompensation to accelerate further, driven by a continued pick-up in per capita wages.\nThe call on the saving rate is admittedly trickier. But having surpassed the 2006 highs,\nwe think it is unlikely to surge further, given that consumer confidence is improving and\nincome growth is firming. FY17 tax reforms are also likely to support household\nsentiment at the margin: for example, discussions are underway about enlarging tax cuts\nfor second-earners who work part-time. Overall, we expect private consumption to rise\n1.0% in CY17, adding O.6ppt to growth.\n\nShould the saving rate stabilize, as we expect, consumption should again start rising in\ntandem with compensation. Investors should not have to wait long to get some visibility\naround these trends. We expect the saving rate to peak in Q4 CY16 and consumption to\nrise strongly from this quarter.\n\n?

He says American conservatives abandoned the middle ground\nrepresented by Republican presidents such as Dwight D. Eisenhower, Richard Nixon and\nBush Sr and became radicals. The derailment, he argues, began under Ronald Reagan\nand reached its zenith under George W. Bush.\n\nWith the goodwill gone the US \"is not able to produce a medium-term credible fiscal\ntrajectory or get agreement on rebuilding its infrastructure\". This paralysis \"is significant\nnot just for the US but for the world.\"\n\nKeating links the collapse of this \"prosperity compact\" to the financial crisis. Too many\nAmericans were unable to sustain themselves from wages and salaries.\n\nHow did they get by? They used the easy credit of the banking system, thereby feeding\nthe frenzy that ended in bad loans and meltdown.\n\nKeating's book has an abiding message for Australia: in the transformed world we \"will\nfind ourselves increasingly on our own\" having to master our own destiny.\n\nThe job is to rediscover the productivity and savings agenda of the 1990s. Why did\nAustralia survive the 2008 financial crisis? \"Because of the flexibility of the economy,\"\nKeating says. \"Flexibility which came from the reform of Australia's financial, product and\nlabour markets that began 25 years ago. This has given us one of the most flexible\neconomies in the world - arguably the most flexible. But further structural changes are\nahead of us.\"\n\nHe lists them. It is a mix of the new and old Keating agenda: a shift in resources to the\nextractive industries; a lift in capital inflow driving a high current account deficit putting a\npremium on savings; recognition that competitiveness will lie \"in the creativity of our\npeople as much as it does in our oil and gas\"; a renewed emphasis on the value of hi-\ntech and education; and above all, a cultural change that integrates Australia more into\nEast Asia. \"Cultural transformation is the key for us,\" Keating says. He rates it as more\nimportant than economic reform.\n\n“There is less interest now in being part of East Asia than there was in the 1990s,\" he\nlaments.\n\nKeating wants this idea revived. And he ties it to the republic arguing that to succeed in\nAsia we must become a republic, a proposition Howard always dismissed.\n\nOn China, Keating is an optimist yet alive to the daunting economic challenge China now\nconfronts. \"What is happening in China knows no precedence in world economic history,\"\nhe says. \"Never before have 1.25 billion people dragged themselves from poverty at such\na pace. China is now half the GDP of the US and incomes have risen by a factor of 10.\"\nHe argues, however, that the origin of the 2008 financial crisis lies in the global\nimbalances - China has built huge foreign exchange reserves by exporting too much and\nAmerica, in turn, is saving too little.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_029676\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

On the other hand if the\nreader rejects one or more of these claims, they may find one or more aspects of CogPrime\nunacceptable for some reason.\n\nWithout further ado, now, the claims:\n\n1. General intelligence (at the human level and ultimately beyond) can be achieved via creating\na computational system that seeks to achieve its goals, via using perception and memory\nto predict which actions will achieve its goals in the contexts in which it finds itself.\n\n2. To achieve general intelligence in the context of human-intelligence-friendly environments\nand goals using feasible computational resources, it’s important that an AGI system can\nhandle different kinds of memory (declarative, procedural, episodic, sensory, intentional,\nattentional) in customized but interoperable ways.\n\n3. Cognitive synergy: It’s important that the cognitive processes associated with different kinds\nof memory can appeal to each other for assistance in overcoming bottlenecks in a manner\nthat enables each cognitive process to act in a manner that is sensitive to the particularities\nof each others’ internal representations, and that doesn’t impose unreasonable delays on\nthe overall cognitive dynamics.\n\n4, As a general principle, neither purely localized nor purely global memory is sufficient for\ngeneral intelligence under feasible computational resources; “glocal” memory will be re-\nquired.\n\n5. To achieve human-like general intelligence, it’s important for an intelligent agent to have\nsensory data and motoric affordances that roughly emulate those available to humans.\nWe don’t know exactly how close this emulation needs to be, which means that our AGI\nsystems and platforms need to support fairly flexible experimentation with virtual-world\nand/or robotic infrastructures.\n\n6. To work toward adult human-level, roughly human-like general intelligence, one fairly easily\ncomprehensible path is to use environments and goals reminiscent of human childhood, and\nseek to advance one’s AGI system along a path roughly comparable to that followed by\nhuman children.\n\n7. It is most effective to teach an AGI system aimed at roughly human-like general intelli-\ngence via a mix of spontaneous learning and explicit instruction, and to instruct it via a\ncombination of imitation, reinforcement and correction, and a combination of linguistic and\nnonlinguistic instruction.\n\n8. One effective approach to teaching an AGI system human language is to supply it with\nsome in-built linguistic facility, in the form of rule-based and statistical-linguistics-based\nNLP systems, and then allow it to improve and revise this facility based on experience.\n\n9. An AGI system with adequate mechanisms for handling the key types of knowledge men-\ntioned above, and the capability to explicitly recognize large-scale patterns in itself, should,\nupon sustained interaction with an appropriate environment in pursuit of ap-\npropriate goals, emerge a variety of complex structures in its internal knowledge network,\nincluding, but not limited to:\n\ne a hierarchical network, representing both a spatiotemporal hierarchy and an approxi-\nmate “default inheritance” hierarchy, cross-linked\n\ne a heterarchical network of associativity, roughly aligned with the hierarchical network\n\ne aself network which is an approximate micro image of the whole network\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_012930\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

Almost exactly 100 years earlier, China’s “May Fourth Movement”\nof 1919 was a direct response to the actions of President Woodrow Wilson at the end of World War\nI. Wilson had promised China, an American ally, that German colonies in Shandong would be\nreturned to Chinese sovereignty, but instead handed them to Japan. China exploded with anti-\nAmerican, nationalist sentiment. One of the eventual consequences was the establishment of the\nChinese Communist Party, which for the last 70 years has ruled the country.\nThus, Mr. Trump has handed Xi Jinping a remarkably effective nationalist card to play at a time\nwhen he has been under pressure at home because of a slowing economy. The Chinese media is\nnow full of accounts of the country’s economic resilience and appeals to patriotism, even invoking\nthe spirit of the Korean War, when, according to the official narrative, China was able to stare\ndown the vastly superior American military.\nAnd just in case people didn’t get the point, Mr. Xi recently visited Jiangxi, the starting point of\nthe Long March in 1934, in which the Communist Party endured many hardships but ultimately\nemerged victorious.\nI can almost hear members of the Trump administration groaning. Why on earth would they need\nto take into consideration events in China’s ancient past?\nThe answer depends on what Mr. Trump’s primary objective is. If it’s to sound tough to American\nvoters, he may well have a winning formula. But if it’s to bring about a substantive change in\nChina’s negotiating posture toward a bilateral trade agreement, one that might usher in changes\nin China’s trade policy, addressing questions of forced technology transfers, intellectual property\ntheft, industrial subsidies, currency manipulation and a phalanx of other non-tariff barriers, I’m\nnot so sure.\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/29/opinion/trump-china-trade-war.html 1/3\n5/29/2019 Opinion | Trump Hands China an Easy Win in the Trade War - The New York Times\nDays after the president’s tweets, China listed three “red lines,” positions the United States had\ntaken in the trade talks that were unacceptable: First, that it would keep tariffs in place for a\nperiod after the proposed trade agreement was signed. Second, that it could impose punitive\ntariffs if it judged China to be in violation of the agreement, and that China would be forbidden\nfrom retaliating with its own tariffs. Third, the ever-inflating expectations of the terms under\nwhich Beijing would buy American goods under a proposed bilateral purchasing agreement.\nThese “red lines” were new. Before that, China’s negotiating team had a fully flexible remit from\nthe leadership. But not anymore. Now that these three lines are in the public domain, there is no\nway Chinese leaders can yield on them. The leaks of large parts of the negotiating text to the\nAmerican news media has added a new level of toxicity, making it virtually impossible to return\nto the existing text as a basis of negotiations. Together with recent moves against the Chinese\ntelecom company Huawei presumably intended to pressure Beijing further, the possibility of\nnegotiating a revised agreement that is more accommodating to American interests is now very\nslim.\nInstead, what I have seen in Beijing over the last few weeks is a country moving in exactly the\nopposite direction.\nRelated\nMore on the trade war.\nOpinion | Michelle Cottle\nDonald Trumpʼs Great Patriotic Wars May 26, 2019\nEconomic analysts, meanwhile, have been calculating the impact of a full-blown trade war,\nestimating a loss of about 1.2 percentage points to Chinese G.D.P. growth. This figure is now\nportrayed in the Chinese media as entirely manageable given China’s capacity to use fiscal and\nmonetary policy stimulus to support domestic demand and keep growth above 6 percent.\nEven if a trade deal with the United States is still possible, some in the Chinese leadership are\nnow starting to ask, why bother? They argue that in technology, investment, foreign policy,\nnational security and human rights, the Trump administration has made it clear that it has\nembarked on a more adversarial position toward China. So why should Beijing expend any more\npolitical capital on a trade deal? Perhaps it’s better, in China’s view, to cut its losses now and get\nready for the next Cold War.\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/29/opinion/trump-china-trade-war.html 2/3\n5/29/2019 Opinion | Trump Hands China an Easy Win in the Trade War - The New York Times\nIf that’s what the Trump administration wants, its strategy has been a great success. If not, and\nthe president really wants a trade deal, with reasonable decreases in the bilateral trade deficit,\nand some substantive changes in Chinese economic behavior, the American negotiating strategy\nrequires some serious recalibration.\nOf course, China’s public position is that negotiations can continue. Even within the framework of\nthe new “red lines,” there may still be room for a deal. China might agree to purchase more\nAmerican goods, with America yielding on the retention of tariffs, and the unilateral right to\nimpose tariffs later. However, the degree of difficulty in getting to an agreement has now\nincreased substantially.\nThe bottom line is that nationalism is not just a factor in Trump’s America. It’s now a big factor in\nXi Jinping’s China as well, reinforced through the prism of Chinese history. In most of its dealings\nwith America over the last 100 years, China has seen itself as weak. Today, in Beijing’s view,\nChina is weak no longer.\nKevin Rudd, a former prime minister of Australia, is president of the Asia Society Policy Institute in New York.\nThe Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

For years now it has been my dream to attend your\nMBA program, studying amongst the world’s best professors and most achieved students to earn the edu-\ncation that will influence the rest of my career and the future of my company. To explain how much | also\nhope to contribute at Harvard, | would like to tell you three stories that characterize who | am.\n\nMy first story is about family.\n\nA small-town Italian from a modest family, my father worked locally as an industrial designer after high school,\nbut he always wanted to be an entrepreneur. Thirty-four years ago, at the age of 22, as soon as he sawa\nmarket opportunity, he quit his job (defying his parents), linked his talents for design and sports, and hand-\nbuilt his first piece of gym equipment in his garage; that was the beginning of Technogym. By the time | arrived,\nseven years later, Technogym had earned a respected place in the international market. Nine years later,\nwhen my younger brother was born, it was the world-leading and most innovative manufacturer of fitness\nequipment, digital wellness solutions and rehabilitation systems. It now has annual revenues of over 555m€\nand 35 million daily users in over 100 countries. My father directs some 2,000 staff as CEO and Chairman.\nThousands of talented people have contributed to Technogym, among them my mother, my brother, and I.\nTechnogym has been like my older sibling, and has always been the main topic of conversation at dinner. We\nplan our vacations around it and have supported one another through its ups and downs. We have all made\nsacrifices — but gladly, as one always does for family.\n\nMy father’s vision to bring “wellness” to people around the world inspired me to get involved at a very young\nage, so many of my childhood memories involve weekends at the office with my dad. These early experiences\nembedded in me the entrepreneurial values that make my father such a successful person, values such as\ntaking calculated risks and investing in innovation. | have attended countless meetings at his side and worn a\ncompany T-shirt at every Olympics from Athens 2004 to Rio 2016, as Technogym has been the games’ official\nsupplier since 2000.\n\nGrowing up in a family business has given me access to a vast network of people and | have sought to learn\nas much as | could from inspiring people like Richard Branson and Marc Benioff; however, the person | admire\nthe most is my mother, who put aside her own education and career to commit to our family and company.\nShe’s been at my father’s side since she was 16. Women have played a huge role in business and society,\nand | want to do my part to further opportunities for women, joining the long legacy of leaders who proudly\ncall themselves Harvard alumnae. | intend to participate in the Women’s Student Association to become one\nof the voices that carries this power beyond the campus. A Harvard education will help me develop the vision,\nleadership and credibility that | will need throughout my career, and in furthering great causes that mean a lot\nto me.\n\nNext, I'd like to talk about commitment.\n\n| understood early that | would always participate with my father's legacy and lead Technogym. | committed\nmyself to learning languages at school, becoming a good teammate and competitor through sports, and\nspending my university holidays exploring different industries through internships. Yet | still wanted to set my\nown career and earn my own credibility. Whether conducting analyses at JP Morgan in Paris, selling high-\npriced artwork in Mexico City, or developing marketing campaigns for iconic brands like Bulgari and\nTifany&Co., | have built my own identity thanks to working alongside diverse, accomplished people. By\nadapting to different countries, cultures and industries, | have adopted new ways of thinking, working, and\neven speaking while also asserting myself and learning to make measurable contributions quickly.\n\nMy most impactful experience was volunteering for a UN’s World Food Program microfinance initiative in El\nSalvador, one of the world's poorest and most dangerous countries. | helped design and develop “Fondo\npara Agricultura,” an investment fund supporting 75,000 small farmers. There, | was warned not to walk\nalone or explore the city, but | have never seen such warm and generous people as the Salvadorans. | made\nlifelong friends with my colleagues and many locals, and | witnessed how even small efforts can impact the\nlives of many. | became active in our company’s foundation to spread goodwill in my own community.\nSince 2009, Technogym has been an invitee of the World Economic Forum in Davos as the ‘wellness indus-\ntry shaper’, a true honour for a company of its size.

Based on these formalisms, algorithms and structures, a number of \"single formal-\nism/algorithm focused\" AGI approaches have been outlined, some of which will be reviewed in\nChapter 4. For example Pei Wang’s NARS (\"Non-Axiomatic Reasoning System”) approach is\nbased on a specific logic which he argues to be the \"logic of general intelligence\" — so, while his\nsystem contains many other aspects than this logic, he considers this logic to be the crux of the\nsystem and the source of its potential power as an AGI system.\n\nThe basic intuition on the part of these \"single formalism/algorithm focused\" researchers\nseems to be that there is one key formalism or algorithm underlying intelligence, and if you\nachieve this key aspect in your AGI program, you're going to get something that fundamentally\nthinks like a person, even if it has some differences due to its different implementation and\nembodiment. On the other hand, it’s also possible that this idea is philosophically incorrect:\nthat there is no one key formalism, algorithm, structure or idea underlying general intelligence.\nThe CogPrime approach is based on the intuition that to achieve human-level, roughly human-\nlike general intelligence based on feasible computational resources, one needs an appropriate\nheterogeneous combination of algorithms and structures, each coping with different types of\nknowledge and different aspects of the problem of achieving goals in complex environments.\n\n1.6.7 Integrative Cognitive Architecture\n\nFinally, to create advanced AGI one can try to build some sort of integrative cognitive architec-\nture: a software system with multiple components that each carry out some cognitive function,\nand that connect together in a specific way to try to yield overall intelligence.\n\nCognitive science gives us some guidance about the overall architecture, and computer science\nand neuroscience give us a lot of ideas about what to put in the different components. But still\nthis approach is very complex and there is a lot of need for creative invention.\n\nThis is the approach we consider most “serious” at present (at least until neuroscience ad-\nvances further). And, as will be discussed in depth in these pages, this is the approach we’ve\nchosen: CogPrime is an integrative AGI architecture.\n\n1.6.8 Can Digital Computers Really Be Intelligent?\n\nAll the AGI approaches we’ve just mentioned assume that it’s possible to make AGI on digital\ncomputers. While we suspect this is correct, we must note that it isn’t proven.\n\nIt might be that — as Penrose [Pen96], Hameroff [Mam87] and others have argued — we need\nquantum computers or quantum gravity computers to make AGI. However, there is no evidence\nof this at this stage. Of course the brain like all matter is described by quantum mechanics,\nbut this doesn’t imply that the brain is a “macroscopic quantum system” in a strong sense\n(like, say, a Bose-Einstein condensate). And even if the brain does use quantum phenomena in\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_012924\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

This is not to say that the\nsubstantively irreligious lack proper\nmotivation to practice medicine. It is to\nsay that an animating vision for\nmedicine as a good and worthy activity\nseems to require moral concepts that\nscience alone does not provide.\n\nHow should medical science be\ndeployed?\n\nMedicine is not only animated by\nsomething like a religious vision; it also\nrequires a thick moral framework for its\nongoing direction. To know how best to\ncare for patients, we need to know\nsomething about what human flourishing\nentails and how medicine can contribute\nto it. Medical science is less helpful here\nthan one might hope.\n\nScience facilitates the sort of\nreligious humanism that Browning\nencourages, because it helps us better\nunderstand the empirical world and\ntherefore helps all moral communities\nrefine their efforts to bring about human\nflourishing. Science elucidates a range of\ntechnical possibilities and provides\ninformation about what we can\nreasonably expect as the consequence of\nchoosing one course over another. Yet,\neven the successes of medical science\nhighlight its limits. As medical science\ngenerates technologies that can be put to\never-wider uses, it exposes\ndisagreements about which of those uses\nare worthwhile. Although medicine\nproceeds in scientific ways in the care of\npatients, it does so in pursuit of goals\nthat science cannot set. These goals\ncome from moral traditions and cultures,\nreligious or otherwise.\n\nIn the same way that the\ninfluence of a dominant culture on\nmedical practice is often invisible or\n\n142\n\nPage\n\ntaken for granted precisely because of its\ndominance, so the influence of religious\nideas on medical practice is often\ninvisible in those areas where\ncommitments are shared in common\namong different religions and other\nmoral traditions. For example, we\ngenerally take it for granted that\nmending injuries, treating infections, and\nremoving diseased organs are good\nthings to do. That is because the moral\ncommitments that undergird these\npractices are shared by virtually all\nmoral communities, religious or\notherwise. Moral commitments that are\nshared by all may not seem ‘moral’ at\nall. Yet even the idea of sickness implies\na norm of and concern for health that are\nnot fully derivable from empirical\nscience.\n\nThe influence of religion on\nmedical practice becomes more visible\nwhere the commitments of particular\ntraditions diverge from one another or\nwhere they diverge from the values of\nthe dominant culture. For example,\nreligious measures have been found\nconsistently to strongly predict\nphysicians’ attitudes regarding ethically\ncontroversial practices such as abortion,\nphysician-assisted suicide, withdrawal of\nlife-sustaining therapies, contraception,\nphysician interaction with patients about\nspiritual concerns and, as we have found,\nphysicians’ ideas about the relationship\nbetween religion and health.’\n\nYet overtly controversial issues\nmerely highlight the tips of proverbial\nicebergs. Disputes about practices such\nas abortion or physician-assisted suicide\nconcern whether the practices are\nintrinsically unethical. Much more\ncommonly physicians agree about the\nrange of legitimate clinical strategies,\nbut they disagree about which is to be\nrecommended in a given moment.

The initial price strength\n—a simple catch up with Chinese prices triggered by a shift in demand expectations — is losing strength.\n¢ In order to continue the price rally, a firm increase in final metal demand is needed. Since global\neconomic growth is far from seeing such a demand uptick in industrial activity during 4Q12, we think that\nprices are likely to trade only sideways in the coming months before trending higher in 1Q13.\ne Loose monetary policy is a good precondition for activity to pick up, but not a guarantee after so many\nrounds of monetary stimulus. We therefore look east to China. Although industrial activity growth in China\nis likely to bottom out, the upcoming leadership change in the country (November 2012 to March 2013),\nwill likely delay a bigger investment program into 1Q13. The latest stimulus program will probably prevent\nChinese IP from decelerating even further, but will not lift it meaningfully higher.\n¢ Ona single commodity level, we favor copper and nickel. For nickel, short-term supply issues due to a\nslower ramp up of new and existing projects have temporarily brought the market closer to balance than\ninitially expected. Furthermore, we should see higher Chinese stainless steel demand with stabilizing\nhousing activity and a demand pick up in stainless steel related products.\n¢ With regards to copper, we expect import activity to remain strong, as seen in the import figures for\nSeptember. Overall, the copper market should remain undersupplied, which could widen if financial\ndemand is finding some store of value in the metal. We think this puts structurally low LME inventories at\nrisk and should push the metal price towards USD 8,800/mt or higher over six months.\n\n4 Positive scenario\n\n¢ China eases monetary policy aggressively, pushing credit growth to 20% y/y. In the US the Fed is able to\nlift GDP growth via QE3 and the ECB puts an effective backstop to declining industrial activity.\n\nSt Negative scenario\n\n¢ To passive Chinese authorities keep GDP growth on a constant deceleration path. A severe escalation of\nthe Eurozone crisis (room for a break-up) triggers a setback in investment activity - including in Germany.\n\nWhat we're watching Why it matters\n\nChina's growth deceleration should come to an end. But hard economic activity\n\nGenmand indicators, especially for China, have yet to catch up with the increase in prices.\nHence, the current base metal market is already reflecting considerable growth\ngoodwill that is in need of a demand confirmation by China, the US or Europe.\nCopper output continues to undershoot market expectations and should be\n\nSupply watched closely, as investment activity in mines increased sharply. For zinc,\nprospects for mine closures have been delayed and should keep the market\noversupplied.\n\nEconomic data/forward Chinese economic data — trade data, CPI, IP and loan growth by financial\n\ncurve institutions. Key date: 10-15 Oct\n\n2 UBS\n\nRecommendations\n\nTactical (6 months)\n\ne We reiterate that the strong uptick in\nbase metal prices is skating on thin ice, in\nour view. Real activity has yet to follow\nand support prices over a longer time\nperiod. 50% of the upside potential on a\n6-month horizon is likely to be behind us,\nmaking only copper and nickel attractive,\nwith +10% expected return.\n\nStrategic (2 years)\n\ne Although the strongest performance\nshould be visible in zinc and lead, with\nexisting mine capacity expected to peak\nin 2014/15, the recent price strength\nmakes such an investment unattractive\nnow, based on timing. Given a\nstructurally solid supply side, investors\nshould avoid aluminum and nickel.

Though\nonly a handful of my men had arrived, I took the only officer who had, Shai\nAgmon, and an El Al engineer to see whether we could disable the hijacked jet.\nIt was parked well off from the main terminal area.

The engines were still running, but at least the deafening noise\nkept anyone from hearing us as we ducked under the fuselage and the engineer\nremoved a stabilizing pin from the front wheel.

And, since values are not typically stated (my father never said\nliquor at 5 p.m. is a good thing), it certainly isn’t through lectures that\nwe learn values. I learned to drink at 5 p.m. from my father. He wasn’t\ntrying to teach me that. I learned to gamble from my father. He wasn’t\ntrying to teach me that either. I learned to be argumentative from my\nfather. He wasn’t trying to teach that. I did not learn algebra from my\nfather. That, he was trying to teach me.\n\nMy son wanted to grow up and sip Pepsi. He told me this constant-\nly as he was growing up. It did not matter that I hadn’t drunk Pepsi for\n10 years at the point when he was saying that. He was impressed that I\nhad done this when he was 3 and he was frustrated that I didn’t allow\nhim to drink it. Presto, another family value is learned.\n\nChildren learn the family values that their family actually has.\nTeenage mothers who warn against getting pregnant at a young age\nmay say that in words, but their actions say that their kid is alive and\nwell and it all worked out.\n\nSo, it follows that we don’t have to consciously teach values be-\ncause we teach them without saying a word. Values are held subcon-\nsciously and learned subconsciously. We can only hope that we have\nset a good example. That having been said, there will still be those\nwho ask how we can teach values. You can’t expect that “you can’t,”\nwill work as an answet.\n\nI mentioned in Chapter 3 that there are lots of things that you\ncan’t teach. I mentioned honesty as an example. Honesty is, of course,\na value. Now let’s ask whether you can teach people to be more hon-\nest than they are naturally inclined to be. The answer is that to do\nthis, you have to turn a subconscious process into a conscious one.\nYou would need to provide case after case and experience after experi-\nence to a student that all led to the conclusion that honesty simply\nworks out better in the long run. This is, of course, what abstinence\nand say no to drugs campaigns endeavor to do. They want to argue\nkids into believing that things they think are fun, are bad. But how\ncan we make that argument? The argument we can make is that these\nthings aren’t as much fun as you think, so try them and see for your-\nself—but that kind of ruins the basic premise about not doing them\nin the first place. So, in principle there is no way to argue kids into\nnot doing what looks like fun to them and what doesn’t seem to have\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_023868\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

[jeeyacation@gmail.com] \nOpportunity Zones \nimage001.jpg; image002.jpg; image003.jpg; image004.jpg \nImportance: High \nHope all well, are you doing anything around these or clients? \nIn a former warehouse on a dimly lit street in the South Bronx, developers sipping Puerto \nRican moonshine listened as a local official urged them to capture a new U.S. tax break by \nrebuilding the decaying neighborhood. \nIn Alabama, a young lawyer quit his job after seeing the same tax break's potential to help \none of the nation's poorest states. He now spends his days driving his Hyundai from town \nto town, slideshow at the ready, hoping to connect investors with communities. \nAnd on a conference call with potential clients, a prominent hedge fund executive pitched \ninvestments in a boutique hotel in Oakland, which he described as San Francisco's \nBrooklyn. The project is eligible for the same tax break, designed to help the poor. \nBetting on Opportunity Zones \nSales of development sites are surging in areas eligible for tax breaks \nSource: Real Capital Analytics \nFervor about opportunity zones is heating up across the U.S. For a limited time, investors \nwho develop real estate or fund businesses in these areas are able to defer capital gains on \nprofits earned elsewhere and completely eliminate them on new investments in 8,700 low-\nincome census tracts. The goal is to reinvigorate these areas. But the question is whether \nthe 2017 tax law will, as U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin predicts, pump $100 \nbillion into places that need it most, or if investors will play it safe by funding projects in a \nfew zones already on the upswing. \nQuicktakeWill 'Opportunity Zones' Help the Rich, the Poor or Both?  \nThere's no lack of optimism among officials in shrinking Rust Belt towns, wind-swept \nWestern landscapes and hurricane-ravaged Puerto Rico, who hope to jump-start local \neconomies. The incentives are so flexible they could be used for everything from affordable \nhousing to solar farms. \nYet on the investor side, much of the attention is fixed on how to turn a profit in already \nthriving areas. They include neighborhoods surrounding Manhattan, Atlantic beach towns  \ndrawing vacation-home developers, bedroom communities near Silicon Valley and \nanomalies like Portland, Oregon, where the entire downtown was deemed eligible for the \nbreaks. \n\"The phrase I keep thinking of is 'gold rush,' \" said Michael Lortz, an accountant who \nworks with developers in Portland. \"There's a lot of money from out of town that's coming \nhere.\" \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 016413 \nAlready, a policy debate is raging. Backers are urging people to reserve judgment and say \nthe tax breaks have galvanized cities, businesses and investors to think creatively about \nboosting parts of the country most in need. Critics say the incentives were poorly \ncalibrated and may amount to a boondoggle far in excess of the official $1.6 billion \nprojected cost. \nAmericans may have to wait months or years to learn which side is right. That's because \nthe law doesn't require investors to disclose projects, making it difficult to tell which areas \nare benefiting the most. \nBut there's plenty of evidence that a boom is brewing. Goldman Sachs Group Inc., which \nalready had an investment team focusing on struggling communities, has disclosed about \n$150 million in projects in recent months. Purchases of sites inside opportunity zones \nspiked as the tax law took effect, outpacing growth in other areas, according to Real \nCapital Analytics, which tracks property sales. Altogether, investors spent 62 percent more \non properties eligible for tax breaks in the 12 months through September, compared with \nthose in the same census tracts a year earlier, its data show. \nHere are snapshots of what's happening across America: \nBronx Boost \nPort Morris Distillery, which makes a high-alcohol rum called pitorro, was the perfect spot \nfor an opportunity zone pitch. It's on a block with a colorful mural, industrial buildings \nready for loft conversions and views of the Manhattan skyline. Much of the surrounding \nSouth Bronx is now an opportunity zone. \n\"We have always been the most ignored,\" Marlene Cintron, the borough's head of \neconomic development, told an audience of developers and lawyers in November. \"These \nopportunity zones are here for you to take advantage of them.\" \nThe case for the Bronx, where incomes are among the lowest in New York, is that it's the \nlast borough awaiting revitalization. The tax incentives are designed to unleash it. If \ndevelopers can buy at current Bronx prices, before seeing a Brooklyn-like rise, the breaks \nwould be massive. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 016414 \nThe Bronx Tavern and Port Morris Distillery. \nPhotographer: David 'Dee' Delgado/Bloomberg \n\"Huge, huge upside that you're not going to get if you build a strip mall in Topeka,\" said \nTerri Adler, managing partner of law firm Duval & Stachenfeld LLP, who also spoke at the \nevent. \nYet the Bronx faces a formidable problem: It's competing with other zones across the city, \nincluding waterfronts in Brooklyn and Queens with stronger momentum. The tax break \nBronx officials hope will rejuvenate their borough may instead lure more money to what \nlooks like a safer bet across the river. \nIn November, Amazon.com Inc. selected Long Island City for its next headquarters. \nPortions of that Queens neighborhood, including a former plastics factory the retailer \nplans to occupy, are inside opportunity zones, even though they're among the city's fastest-\ngrowing areas. In 2017, more apartments were built there than in any other neighborhood \nin the city. \nDriving Alabama \nAlex Flachsbart, 30, has a lot of time to talk when he's in his SUV crisscrossing Alabama. A \nlawyer who specialized in economic development grants and tax breaks, he quit his job last \nyear to start Opportunity Alabama, aiming to connect capital to worthy projects. For the \npast several months, he's been educating people about opportunity zones, speaking to \nlocal officials, businesses and investors. \n\"I have done the OZ PowerPoint God knows how many times,\" Flachsbart, who grew up in \nthe Bay Area, said from behind the wheel one day in December. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 016415 \nAlex Flachsbart gives a presentation on opportunity zones in Athens, Alabama. \nPhotographer: Nicole Craine/Bloomberg \nWhen he read about opportunity zones in a 2017 draft of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, his \nmind reeled. Here was an uncapped subsidy far more flexible than anything he'd used \nbefore. It could draw investment for an array of projects. He imagined funding startups in \nHuntsville, where NASA's presence has lured a deep bench of talented engineers, and the \nrenovation of an old civic complex in Mobile. \nFlachsbart's nonprofit—which has board members from the state's largest utility and its \nbiggest bank, Regions Financial Corp.—is now in talks for 10 potential projects that need \nmore than $loo million in equity investment, he said. None have been funded yet, but he's \ncertain some will be. Meanwhile, he keeps driving. \nBaltimore Billionaire \nOne of the arguments over opportunity zones is whether the U.S. is handing wealthy \ninvestors and companies big breaks on projects they would've done anyway. One example: \nHedge fund executive and former White House spokesman Anthony Scaramucci plans to \nbuild a \"swank, boutique hotel\" in Oakland. The paperwork for the permit was filed \nmonths before the neighborhood was designated an opportunity zone. \nBut that project pales in comparison to what's happening in Baltimore. More than a year \nbefore President Donald Trump signed the law, real estate developer Steven Siegel helped \nnegotiate one of the largest public financing deals of its kind for a client, a company owned \nby billionaire Kevin Plank, founder of athletic-wear maker Under Armour Inc.  \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 016416 \nPort Covington area of Baltimore. \nPhotographer: Sarah L. Voisin/The Washington Post via Getty Images \nIn 2016, Baltimore's city council approved a $660 million financing package for a 235-acre \nmixed-use development, including new offices for Under Armour, along the city's \nwaterfront. The area was already designated as an enterprise zone and a brownfield site, \nconnoting additional lucrative tax breaks, and the project attracted a $233 million \ninvestment from Goldman Sachs's urban investment group. \nThen came the opportunity zone designation. \nThe tax break is only supposed to apply to real estate purchased after the law took effect. \nBut lawyers across the country quickly began working around that to get the benefits for \nprojects planned before the law was passed. Many tax experts have recommended sales to \nnew entities. So long as the seller owns no more than 20 percent of the buyer, the \ntransaction counts as arm's-length and qualifies. \nSiegel said his firm, Weller Development, has found enough new investors to comply with \nthe arm's-length requirement. The company has seen so much demand, he said, that he's \nlooking to replicate the project elsewhere. \n\"We've been fielding a lot of inbound interest,\" Siegel said, declining to name cities that \nhave approached him. \"That stimulated us to take this show on the road.\" \nBoulder Balks \nIn mid-December, during a marathon city council meeting that stretched past midnight, \nBoulder became perhaps the first jurisdiction in the country to reject its own opportunity \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 016417 \nzone. Officials in the Colorado town imposed an 18-month moratorium on almost all \ndevelopment in its only census tract earmarked for the incentives. \nThe move highlights how local officials have the power to respond to criticisms of the \nlaw—in this case, that investors may rush to build projects the community doesn't want. \nBoulder has long been a favorite spot for growing companies because people want to live \nthere, thanks to its college-town vibe and quick access to nature. \n\"People think we have too much\" development, said Bob Yates, a council member. \"We're \nnot Detroit.\" \nAn eyebrow salon is surrounded by empty stores at Diagonal Plaza in Boulder. \nPhotographer: Rachel Woolf/Bloomberg \nThough Yates, a former telecom executive, opposed the moratorium and worries it will \nmake things difficult for businesses in the zone, he understands why people in Boulder, a \nliberal enclave, were skeptical of an idea enacted by a Republican Congress. He just wishes \nhis city would take a more measured approach. \nThe zone includes an aging mall called Diagonal Plaza. The tax incentives could have \nspurred investors to redevelop it to include affordable housing, which is sorely needed, he \nsaid. \n\"Boulder's teachers can't live in Boulder,\" he said. \"It's not a healthy thing to have \nsocioeconomic divide where lower-income people have to live outside of town to serve \nhigher-income people in town.\" \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 016418 \nPaul V.

A co-investor in Riddell says: “The company had\nbeen bought with a huge amount of debt, and it wasn’t public, so it was meaningless to attach a\nfigure like that to it ... the price it cost was about $1.2 million.” The co-investors bought out\nEpstein’s share in Riddell in 1995 for approximately $3 million. At that time, when Epstein was\nasked, as a routine matter, to sign a paper guaranteeing he had access to a few million dollars in\ncase of any subsequent disputes over the sale price, Wexner signed for him. Epstein has\nexplained that this was because the co-investors wanted an indemnity against being sued by\nWexner. One of the investors calls this “bullshit.”\n\nEpstein’s appointment to the board of New York’s Rockefeller University in 2000 brought him\ninto greater social prominence. Boasting such social names as Nancy Kissinger, Brooke Astor,\nand Robert Bass, the board also includes such pre-eminent scientists as Nobel laureate Joseph\nGoldstein. “Epstein was thrilled to be elected,” says someone who knows him.\n\nAfter one term Epstein resigned. According to New York magazine, this was because he didn’t\nlike to wear a suit to meetings. A spokesperson for the Rockefeller board says Epstein left\nbecause he had insufficient time to commit; a board member recalls that he was “arrogant” and\n“not a good fit.” The spokesperson admits that it is “infrequent” for board members not to be\nrenominated after only one term.\n\nStill, the recent spate of publicity Epstein has inspired does not seem to have fazed him. In\nNovember he was spotted in the front row of the Victoria’s Secret fashion show at New York’s\nLexington Avenue Armory; around the same time the usual coterie of friends and beautiful\nwomen were whisked off to Little St. James (which he tells people has been renamed Little St.\nJeff) for a long weekend.\n\nThanks to Epstein’s introductions, says Martin Nowak, the biologist finds himself moving from\nPrinceton to Harvard, where he is assuming the joint position of professor of mathematics and\nprofessor of biology. Epstein has pledged at least $25 million to Harvard to create the Epstein\nProgram for Mathematical Biology and Evolutionary Dynamics, and Epstein will have an office\nat the university. The program will be dedicated to searching for nature’s algorithms, a pursuit\nthat is a specialty of Nowak’s. For Epstein this must be the summit of everything he has worked\ntoward: he has been seen proudly displaying Harvard president Larry Summers’s letter of\ncommitment as if he can’t quite believe it is real. He says he was reluctant to have his name\nattached to the program, but Summers persuaded him. He rang his mentor Wexner about it, and\nWexner told him it was all right.\n\nAn insatiable, restless soul, always on the move, Epstein builds a tremendous amount of\ndowntime into his hectic work schedule. Yet there is something almost programmed about his\nrelaxation: it’s as if even pleasure has to be measured in terms of self-improvement. Nowak says\nthat, when he goes to stay with Epstein in the Caribbean, they’ll get up at six and, as the sun\nrises, have three-hour conversations about theoretical physics. “Then he’ll go off and do some\nwork, re-appear, and we’ll talk some more.”\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_017785\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

Misha and I had been to\nWashington in September and agreed with the Americans that, unless we were\nattacked by Saddam, we would stay out of it. To do otherwise was clearly not\njust against the US-led coalition’s interests. Given the importance of our\nalliance with Washington, it was against our inrerests as well. Yet with\nhostilities obviously getting closer, Misha phoned Defense Secretary Dick\nCheney a few days later to remind him of the guid pro quo: we would be kept\nfully in the loop about the details and timing of the initial American air strikes.\nAt around five o’clock on the afternoon on January 16, 1991, Misha got a call\nfrom Cheney. He said “h-hour” would be at seven that evening Washington\ntime. Three a.m. in Israel.\n\nThough we hoped to stay out, I’d now spent months coordinating and\noverseeing preparations to ensure we could attack Saddam’s Scuds if necessary.\nBy far most of the missiles were mounted on mobile launching vehicles, and\nSaddam was almost certainly going to be firing them from the vastness of Iraq’s\nwestern desert. That meant an Israeli air strike alone wouldn’t work. We\ndecided on a joint air and ground operation, built around a newly created air-\nmobile division and other special units. A force of 500 to 600 soldiers would\ntake control of key areas and road junctions in western Iraq and start hunting\nand destroying, or at least impeding, the Scud launchers.\n\nWe also engaged in secret diplomacy in the hopes of reducing one of the\nobvious risks in such an attack: a conflict with Jordan, which we’d have to\noverfly to reach Iraq. The Mossad had a unit called 7evel, a kind of shadow\nforeign ministry for states with which we had no formal relations but with\nwhich, in both side’s interests, we had a channel of backdoor communications.\nIt was headed by Ephraim Halevy, a London-born Israeli who had come to\nPalestine in 1948 as a teenager. He had built up a personal relationship with\nKing Hussein, and now arranged for us to meet him at a country residence\nwhich the king had in Britain.\n\nA few weeks before the war, I boarded a private jet to London along with\nHalevy and Prime Minister Shamir. Shamir had never met the king before and\nnor, of course, had I. But we didn’t talk about the forthcoming meeting on the\nfive-hour flight. Instead, Shamir opened up in a way I’d never seen: about his\nchildhood as part of a relatively well-off family in Poland; his love of literature,\nand of the Bible.

He is the author\nof Predictably Irrational and The Upside of Irrationality,\nboth of which became New York Times best sellers.\nDan Ariely was born in New York City while\nhis father was studying for an MBA degree at Columbia\nUniversity. The family returned to Israel when he was\nthree. He grew up in Ramat Hasharon. In his senior year of\nhigh school, he was active in Hanoar Haoved Vehalomed,\nan Israeli youth movement. While preparing a ktovet esh\n(fire inscription) for a traditional nighttime ceremony, the\nflammable materials he was mixing exploded, causing\nthird-degree burns over 70 percent of his body.\nAriely is married to Sumi, with whom\nhe has two children, a son and a daughter.\nAriely was a physics and mathematics major\nat Tel Aviv University, but transferred to philosophy\nand psychology.

Black (born September 13, 1957) is an American\nneurosurgeon specialising in the treatment of brain tumors\nand a prolific campaigner for funding of cancer treatment.\nHe is chairman of the neurosurgery department and\ndirector of the Maxine Dunitz Neurosurgical Institute at\nCedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, California.\nKeith Black was born in Tuskegee, Alabama. His\nmother, Lillian, was a teacher and his father, Robert, was the\nprincipal at a racially segregated elementary school in Auburn,\nAlabama; prohibited by law to integrate the student body,\nBlack’s father instead integrated the faculty, raised standards,\nand brought more challenging subjects to the school. Later in\nhis childhood, Black’s parents found new jobs and relocated\nthe family to Shaker Heights, Ohio. Black attended Shaker\nHeights High School. Already interested in medicine, Black\nwas admitted to an apprenticeship program for minority\nstudents at Case Western Reserve University, and then became\na teenaged lab assistant for Frederick Cross and Richard\nJones (inventors of the Cross-Jones artificial heart valve) at\nSt. Luke’s Hospital in Cleveland. At 17, he won an award in a\nnational science competition for research on the damage done\nto red blood cells in patients with heart-valve replacements.\nAccording to Black: “I was working in the lab of a heart surgeon\nwho had developed his own artificial heart valve, and I had a\nconcept that the heart valve might be damaging red blood cells,\nso I asked to do a research project using a scanning electron\nmicroscope at the time. When I was trying to basically learn\nthe technique, I took some blood from the heart-lung bypass\nmachine from patients undergoing heart-lung bypass, and\nwhen I incubated the red blood cells overnight, I noticed that\na certain percentage of these cells change from their normal\ndiscoid shape to one that resembled a porcupine, called an\neconocyte. What I did was to describe the discocyte-econocyte\ntransformation in patients undergoing heart-lung bypass, as\nan index of sub-lethal red blood cell damage. The importance\nbeing that the blood cells could not parachute through the\nsmall capillaries.” He attended the University of Michigan in\na program that allowed him to earn both his undergraduate\ndegree and his medical degree in 6 years. He received his M.D.\ndegree from the University of Michigan Medical School in 1981.\nAfter serving his internship and residency at the\nUniversity of Michigan, in 1987 he moved to the UCLA\nMedical Center in Los Angeles, where he later became head\nof UCLA’s Comprehensive Brain Tumor Program. In 1997,\nafter 10 years at UCLA, he moved to Cedars-Sinai Medical\nCenter to head the Maxine Dunitz Neurosurgical Institute.\nHe was also on the faculty of the University of California,\nIrvine School of Medicine from 1998 to 2003. In 2007 he\nopened the new Johnnie L. Cochran Jr. Brain Tumor Center\nat Cedars-Sinai, a research center named after the famous\nlawyer who had been Black’s patient and supporter.\nBlack has been a frequent subject of media reports\non medical advances in neurosurgery. He was featured\nin a 1996 episode of the PBS program The New Explorers\nentitled “Outsmarting the Brain”. Esquire included him in\nits November 1999 “Genius Issue” as one of the “21 Most\nImportant People of the 21st Century.” He has been cited as\nan expert in reports about whether mobile phone use affects\nthe incidence of brain tumors. He is also noted for his very\nbusy surgery schedule: a 2004 Discover article noted that he\nperforms about 250 brain surgeries per year, and that at age 46\nhe had “already performed more than 4,000 brain surgeries,\nthe medical equivalent of closing in on baseball’s all-time\ncareer hits record.” (As of 2009, Black’s surgery count had risen\nto “more than 5,000 operations for resection of brain tumors”.)\nIn 1997, Time magazine featured Black on the\ncover of a special edition called “Heroes of Medicine”. The\naccompanying article described Black’s reputation as a\nsurgeon who would operate on tumors that other doctors\nwould not, as well as aspects of his medical research,\nincluding his discovery that the peptide bradykinin can\nbe effective in opening the blood–brain barrier.\nIn 2009 Black published his autobiography, coauthored\nwith Arnold Mann, entitled Brain Surgeon. New\nYork Times reviewer Abigail Zuger described the book as a\n“fascinating, if somewhat stilted, memoir”. The Publishers\nWeekly review commented that the book “examines\nracial hurdles he had to leap to become a neurosurgeon”\nand “alternat[es] incisive writing about incisions with\nhis personal memoir, insightful and inspirational.”\nDAVID BLAINE\nFor more than a decade, David Blaine has been attracting\nthe world’s attention with his high-profile endurance stunts.\nStarting his career as a magician who appeared to do the\nimpossible with a deck of cards, he was soon following in the\nfootsteps of Houdini—seeking out that which seems physically\nimpossible and actually doing it. To that end, he’s been buried\nalive in New York City for a week, barely survived being\nencased inside a six-ton block of ice for three days and three\nnights, stood atop a 100-foot-tall pillar in Bryant Park for 36\nhours without a safety net, survived inside a transparent box in\nLondon on nothing but water for 44 days, and spent one week\nsubmerged in a sphere-shaped aquarium at Lincoln Center, at\nthe end of which he attempted to break the world record for\nbreath holding. A year later, he succeeded live on the Oprah\nWinfrey show, holding his breath for 17 minutes and 4 seconds.\nBorn in Brooklyn, Blaine discovered his passion for\nmagic at the age of four when he saw a magician perform\nin the subway. His mother encouraged his passion and he\nbegan performing professionally at private parties by the age\nof thirteen. By the age of twenty-three, Blaine had created,\ndirected, and produced an original television program titled\nStreet Magic, which garnered rave reviews by critics and\nrevolutionized the way magic is portrayed on television.\nPenn Jillette of Penn & Teller called Street Magic “the best\nTV magic special ever done” and “the biggest breakthrough\nin our lifetime.” The New York Times noted that David has\n“taken a craft that’s been around for hundreds of years\nand done something unique and fresh with it.” The New\nYorker claimed that “he saved magic.” Since then, Blaine\nhas produced nine additional primetime specials.\nBlaine has performed magic privately for U.S.\nPresidents Bill Clinton and George W. Bush, Governor\nArnold Schwarzenegger, Bill Gates, Henry Kissinger, Mayor\nBloomberg, Mark Zuckerberg, and Muhammad Ali, as\nwell as President Dmitry Medvedev of Russia and other\ninternational leaders. He also performed alongside Michael\nJackson, and during the Super Bowl halftime show.\nIn 2010, Blaine performed magic for 72 hours\nstraight in Times Square, raising nearly $100,000 for\nrelief efforts following the earthquake in Haiti.\nBlaine resides in New York City with his\nfiancée, Alizee Guinochet. The couple welcomed a\nmagical daughter into the world on January 27, 2011.\nMICHAEL GLEN BLOCK\nMichael Glen Block (born May 25, 1982) is an American\ncellist, composer, arranger, and solo artist hailed as “the\nideal musician of the twenty-first century” by cultural icon\nYo-Yo Ma.

Out of the\nlab, he founded Seed—tag-lined “Science is Culture™”—and\nserved as its Editor-in-Chief. “The best comparison for Seed,”\nwrote a media critic at the time of the magazine’s launch in\n2001, “is the early years of Rolling Stone, when music was less a\nsubject than a lens for viewing culture.” Under his leadership,\nthe magazine earned critical acclaim for modernizing\nscientific publishing and for bridging long-standing divides\nbetween science and society—from art and design to politics\nand religion. Together with Paola Antonelli he co-founded a\nmonthly gathering of scientists, architects, and designers\nthat laid the foundation for Design and the Elastic Mind,\nan exhibition about science and design at The Museum\nof Modern Art.\nIn 2007, Bly was named a Young Global Leader\nby the World Economic Forum. He is a recipient of the\nGolden Jubilee Medal from Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II\nand his achievements have been highlighted by Canadian\nPrime Minister Jean Chrétien, “for showing people the\nscope and power of science not just as an object of study\nbut as a key to understanding the world around us.”\nBly has lectured around the world on the future of\nscience and its role in society, including at the World Economic\nForum, the National Academies of Science, the Royal Society,\nthe National Institutes of Health, the State Department,\nNASA, the Chinese Ministry of Science and Technology, The\nMuseum of Modern Art, and The Academy of Sciences for the\nDeveloping World, before the National Science Board and the\nU.S. House of Representatives, and at universities including\nHarvard, MIT, and Beijing. He has served on the nominating\ncommittees and juries of the Buckminster Fuller Challenge,\nthe Earth Award, and the TED Prize, and sits on the Science\nAdvisory Committee of the World Economic Forum, the\nExternal Advisory Board of the University of Michigan’s Risk\nScience Center, the American Committee of the Weizmann\nInstitute of Science, the Communications Advisory Board\nof the National Academy of Sciences, and as an advisor to\nOECD’s Global Project on Measuring the Progress of Societies.\nBly was recently named Vice Chair of the World\nEconomic Forum’s Global Agenda Council on Design\nInnovation and Partner to the Executive Coordination\nOffice for the Rio+20 United Nations Conference\non Sustainable Development.\nSCOTT BOLTON\nDr. Scott Bolton is the Director of the Space Sciences\nDepartment at Southwest Research Institute (SwRI) in San\nAntonio, Texas.

He worked as\nan editorial writer and film reviewer for the Washington Times;\na reporter and later op-ed editor for The Wall Street Journal;\na senior editor at The Weekly Standard from its inception; a\ncontributing editor at Newsweek and The Atlantic Monthly;\nand as a commentator on National Public Radio. He is\nnow a columnist for The New York Times and commentator\non PBS NewsHour.\nBrooks, who is Jewish, was born in Toronto,\nCanada—his father was a U.S. citizen living in Canada at the\ntime—and grew up in New York City in Stuyvesant Town. He\ngraduated from Grace Church School in New York City, Radnor\nHigh School (located in a Main Line suburb of Philadelphia)\nin 1979 and from the University of Chicago, with a degree\nin history, in 1983.\nBrooks edited a 1996 anthology of writings by\nnew conservative writers, Backward and Upward: The New\nConservative Writing. He wrote a book of cultural commentary\ntitled Bobos in Paradise: The New Upper Class and How They\nGot There, published in 2000, and followed it four years later\nwith On Paradise Drive: How We Live Now (And Always Have)\nin the Future Tense.\nHe also authored The Social Animal: The Hidden\nSources of Love, Character and Achievement. The book was\nexcerpted in The New Yorker magazine in January 2011\nand received mixed reviews upon its full publication, by\nRandom House, in March of that year. The book has been a\ncommercial success, reaching the #3 spot on the Publishers\nWeekly best-sellers list for non-fiction in April 2011.\nBrooks was a visiting professor of public policy at\nDuke University’s Terry Sanford Institute of Public Policy, and\nhe taught an undergraduate seminar there in the fall of 2006.\nHe and his wife live in the Cleveland Park\nneighborhood of Northwest Washington, DC.\nBrooks describes himself as being originally a liberal\nbefore “coming to my senses.” In 1983, he wrote a parody\nof conservative pundit William F. Buckley Jr., which said\n“In the afternoons he is in the habit of going into crowded\nrooms and making everybody else feel inferior. The evenings\nare reserved for extended bouts of name-dropping.”\nBuckley admired the parody and offered Brooks\na job with National Review. A turning point in Brooks’s\nthinking came later that year in a televised debate with\nMilton Friedman, which, as Brooks describes it, “was\nessentially me making a point, and he making a twosentence\nrebuttal which totally devastated my point.”\nBefore the 2003 invasion of Iraq, Brooks argued\nforcefully for American military intervention, echoing the\nbelief of commentators and political figures that American\nand British forces would be welcomed as liberators. In the\nspring of 2004, some of his opinion pieces suggested that\nhe had tempered his earlier optimism about the war.\nBrooks’ public writing about the U.S. wars in\nAfghanistan and Iraq is similar to those by neoconservatives,\naccording to a Salon article by Glenn Greenwald, that labels\nBrooks as a neoconservative. His angry dismissal of the\nconviction of Scooter Libby as being “a farce” and having “no\nsignificance” was derided by political blogger Andrew Sullivan.\nOn August 10, 2006, Brooks wrote a column for The\nNew York Times titled “Party No. 3”. The column proposed\nthe idea of the McCain-Lieberman Party, or the fictional\nrepresentation of the fictional moderate majority in America.\nOttawa Citizen commentator David Warren has\nidentified Brooks as the sort of conservative pundit that\nliberals like, someone who is “sophisticated” and “engages\nwith” the liberal agenda, in contrast to a real conservative like\nCharles Krauthammer. Brooks has long been a supporter of\nJohn McCain; however, he did not show a liking for McCain’s\n2008 running mate, Sarah Palin, calling her a “cancer” on\nthe Republican Party. He has referred to her as a “joke,”\nunlikely to ever win the Republican nomination. But he later\nadmitted during a CSPAN interview that he had gone too far\nin his previous “cancer” comments about Palin, which he\nregretted, and simply stated he was not a fan of her values.\nIn a March 2007 article published in The New\nYork Times titled “No U-Turns”, Brooks explained that the\nRepublican Party must distance itself from the minimalgovernment\nconservative principles that had arisen\nduring the Abraham Lincoln, Barry Goldwater, Ronald\nReagan and Calvin Coolidge eras. He claims that these\ncore concepts had served their purposes and should\nno longer be embraced by Republicans in order to win\nelections, which he considers the most important purpose\nof a political party designed to serve the political class.\nBrooks has been a frequent admirer of President\nBarack Obama. In an August 2009 profile of Brooks, The\nNew Republic describes his first encounter with Obama, in the\nspring of 2005: “Usually when I talk to senators, while they\nmay know a policy area better than me, they generally don’t\nknow political philosophy better than me. I got the sense he\nknew both better than me. […] I remember distinctly an image\nof—we were sitting on his couches, and I was looking at his\npant leg and his perfectly creased pant, and I’m thinking,\na) he’s going to be president and b) he’ll be a very good\npresident.” Two days after Obama’s second autobiography,\nThe Audacity of Hope, hit bookstores, Brooks published a\ncolumn in The New York Times, titled “Run, Barack, Run”,\nurging the Chicago politician to run for president. However as\nof December 2011 in a CSPAN interview, Brook’s opinion of\nObama’s presidency was more tempered, giving Obama only\na “B-” rating, and said that Obama’s chances of reelection\nwould be less than 50-50 if elections were held at that time.\nIn writing for The New York Times in January 2010,\nBrooks described Israel as “an astonishing success story”.\nHe wrote that “Jews are a famously accomplished group,”\nwho, because they were “forced to give up farming in the\nMiddle Ages... have been living off their wits ever since”. In\nBrooks’ view, “Israel’s technological success is the fruition\nof the Zionist dream. The country was not founded so stray\nsettlers could sit among thousands of angry Palestinians\nin Hebron. It was founded so Jews would have a safe place\nto come together and create things for the world.”\nBrooks opposes what he sees as self-destructive\nbehavior, such as teenage sex and divorce. His view is that\n“sex is more explicit everywhere barring real life. As the\nentertainment media have become more sex-saturated,\nAmerican teenagers have become more sexually abstemious”\nby “waiting longer to have sex…[and] having fewer partners.”\nHe sees the culture war as nearly over, because “today’s\nyoung people…seem happy with the frankness of the left\nand the wholesomeness of the right.” As a result, he\nis optimistic about the United States’ social stability,\nwhich he considers to be “in the middle of an\namazing moment of improvement and repair.”\nBrooks also broke with many in the conservative\nmovement when, in late 2003, he came out in favor of samesex\nmarriage in his New York Times column. He equated\nthe idea with traditional conservative values: “We should\ninsist on gay marriage. We should regard it as scandalous\nthat two people could claim to love each other and not\nwant to sanctify their love with marriage and fidelity.…\nIt’s going to be up to conservatives to make the important,\nmoral case for marriage, including gay marriage.”\nRegarding abortion, Brooks has advocated for\npro-choice government regulations: abortion should be\nlegal, with parental consent for minors, during the first four\nor five months, and illegal afterward, except in extremely\nrare circumstances. (New York Times, April 22, 2002.)\nMARK CUBAN\nWhen Mark Cuban purchased the Dallas Mavericks on\nJanuary 14, 2000, the face of the organization began to\nchange immediately. Once again Mavericks games had\na party atmosphere as Reunion Arena rocked with the\nreturn of the “Reunion Rowdies.” Mavericks games\nbecame more than just ordinary NBA games—\nthey were a total entertainment experience.\nCuban was not only successful at instilling a sense\nof pride and passion into Mavericks fans by presenting himself\nas the ultimate role model by cheering from the same seats he\nhad in years past, but he also became the first owner in team\nsports to encourage fan interaction through e-mail on his\npersonal computer. It was through this personal touch that\nfans throughout the Metroplex, and around the world, began\nto notice Cuban’s energetic personality and take notice of\nthe Mavericks. He has personally responded to thousands\nof emails, and several suggestions from fans have led to\ninnovative changes such as a new three-sided shot clock,\nwhich allows line of site to the 24-second clock from\nanywhere in the arena.\nCuban’s whatever-it-takes attitude and commitment\nto winning has everyone’s attention. From his first introduction\nto the team to the end of his first season as owner, the players\nresponded with a 31-19 record, including a 9-1 mark in April\n2000. In addition to hiring special coaches for offense,\ndefense and shooting, Cuban has promised to do everything\nin his power to improve the team. This goal was achieved as\nthe club finished the 2000-01 season with a 53-29 record en\nroute to their first playoff appearance in 11 years where they\nbecame just the sixth team in NBA history to be down 0-2 and\ncome back to win a five-game series vs. Utah in Round 1.\nBefore the start of the 2001-02 season, American\nAirlines Center, the Mavs new home, opened and Cuban\nco-founded HDNet, an all high-definition television network\non DIRECTV channel 199 which launched in September\n2001. As with his other ventures, Cuban is revolutionizing\nthe television industry with HDNet. He is planning to expand\nHDNet to include three more networks showing high-def\nsports, movies and entertainment by the end of 2002.\nDuring the Mavs 2001-02 campaign, the team\ncontinued their winning ways by finishing the season with\na franchise-best record of 57-25 and an NBA-best road\nrecord of 27-14, advancing to the postseason for the\nsecond-consecutive year.\nPrior to his purchase of the Mavericks, Cuban cofounded\nBroadcast.com, the leading provider of multimedia\nand streaming on the Internet, in 1995, selling it to Yahoo!\nin July of 1999. Before Broadcast.com, Cuban co-founded\nMicroSolutions, a leading National Systems Integrator,\nin 1983, and later sold it to CompuServe.\nToday, in addition to his ownership of the Mavericks,\nCuban is an active investor in leading and cutting-edge\ntechnologies and continues to be a sought-after speaker.\nANTONIO DAMASIO\nAntonio Damasio (born February 25, 1944 in Lisbon, Portugal)\nis a University Professor (an award based on multi-disciplinary\ninterests and significant accomplishments in several\ndisciplines) and David Dornsife Professor of Neuroscience at\nthe University of Southern California, where he heads USC’s\nBrain and Creativity Institute. Prior to taking up his posts at\nUSC, in 2005, Damasio was M.W. Van Allen Professor and\nHead of Neurology at the University of Iowa Hospitals and\nClinics from 1976 to 2005. He is also Adjunct Professor\nat the Salk Institute.\nDamasio is the author of several best-selling\nbooks which describe his scientific thinking. “As a leading\nneuroscientist, Damasio has dared to speculate on\nneurobiological data, and has offered a theory about the\nrelationship between human emotions, human rationality,\nand the underlying biology.”\nDamasio was born in Lisbon and studied medicine\nat the University of Lisbon Medical School in Portugal, where\nhe also did his neurological residency and completed his\ndoctorate. He worked as a research fellow at the Aphasia\nResearch Center in Boston in 1967, prior to receiving his\nMD in Lisbon. His work there on behavioural neurology\nwas done under the supervision of the late Norman\nGeschwind, the Harvard neurologist who created the field.\nAs a researcher, Damasio’s main field is the\nneurobiology of the mind, especially neural systems which\nsubserve emotion, decision-making, memory, language and\nconsciousness. Damasio’s seeks to demonstrate that emotions\nplay a critical role in high level cognition, an idea that ran\ncounter to dominant 20th century views in psychology,\nneuroscience and philosophy. He showed that emotions and\ntheir biological underpinnings are involved in decision-making\n(both positively and negatively, and often non-consciously);\nprovide the scaffolding for the construction of social cognition;\nand are required for the self processes which undergird\nconsciousness. “Damasio provides a contemporary scientific\nvalidation of the linkage between feelings and the body by\nhighlighting the connection between mind and nerve cells…\nthis personalized embodiment of mind.”\nHe formulated the somatic markers hypothesis,\nwhich captures the essence of these ideas. This idea has\ninspired many systems-neuroscience experiments carried out\nin laboratories in the U.S. and Europe, and has had a major\nimpact in contemporary science and philosophy. His articles\non this topic include: Bechara A, Damasio AR, Damasio H,\nAnderson S. Insensitivity to future consequences following\ndamage to human prefrontal cortex. Cognition. 50:7-15. 1994;\nBechara A, Damasio H, Tranel D, Damasio AR. Deciding\nadvantageously before knowing the advantageous strategy.\nScience. 275:1293-1294. 1997; Anderson SW, Bechara A,\nDamasio H, Tranel D, Damasio AR. Impairment of social\nand moral behaviour related to early damage in human\nprefrontal cortex. Nature Neuroscience. 2:1032-1037. Damasio\nhas been named by the Institute of Scientific Information as\none of the most highly cited researchers in the past decade).\nCurrent work on the biology of moral decisions, neuroeconomics,\nsocial communication, and drug-addiction,\nhas been strongly influenced by Damasio’s hypothesis.\nDamasio also proposed that emotions are part of\nhomeostatic regulation and are rooted in reward/punishment\nmechanisms. He recovered James’ perspective on feelings as\na read-out of body states, but expanded it with an “as-if-bodyloop”\ndevice which allows for the substrate of feelings to be\nsimulated rather than actual (foreshadowing the simulation\nprocess later uncovered by mirror neurons). He demonstrated\nexperimentally that the insular cortex is a critical platform\nfor feelings, a finding that has been widely replicated, and\nhe uncovered cortical and subcortical induction sites for\nhuman emotions, e.g. in ventromedial prefrontal cortex\nand amygdala. He also demonstrated that while the\ninsular cortex plays a major role in feelings, it is not\nnecessary for feelings to occur, suggesting that brain\nstem structures play a basic role in the feeling process.\nHe has continued to investigate the neural basis of\nfeelings and demonstrated that although the insular cortex is\na major substrate for this process it is not exclusive, suggesting\nthat brain stem nuclei are critical platforms as well. He\nregards feelings as the necessary foundation of sentience.\nIn another development, Damasio proposed that\nthe cortical architecture on which learning and recall depend\ninvolves multiple, hierarchically organized loops of axonal\nprojections that converge on certain nodes out of which\nprojections diverge to the points of origin of convergence\n(the convergence-divergence framework). This architecture\nis applicable to the understanding of memory processes\nand of aspects of consciousness related to the access\nof mental contents.\nIn “The Feeling of What Happens”, Damasio lays\nthe foundations of the “enchainment of precedences”: “the\nnonconscious neural signaling of an individual organism\nbegets the protoself which permits core self and core\nconsciousness, which allow for an autobiographical self,\nwhich permits extended consciousness. At the end of the\nchain, extended consciousness permits conscience.\nDamasio’s research depended significantly on\nestablishing the modern human lesion method, an enterprise\nmade possible by Hanna Damasio’s structural neuroimaging/\nneuroanatomy work complemented by experimental\nneuroanatomy (with Gary Van Hoesen and Josef Parvizi),\nexperimental neuropsychology (with Antoine Bechara, Ralph\nAdolphs, and Dan Tranel) and functional neuroimaging (with\nKaspar Meyer, Jonas Kaplan, and Mary Helen Immordino-\nYang). The experimental neuroanatomy work with Van Hoesen\nand Bradley Hyman led to the discovery of the disconnection\nof the hippocampus caused by neurofibrillary tangles in the\nentophinal cortex of patients with Alzheimer’s disease.\nAs a clinician, he and his collaborators\nhave studied and treated disorders of behaviour\nand cognition, and movement disorders.\nDamasio’s books deal with the relationship between\nemotions and feelings, and what their brain substrates. His\n1994 book, Descartes’ Error: Emotion, Reason and the Human\nBrain, won the Science et Vie prize, was a finalist for the\nLos Angeles Times Book Award, and is translated in over 30\nlanguages. It is regarded as one of the most influential books\nof the past two decades. His second book, The Feeling of What\nHappens: Body and Emotion in the Making of Consciousness,\nwas named as one of the ten best books of 2001 by the New\nYork Times Book Review, a Publishers Weekly Best Book of\nthe Year, a Library Journal Best Book of the Year, and has\nover 30 foreign editions. Damasio’s Looking for Spinoza: Joy,\nSorrow, and the Feeling Brain, was published in 2003. In it,\nDamasio suggested that Spinoza’s thinking foreshadowed\ndiscoveries in biology and neuroscience views on the mindbody\nproblem. Spinoza was a protobiologist. His latest book\nis Self Comes to Mind: Constructing the Conscious Brain. In\nit Damasio suggests that the self is the key to conscious\nminds and that feelings, from the kind he designates as\nprimordial to the well-known feelings of emotion, are the\nbasic elements in the construction of the protoself and core\nself. The book received the Corinne International Book Prize.\nDamasio is a member of the American Academy of\nArts and Sciences, the National Academy of Sciences’ Institute\nof Medicine, and the European Academy of Sciences and Arts.\nDamasio has received many awards including the Prince of\nAsturias Award in Science and Technology, the Honda Prize,\nthe Kappers Neuroscience Medal, the Beaumont Medal from\nthe American Medical Association, the Nonino Prize and the\nReenpaa Prize in Neuroscience. He has received honorary\ndoctoral degrees (Doctor honoris causa) from the University\nof Aachen (2002), University of Aveiro (2003), University\nof Copenhagen (Copenhagen Business School; 2009),\nUniversity of Leiden (2010), University Ramon Llull,\nBarcelona (2010), University of Coimbra (2011) and\nfrom the EPFL, Lausanne (2011).\nHis current work involves the social emotions,\nconsciousness and the creative interface between\nneuroscience and the arts, especially music and\nfilm. The role of feelings states on sentience.\nDamasio is married to Dr. Hanna Damasio,\nhis colleague and frequent co-author.\nDamasio himself notes, in fallibilist fashion,\n“I have a difficult time seeing scientific results, especially in\nneurobiology, as anything but provisional approximations”’.\nWhether despite or because of that fallibilism, Damasio\nwrites in the belief that ‘scientific knowledge can\nbe a pillar to help humans endure and prevail’.\nOUR HOST\nJACK DANGERMOND\nJack Dangermond is the founder and president of Esri, the\nworld’s fourth largest privately held software company.\nFounded in 1969 and headquartered in Redlands, California,\nEsri is widely recognized as the technical and market leader\nin geographic information systems, or GIS, pioneering\ninnovative solutions for working with spatial data.\nEsri has more than one million users in over 350,000\norganizations representing government; nongovernmental\norganizations (NGOs); academia; and industries such as\nutilities, health care, transportation, telecommunications,\nhomeland security, retail, and agriculture.\nDangermond is recognized not only as a pioneer\nin spatial analysis methods but also as one of the most\ninfluential people in GIS.

For more than 25 years, Dr. Gallo has been at the\nforefront of ocean exploration, participating in and being\nwitness to the development of new technologies and scientific\ndiscoveries that shape our view of planet earth. He has been\ndescribed by TED Conferences as “an enthusiastic ambassador\nbetween the sea and those of us on dry land.” With more than\n8 million views his TED presentation “Underwater\nAstonishments” is among the top 5 TED Talks viewed to date.\nDavid has participated in expeditions to all of\nthe world’s oceans and was one of the first scientists to\nuse a combination of robots and submarines to explore\nthe deep seafloor. Most recently he co-led an expedition\nto create the first detailed and comprehensive map of the\nRMS Titanic and he co-led the successful international\neffort to locate the remains of Air France flight 447.\nDr. Gallo is currently active in planning a series of\nchallenging expeditions and is encouraging the development\nof new technologies for ocean exploration. He is a member\nof James Cameron’s Deep Ocean Task Force and the\nXPrize Ocean Advisory Board. Almost every expedition\ninto the deep provides results that are often surprising,\nsometimes startling and in many cases revolutionary.\nDavid is becoming increasingly outspoken about\nthe relationship between humanity and the sea. He feels\nstrongly that instead of taking the oceans for granted we need\nto recognize the oceans critical role in providing the air we\nbreath, the water we drink, and the food we eat. At the same\ntime, Dr. Gallo feels that human activity has impacted the\nocean on a global scale and with significant consequences.\nThe oceans hold the clues to our past and the key to our future\nyet they remain mostly unexplored and poorly understood.\nDr. Gallo is personally committed to conveying\nthe excitement and importance of ocean exploration to the\npublic-at-large. He has lectured internationally to audiences\nranging from children to CEO’s with the goal of awakening\nthe little bit of Jacques Cousteau and Jules Vernes that resides\nin each of us.

He\nis a National Fellow of the Explorer’s Club, a member of the\nAmerican Geophysical Union, and active on several boards\nincluding the Marine Environmental Research Institute, the\nOne World One Ocean Campaign, and the Terramar Project.\nFRANK GEHRY\nRaised in Toronto, Canada, Frank Gehry moved with his family\nto Los Angeles in 1947. Mr. Gehry received his Bachelor of\nArchitecture degree from the University of Southern California\nin 1954, and he studied City Planning at the Harvard University\nGraduate School of Design. In subsequent years, Mr. Gehry\nhas built an architectural career that has spanned five decades\nand produced public and private buildings in America, Europe\nand Asia. Hallmarks of Mr. Gehry’s work include a particular\nconcern that people exist comfortably within the spaces that\nhe creates, and an insistence that his buildings address the\ncontext and culture of their sites and the budgets of his clients.\nHis work has earned Mr. Gehry several of the most\nsignificant awards in the architectural field. He was inducted\ninto the College of Fellows of the American Institute of\nArchitects in 1974, and his buildings have received over 100\nnational and regional A.I.A. awards. In 1977, Mr. Gehry was\nnamed recipient of the Arnold W. Brunner Memorial Prize\nin Architecture from the American Academy of Arts and\nLetters. In 1989, he was awarded the Pritzker Architecture\nPrize, perhaps the premiere accolade of the field, honoring\n“significant contributions to humanity and the built\nenvironment through the art of architecture.” In 1992, he\nreceived the Wolf Prize in Art (Architecture) from the Wolf\nFoundation. In the same year, he was named the recipient of\nthe Praemium Imperiale Award by the Japan Art Association\nto “honor outstanding contributions to the development,\npopularization, and progress of the arts.” In 1994, he became\nthe first recipient of the Dorothy and Lillian Gish Award for\nlifetime contribution to the arts.

His father, Homer, was a\ncartoonist and filmmaker. From an early age, Matt created\nhis own cartoons, amusing his friends and annoying his\nteachers. Groening attended Evergreen State College\nin Washington State, where he studied philosophy and\ncontinued his interest in cartoons, comics and music.\nAfter his graduation in 1977, Groening headed to\nLos Angeles where he struggled in immobilizing but irksome\npoverty. Increasingly frustrated by the traffic, smog, and\nhis landlords, Matt began to vent his angst to his friends by\nsending them cartoons starring a bug-eyed rabbit named\nBinky. Groening soon began to publish and sell these cartoons\nat the record shop where he worked. Their popularity\nencouraged Matt to syndicate, and in April 1980, Life In Hell®\nformally debuted in the Los Angeles Reader. It was there that\nhe met his future wife, Deborah Caplan, and together\nthey formed Acme Features Syndicate, which today\ncirculates Life in Hell® to more than 250 newspapers\naround the world in a half-dozen languages.\nLife in Hell® has also been collected in a bestselling\nseries of books with over two million copies in print,\nincluding Love is Hell, Work is Hell, School is Hell, Childhood\nis Hell, Akbar & Jeff ’s Guide to Life, Greetings From Hell, The\nBig Book of Hell, With Love From Hell, How to Go to Hell, The\nRoad to Hell, Binky’s Guide to Love, and Love is Still Hell.\nIn 1987 James L. Brooks approached Matt about\ncreating animated shorts to fit between sketches of “The\nTracey Ullman Show.” Matt agreed, but instead of using the\nLife in Hell® characters, he created an entirely new cast:\nThe Simpsons, which bear the names of his family members,\nHomer, Marge, Lisa and Maggie (Bart is an anagram for brat).\nThe Simpsons were soon spun off into a half-hour\nanimated series which first aired on December 17, 1989\nwith a Christmas special, followed by the series premiere\non January 14, 1990. It has since gone on to become\nthe longest running prime-time animated show in\ntelevision history. An international hit, the series has\nalso spawned a licensing and merchandising empire.\nBooks based on The Simpsons include The Simpsons\nXmas Book, Greetings From The Simpsons, The Simpsons\nRainy Day Fun Book, The Simpsons Uncensored Family Album,\nMaggie Simpson’s Alphabet Book, Maggie Simpson’s Counting\nBook, Maggie Simpson’s Book of Colors & Shapes, Maggie\nSimpson’s Book of Animals, The Simpsons Fun in the Sun Book,\nMaking Faces With The Simpsons, The Ultra-Jumbo Rain-\nOr-Shine Fun Book, Cartooning With The Simpsons, Bart’s\nGuide To Life and The Simpsons: A Complete Guide To Our\nFavorite Family, a campanion book to the television series.\nGroening is also creator and publisher\nof Bongo Comics and Zongo Comics.\nHERBIE HANCOCK\nHerbie Hancock is a true icon of modern music. Throughout\nhis explorations, he has transcended limitations and\ngenres while maintaining his unmistakable voice. With an\nillustrious career spanning five decades and 14 Grammy®\nAwards, including Album of the Year for River: The Joni\nLetters, he continues to amaze audiences across the globe.\nThere are few artists in the music industry\nwho have had more influence on acoustic and electronic\njazz and R&B than Herbie Hancock. As the immortal\nMiles Davis said in his autobiography, “Herbie was\nthe step after Bud Powell and Thelonious Monk, and I\nhaven’t heard anybody yet who has come after him.”\nBorn in Chicago in 1940, Herbie was a child\npiano prodigy who performed a Mozart piano concerto\nwith the Chicago Symphony Orchestra at age 11. He\nbegan playing jazz in high school, initially influenced\nby Oscar Peterson and Bill Evans. He also developed a\npassion for electronics and science, and double-majored\nin music and electrical engineering at Grinnell College.\nIn 1960, Herbie was discovered by trumpeter Donald\nByrd. After two years of session work with Byrd as well as\nPhil Woods and Oliver Nelson, he signed with Blue Note\nas a solo artist. His 1963 debut album, ‘Takin’ Off ’, was an\nimmediate success, producing the hit “Watermelon Man.”\nIn 1963, Miles Davis invited Herbie to join the\nMiles Davis Quintet. During his five years with Davis, Herbie\nand his colleagues Wayne Shorter (tenor sax), Ron Carter\n(bass), and Tony Williams (drums) recorded many classics,\nincluding ‘ESP’, ‘Nefertiti’ and ‘Sorcerer’. Later on, Herbie\nmade appearances on Davis’ groundbreaking ‘In a Silent Way’\nand ‘Bitches Brew’, which heralded the birth of jazz-fusion.\nHerbie’s own solo career blossomed on Blue Note,\nwith classic albums including ‘Maiden Voyage’, ‘Empyrean\nIsles’, and ‘Speak Like a Child’. He composed the score to\nMichelangelo Antonioni’s 1966 film ‘Blow Up’, which led to\na successful career in feature film and television music.\nAfter leaving Davis, Herbie put together a new\nband called The Headhunters and, in 1973, recorded ‘Head\nHunters.’ With its crossover hit single “Chameleon,”\nit became the first jazz album to go platinum.\nBy mid-decade, Herbie was playing for stadium-sized\ncrowds all over the world and had no fewer than four albums in\nthe pop charts at once. In total, Herbie had 11 albums in the pop\ncharts during the 1970s. His ’70s output inspired and provided\nsamples for generations of hip-hop and dance music artists.\nHerbie also stayed close to his love of acoustic\njazz in the ’70s, recording and performing with VSOP\n(reuniting him with his Miles Davis colleagues), and in\nduet settings with Chick Corea and Oscar Peterson.\nIn 1980, Herbie introduced the trumpeter Wynton\nMarsalis to the world as a solo artist, producing his debut\nalbum and touring with him as well. In 1983, a new pull to the\nalternative side led Herbie to a series of collaborations with\nBill Laswell. The first, ‘Future Shock’, again struck platinum,\nand the single “Rockit” rocked the dance and R&B charts,\nwinning a Grammy for Best R&B Instrumental. The video of\nthe track won five MTV awards. ‘Sound System’, the follow-up,\nalso received a Grammy in the R&B instrumental category.\nHerbie won an Oscar in 1986 for scoring the\nfilm “’Round Midnight”, in which he also appeared as\nan actor. Numerous television appearances over the\nyears led to two hosting assignments in the 1980s: “Rock\nSchool” on PBS and Showtime’s “Coast To Coast”.\nAfter an adventurous 1994 project for Mercury\nRecords, ‘Dis Is Da Drum’, he moved to the Verve label,\nforming an all-star band to record 1996’s Grammywinning\n‘The New Standard’. In 1997, an album of\nduets with Wayne Shorter, ‘1+1’, was released.\nThe legendary Headhunters reunited in 1998,\nrecording an album for Herbie’s own Verve-distributed\nimprint, and touring with the Dave Matthews Band. That\nyear also marked the recording and release of ‘Gershwin’s\nWorld’, which included collaborators Joni Mitchell, Stevie\nWonder, Kathleen Battle, the Orpheus Chamber Orchestra,\nWayne Shorter and Chick Corea. ‘Gershwin’s World’ won three\nGrammys in 1999, including Best Traditional Jazz Album\nand Best R&B Vocal Performance for Stevie Wonder’s\n“St. Louis Blues.”\nHerbie reunited with Bill Laswell to collaborate\nwith some young hip-hop and techno artists on\n2001’s FUTURE2FUTURE. He also joined with Roy\nHargrove and Michael Brecker in 2002 to record a live\nconcert album, ‘Directions In Music: Live at Massey\nHall’, a tribute to John Coltrane and Miles Davis.\n‘Possibilities’, released in August 2005, teamed\nHerbie with many popular artists, such as Sting, Annie Lennox,\nJohn Mayer, Christina Aguilera, Paul Simon, Carlos Santana,\nJoss Stone and Damien Rice. That year, he played a number\nof concert dates with a re-staffed Headhunters,\nand became the first-ever Artist-In-Residence at\nthe Tennessee-based festival Bonnaroo.\nIn 2007, Hancock recorded and released ‘River: The\nJoni Letters’, a tribute to longtime friend and collaborator Joni\nMitchell featuring Wayne Shorter, guitarist Lionel Loueke,\nbassist Dave Holland and drummer Vinnie Colaiuta and coproduced\nby Larry Klein. He enlisted vocalists Norah Jones,\nTina Turner, Corinne Bailey Rae, Luciana Souza, Leonard\nCohen and Mitchell herself to perform songs she wrote or was\ninspired by. The album received glowing reviews and was a\nyear-end Top 10 choice for many critics. It also garnered three\nGrammy Awards, including Album of the Year; Herbie is one\nof only a handful of jazz musicians ever to receive that honor.\nIn 2010 Hancock released the critically-acclaimed\nCD, ‘Herbie Hancock’s The Imagine Project,’ winner of two\n20ll Grammy Awards for Best Pop Collaboration and Best\nImprovised Jazz Solo. Utilizing the universal language of\nmusic to express its central themes of peace and global\nresponsibility, the ‘Imagine’ project was recorded around\nthe world and features a stellar group of musicians\nincluding Jeff Beck, Seal,Pink, Dave Matthews, The\nChieftains, Lionel Loueke, Oumou Sangare, Konono\n#l, Anoushka Shankar, Chaka Khan, Marcus Miller,\nDerek Trucks, Susan Tedeschi, Tinariwen, and Ceu.\nHerbie Hancock also maintains a thriving career\noutside the performing stage and recording studio. Recently\nnamed by the Los Angeles Philharmonic as Creative Chair\nFor Jazz, he currently also serves as Institute Chairman of the\nThelonious Monk Institute of Jazz, the foremost international\norganization devoted to the development of jazz performance\nand education worldwide. Hancock is also a founder of\nThe International Committee of Artists for Peace, and was\nrecently awarded the much esteemed “Commandeur des Arts\net des Lettres” by French Prime Minister Francois Fillon.\nIn July of 2011 Hancock was designated a UNESCO\nGoodwill Ambassador by UNESCO Director-General Irina\nBokova. Recognizing Herbie Hancock’s “dedication to the\npromotion of peace through dialogue, culture and the arts,”\nthe Director-General has asked the celebrated jazz musician\n“to contribute to UNESCO’s efforts to promote mutual\nunderstanding among cultures, with a particular emphasis on\nfostering the emergence of new and creative ideas amongst\nyouth, to find solutions to global problems, as well as ensuring\nequal access to the diversity of artistic expressions.” UNESCO’s\nGoodwill Ambassadors are an outstanding group of celebrity\nadvocates who have generously accepted to use their talent\nand status to help focus the world’s attention on the objectives\nand aims of UNESCO’s work in its fields of competence:\neducation, culture, science and communication/information\nNow in the fifth decade of his professional life,\nHerbie Hancock remains where he has always been: in the\nforefront of world culture, technology, business and music.\nThough one can’t track exactly where he will go next, he is\nsure to leave his inimitable imprint wherever he lands.\nDANNY HILLIS\nWilliam Daniel “Danny” Hillis (born September 25, 1956,\nin Baltimore, Maryland) is an American inventor, scientist,\nengineer, entrepreneur, and author. He co-founded Thinking\nMachines Corporation, a company that developed the\nConnection Machine, a parallel supercomputer designed\nby Hillis at MIT. He is also co-founder of the Long Now\nFoundation, Applied Minds, Metaweb Technologies,\nApplied Proteomics, and author of The Pattern on the\nStone: The Simple Ideas That Make Computers Work.\nDanny Hillis was born in Baltimore, Maryland\nin 1956. His father, William Hillis, was a US Air Force\nepidemiologist studying hepatitis in Africa and relocated with\nhis family through Rwanda, Burundi, Republic of the Congo,\nand Kenya. He spent a brief part of his childhood in Calcutta,\nIndia when his father was a visiting faculty at ISI, Calcutta.\nDuring these years the young Hillis was home schooled by his\nmother Aryge Briggs Hillis, a biostatistician, and developed an\nearly appreciation for mathematics and biology. His younger\nbrother is David Hillis, a professor of evolutionary biology\nat the University of Texas at Austin, and his sister is Argye E.\nHillis, a professor of neurology at Johns Hopkins University.\nIn 1978 Hillis graduated from MIT with a BS degree\nin mathematics, followed in 1981 with an MS\ndegree in Electrical Engineering and Computer\nScience (EECS), specializing in robotics.\nDuring this time Hillis worked at the MIT Logo\nLaboratory developing computer hardware and software for\nchildren. He designed computer-oriented toys and games\nfor the Milton Bradley Company, and co-founded Terrapin\nSoftware—a producer of computer software for elementary\nschools. He also built a digital computer composed of\nTinkertoys that is on display at the Museum of Science, Boston.\nHillis’ major research, however, was into parallel\ncomputing. Hillis designed the Connection Machine, a\nparallel supercomputer; in 1983 Hillis co-founded Thinking\nMachines Corporation to produce and market supercomputers\nbased on this design. In 1988, continuing this research, Hillis\nreceived a PhD in EECS from MIT under doctoral advisers\nGerald Jay Sussman, Marvin Minsky and Claude Shannon.\nHillis co-founded Thinking Machines Corporation in\n1983 while doing his doctoral work at MIT. The company was\nto develop Hillis’ Connection Machine design into commercial\nparallel supercomputers, and to explore computational\npathways to building artificial intelligence. Hillis’ ambitions\nare represented by the company’s motto: “We’re building\na machine that will be proud of us,” and Hillis’ parallel\narchitecture was to be the main component for this task:\nClearly, the organizing principle of the brain is\nparallelism. It’s using massive parallelism. The information\nis in the connection between a lot of very simple parallel\nunits working together. So if we built a computer that was\nmore along that system of organization, it would likely\nbe able to do the same kinds of things the brain does.\nAt Thinking Machines Corporation, Hillis\nbuilt a technical team with many people that would\nlater become leaders in science and industry including\nBrewster Kahle, Guy Steele, Sydney Brenner, David\nWaltz, Jack Schwartz, and Eric Lander. He even recruited\nRichard Feynman to spend his summers there. For many\nyears, Thinking Machines Corporation connection\nmachines were the fastest computers in the world.\nDuring 1994, however, Thinking Machines filed for\nbankruptcy. In 1996, after a short stint as a professor at the MIT\nMedia Lab, Hillis joined The Walt Disney Company full time\nin the newly created role of Disney Fellow and Vice President,\nResearch and Development, Walt Disney Imagineering,\nwhich Hillis claimed was an early ambition of his:\nI’ve wanted to work at Disney ever since I was a\nchild…I remember listening to Walt Disney on television\ndescribing the ‘Imagineers’ who designed Disneyland.\nI decided then that someday I would be an Imagineer.\nLater, I became interested in a different kind of magic—\nthe magic of computers. Now I finally have the perfect\njob—bringing computer magic into Disney.\nAt Disney, Hillis developed new technologies as well\nas business strategies for Disney’s theme parks, television,\nmotion pictures, Internet and consumer products businesses.\nHe also designed new theme park rides, a full sized walking\nrobot dinosaur and various micro mechanical devices.\nHillis left Disney in 2000, taking with him Bran\nFerren, President of the Walt Disney Imagineering, R&D\nCreative Technologies division. Together, Ferren and Hillis\nfounded Applied Minds, a company aimed at providing\ntechnology and consulting services to firms in an array of\nindustries, including aerospace, electronics, and toys. In\nJuly 2005, Hillis and others from Applied Minds initiated\nMetaweb Technologies, Inc. to develop a semantic data storage\ninfrastructure for the Internet, and Freebase, an “open,\nshared database of the world’s knowledge”. When Metaweb\nwas acquired by Google, the technology became the basis\nof Google’s Knowledge Graph. Hillis, together with\nDr. David B. Agus, cofounded a spinoff of Applied Minds\ncalled Applied Proteomics Inc which designed and\nprototyped a machine that measures the level of proteins\nin the blood for medical diagnosis.\nHillis’ work with Agus on cancer led to the\nfounding of the University of Southern California\nPhysical Sciences-Oncology Center (USC PS-OC),\nfunded by the National Cancer Institute (NCI). Hillis\nis the principle investigator of this program.\nIn 1993, with Thinking Machines facing its demise,\nHillis wrote about long-term thinking and suggested a\nproject to build a clock designed to function for millennia:\nWhen I was a child, people used to talk about\nwhat would happen by the year 2000. Now, thirty years\nlater, they still talk about what will happen by the year\n2000. The future has been shrinking by one year per year\nfor my entire life. I think it is time for us to start a longterm\nproject that gets people thinking past the mental\nbarrier of the Millennium. I would like to propose a large\n(think Stonehenge) mechanical clock, powered by seasonal\ntemperature changes. It ticks once a year, bongs once a\ncentury, and the cuckoo comes out every millennium.\nThis clock became the Clock of the Long\nNow, a name invented by the songwriter and composer,\nBrian Eno. Hillis wrote an article for Wired magazine\nsuggesting a clock that would last over 10,000 years.\nThe project led directly to the founding of the Long Now\nFoundation in 1996 by Hillis and others, including Stewart\nBrand, Brian Eno, Esther Dyson, and Mitch Kapor.\nHillis asserts that parallelism itself is approximately\nthe main ingredient of intelligence; that there is not\nanything else required to make a mind result from a\ndistributed network of processors. Hillis believes that\n…intelligence is just a whole lot of little\nthings, thousands of them. And what will happen is\nwe’ll learn about each one at a time, and as we do it,\nmachines will be more and more like people. It will\nbe a gradual process, and that’s been happening.\nThis is not so different from Marvin Minsky’s Society\nof Mind theory, which holds that mind is a collection of agents,\neach one taking care of a particular aspect of intelligence,\nand communicating with one another, exchanging\ninformation as required.\nSome artificial intelligence theorists have other\nopinions—that it’s not the underlying computational\nmode that’s crucial, but rather particular algorithms\n(of reasoning, memory, perception, etc.). Others\nargue that the right combination of “little things” is\nneeded to give rise to the overall emergent patterns of\ncoordinated activity that constitute real intelligence.\nHillis is one of a small number of people\nwho have made a serious attempt to create such a\n“thinking machine” and his ambitions are clear:\n“I’d like to find a way for consciousness to\ntranscend human flesh. Building a thinking machine is\nreally a search for a kind of Earthly immortality. Something\nmuch more intelligent than we can exist. Making a\nthinking machine is my way to reach out to that.”\nHillis’ 1998 popular science book The Pattern on the\nStone attempts to explain concepts from computer science for\nlaymen using simple language, metaphor and analogy. It moves\nfrom Boolean algebra through topics such as information\ntheory, parallel computing, cryptography, algorithms,\nheuristics, Turing machines, and promising technologies\nsuch as quantum computing and emergent systems.\nBJARKE INGELS\nQUINCY JONES\nBjarke Ingels started BIG Bjarke Ingels Group in 2005 after\nco-founding PLOT Architects in 2001 and working at OMA\nin Rotterdam. Through a series of award-winning design\nprojects and buildings, Bjarke has developed a reputation\nfor designing buildings that are as programmatically\nand technically innovative as they are cost and resource\nconscious. Bjarke has received numerous awards and\nhonors, including the Danish Crown Prince’s Culture Prize\nin 2011, the Golden Lion at the Venice Biennale in 2004,\nand the ULI Award for Excellence in 2009. In 2011, the Wall\nStreet Journal awarded Bjarke the Architectural Innovator\nof the Year Award. In 2012, the American Institute of\nArchitects granted the 8 House its Honor Award, calling it\n“a complex and exemplary project of a new typology.”\nAlongside his architectural practice, Bjarke\ntaught at Harvard University, Yale University, Columbia\nUniversity, and Rice University and is an honorary professor\nat the Royal Academy of Arts, School of Architecture in\nCopenhagen. He is a frequent public speaker and has\nspoken in venues such as TED, WIRED, AMCHAM, 10\nDowning Street, and the World Economic Forum.\nAn impresario in the broadest and most creative sense\nof the word, Quincy Jones’ career has encompassed the\nroles of composer, record producer, artist, film producer,\narranger, conductor, instrumentalist, TV producer, record\ncompany executive, magazine founder, multi-media\nentrepreneur and humanitarian. As a master inventor of\nmusical hybrids, he has shuffled pop, soul, hip-hop, jazz,\nclassical, African and Brazilian music into many dazzling\nfusions, traversing virtually every medium, including\nrecords, live performance, movies and television.\nCelebrating more than 60 years performing and\nbeing involved in music, Quincy’s creative magic has spanned\nover six decades, beginning with the music of the postswing\nera and continuing through today’s high-technology,\ninternational multi-media hybrids. In the mid-50’s, he was\nthe first popular conductor-arranger to record with a Fender\nbass. His theme from the hit TV series Ironside was the first\nsynthesizer-based pop theme song. As the first black composer\nto be embraced by the Hollywood establishment in the 60’s,\nhe helped refresh movie music with badly needed infusions of\njazz and soul. His landmark 1989 album, Back On The Block—\nnamed “Album Of The Year” at the 1990 Grammy Awards—\nbrought such legends as Dizzy Gillespie, Ella Fitzgerald, Sarah\nVaughan and Miles Davis together with Ice T, Big Daddy Kane\nand Melle Mel to create the first fusion of the be bop and hip\nhop musical traditions; while his 1993 recording of the critically\nacclaimed Miles and Quincy Live At Montreux, featured\nQuincy conducting Miles Davis’ live performance of the\nhistoric Gil Evans arrangements from the Miles Ahead, Porgy\nand Bess and Sketches of Spain sessions, garnered a Grammy\nAward for Best Large Jazz Ensemble Performance. As producer\nand conductor of the historic “We Are The World” recording\n(the best-selling single of all time) and Michael Jackson’s\nmulti-platinum solo albums, Off The Wall, Bad and Thriller\n(the best selling album of all time, with over 50 million copies\nsold), Quincy Jones stands as one of the most successful and\nadmired creative artist/executives in the entertainment world.\nHis 1995 recording, Q’s Jook Joint, again showcased\nQuincy’s ability to mold the unique talents of an eclectic\ngroup of singers and musicians, in what resulted in a\nretrospective of his broad and diverse career from that of\na seasoned Jazz musician, to skilled composer, arranger,\nand bandleader, to acclaimed record producer.\nA reference to the backwoods club houses of rural\nAmerica in the 1930’s, 40’s, and 50’s, the platinum selling\nQ’s Jook Joint featured performances by artists such as\nBono, Brandy, Ray Charles, Phil Collins, Coolio, Kenny\n“Babyface” Edmonds, Gloria Estefan, Rachelle Ferrell, Aaron\nHall, Herbie Hancock, Heavy D., Ron Isley, Chaka Khan, R.\nKelly, Queen Latifah, Tone Loc, the Luniz, Brian McKnight,\nMelle Mel, Shaquille O’Neal, Joshua Redman, the Broadway\nmusical troupe Stomp, SWV, Take 6, newcomer Tamia,\nToots Thielemans, Mervyn Warren, Barry White, Warren\nWiebe, Charlie Wilson, Nancy Wilson, Stevie Wonder, Mr.\nX, and Yo-Yo, among others, and garnered seven Grammy\nnominations. His recording, From Q, With Love, featured a\ncollection of 26 love songs that he recorded over the last 32\nyears of his more than 50 year career in the music business.\nNamed by Time Magazine as one of the most\ninfluential jazz musicians of the 20th century, Quincy Jones\nwas born on March 14, 1933, in Chicago and brought up\nin Seattle. While in junior high school, he began studying\ntrumpet and sang in a gospel quartet at age 12. His musical\nstudies continued at the prestigious Berklee College of\nMusic in Boston, where he remained until the opportunity\narose to tour with Lionel Hampton’s band as a trumpeter,\narranger and sometime-pianist. He moved on to New York\nand the musical “big leagues” in 1951, where his reputation\nas an arranger grew. By the mid-50’s, he was arranging and\nrecording for such diverse artists as Sarah Vaughan, Ray\nCharles, Count Basie, Duke Ellington, Big Maybelle, Dinah\nWashington, Cannonball Adderly and LeVern Baker.\nIn 1957, Quincy decided to continue his musical\neducation by studying with Nadia Boulanger, the legendary\nParisian tutor to American expatriate composers such as\nLeonard Bernstein and Aaron Copeland. To subsidize\nhis studies he took a job with Barclay Disques, Mercury’s\nFrench distributor. Among the artists he recorded in Europe\nwere Charles Aznavour, Jacques Brel and Henri Salvador,\nas well as such visitors from America as Sarah Vaughan,\nBilly Eckstine and Andy Williams. Quincy’s love affair with\nEuropean audiences continues through the present: in 1991,\nhe began a continuing association with the Montreux Jazz\nand World Music Festival, which he serves as co-producer.\nQuincy won the first of his many Grammy’s in\n1963 for his Count Basie arrangement of “I Can’t Stop\nLoving You.” Quincy’s three-year musical association as\nconductor and arranger with Frank Sinatra in the mid-60’s\nalso teamed him with Basie for the classic Sinatra At The\nSands, containing the famous arrangement of “Fly Me To\nThe Moon,” the first recording played by astronaut Buzz\nAldrin when he landed upon the moon’s surface in 1969.\nWhen he became vice-president at Mercury Records\nin 1961, Quincy became the first high-level black executive\nof an established major record company. Toward the end of\nhis association with the label, Quincy turned his attention\nto another musical area that had been closed to blacks--the\nworld of film scores. In 1963, he started work on the music\nfor Sidney Lumet’s The Pawnbroker and it was the first of\nhis 33 major motion picture scores. In 1985, he co-produced\nSteven Spielberg’s adaptation of Alice Walker’s The Color\nPurple, which garnered eleven Oscar nominations, introduced\nWhoopi Goldberg and Oprah Winfrey to film audiences, and\nmarked Quincy’s debut as a film producer. In 1991 Quincy\nhelped launch NBC-TV’s hit series, The Fresh Prince Of\nBel Air, for which he served as an executive producer.\nIn 1990, Quincy Jones formed Quincy Jones\nEntertainment (QJE), a co-venture with Time Warner, Inc. The\nnew company, which Quincy served as CEO and chairman,\nhad a broad ranging, multi-media agenda which encompassed\nprogramming for current and future technologies, including\ntheatrical motion pictures and network, cable and syndicated\ntelevision. QJE produced NBC Television’s Fresh Prince Of\nBel Air (now in syndication), and UPN’s In The House and\nFox Television’s Mad TV, among other syndicated shows and\ntelevision specials. In 1991 Jones founded VIBE Magazine,\nand with his publishing group VIBE Ventures, would go on to\nacquire SPIN Magazine before divesting his magazine interests.\nIn January 1992, Quincy Jones executive produced\nthe An American Reunion concert at Lincoln Memorial,\nan all-star concert and celebration that was the first\nofficial event of the presidential inaugural celebration\nand drew widespread acclaim as an HBO telecast.\nOn March 25, 1996, Quincy Jones, executive\nproduced the most watched awards show in the\nworld, the 68th Annual Academy Awards. The show\nreceived widespread acclaim as one of the most\nmemorable Academy Award shows in recent years.\nIn 1997, Quincy Jones formed the Quincy Jones\nMedia Group. QJMG’s feature film projects in development\ninclude such highly anticipated films as the adaptations of the\nRalph Ellison novel Juneteeth, David Halberstam’s The Children\nfor Home Box Office in association with producers Kathleen\nKennedy and Frank Marshall, a bio-pic on the 19th century\nRussian poet Alexander Pushkin, Pimp and Seeds of Peace for\nShowtime, among others. For television, QJMG is developing\nthe sit-com The White Guy. QJMG is also active in live\nentertainment, direct response marketing, and cross-media\nprojects for home entertainment and educational applications.\nAs a record company executive, Quincy remained\nhighly active in the recording field throughout the 1990s as the\nguiding force behind his own Qwest Records, which boasted\nsuch important artists as New Order, Tevin Campbell, Andre\nCrouch, Patti Austin, James Ingram, Siedah Garrett, Gregory\nJefferson and Justin Warfield.

Diller\nmoved Katzenberg to the marketing department, followed\nby other assignments within the studio, until he was\nassigned to revive the Star Trek franchise, which resulted\nin the hit film, Star Trek: The Motion Picture (1979). He\ncontinued to work his way up and became President of\nProduction under Paramount President Michael Eisner.\nIn 1984, Michael Eisner became Chief Executive\nOfficer (CEO) at The Walt Disney Company.

After receiving his B.A. and M.A. degrees\nfrom Columbia University in 1972, he obtained an M.D.\nand Ph.D. in Neuroanatomy and Computer Science from\nGeorgetown University in 1977. Following an internship at\nGeorgetown, he completed Neurology and Nuclear Medicine\ntraining at UCLA and joined the faculty here in 1983.\nDr. Mazziotta chairs one of the nation’s largest\nNeurology departments, which for nine of the last ten\nyears achieved the distinguished position of being first in\nNational Institutes of Health (NIH) research funding. An\nexpert in brain imaging, he established the Brain Mapping\nCenter at UCLA that includes all of the methods available\nto study human brain structure and function. He was the\nprincipal investigator of the International Consortium for\nBrain Mapping, whose goal is to develop the first atlas of\nthe human brain that will include behavioral, demographic,\nimaging, and genetic data from 7,000 subjects.\nSince beginning this work, Dr. Mazziotta has\npublished more than 255 research papers and eight texts.\nHe has received numerous awards and honors, including\nthe Oldendorf Award from the American Society of\nNeuroimaging, the S. Weir Mitchell Award and the\nWartenberg Prize of the American Academy of Neurology,\nthe Von Hevesy Prize from the International Society\nof Nuclear Medicine, the 1996 Medical Science Award\nfrom the UCLA Medical Alumni Association, election\nto the Institute of Medicine of the National Academy of\nSciences, Honorary Doctorate from l’Université de Caen\nand membership in the Royal College of Physicians.\nIn January 2012, Dr. Mazziotta was appointed\nAssociate Vice Chancellor for Medical Sciences and Executive\nVice Dean of the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA.\nNicholas Negroponte (born December 1, 1943) is an\nAmerican architect best known as the founder and\nChairman Emeritus of Massachusetts Institute of\nTechnology’s Media Lab, and also known as the founder\nof the One Laptop per Child Association (OLPC).\nNegroponte was born to Dimitri John Negroponte,\na Greek shipping magnate, and grew up in New York\nCity’s Upper East Side. He is the younger brother of John\nNegroponte, former United States Deputy Secretary of State.\nHe attended Buckley School in New York City, Le\nRosey in Switzerland, and The Choate School (now Choate\nRosemary Hall) in Wallingford, Connecticut, from which he\ngraduated in 1961. Subsequently, he studied at MIT as both\nan undergraduate and graduate student in Architecture where\nhis research focused on issues of computer-aided design. He\nearned a Master’s degree in architecture from MIT in 1966.\nNegroponte joined the faculty of MIT in 1966.\nFor several years thereafter he divided his teaching time\nbetween MIT and several visiting professorships at Yale,\nMichigan and the University of California, Berkeley.\nIn 1967, Negroponte founded MIT’s Architecture\nMachine Group, a combination lab and think tank which\nstudied new approaches to human-computer interaction.\nIn 1985, Negroponte created the MIT Media Lab with\nJerome B. Wiesner. As director, he developed the lab into\nthe pre-eminent computer science laboratory for new\nmedia and a high-tech playground for investigating the\nhuman-computer interface. Negroponte also became a\nproponent of intelligent agents and personalized electronic\nnewspapers, for which he popularized the term the Daily Me.\nIn 1992, Negroponte became involved in the creation\nof Wired Magazine as the first investor. From 1993 to 1998,\nhe contributed a monthly column to the magazine in which\nhe reiterated a basic theme: “Move bits, not atoms.”\nNegroponte expanded many of the ideas from his\nWired columns into a bestselling book Being Digital (1995),\nwhich made famous his forecasts on how the interactive\nworld, the entertainment world and the information world\nwould eventually merge. Being Digital was a bestseller and\nwas translated into some twenty languages. Negroponte\nis a digital optimist who believed that computers would\nmake life better for everyone. However, critics such as\nCass Sunstein have faulted his techno-utopian ideas for\nfailing to consider the historical, political and cultural\nrealities with which new technologies should be viewed.\nNegroponte’s belief that wired technologies such\nas telephones will ultimately become unwired by using\nairwaves instead of wires or fiber optics, and that unwired\ntechnologies such as televisions will become wired, is\ncommonly referred to as the Negroponte switch.\nIn 2000, Negroponte stepped down as director\nof the Media Lab as Walter Bender took over as Executive\nDirector. However, Negroponte retained the role of laboratory\nChairman. When Frank Moss was appointed director of the lab\nin 2006, Negroponte stepped down as lab chairman to focus\nmore fully on his work with One Laptop Per Child (OLPC)\nalthough he retains his appointment as professor at MIT.\nIn November 2005, at the World Summit on the\nInformation Society held in Tunis, Negroponte unveiled the\nconcept of a $100 laptop computer, The Children’s Machine,\ndesigned for students in the developing world. The price\nhas increased to US$180, however. The project is part of\na broader program by One Laptop Per Child, a non-profit\norganisation started by Negroponte and other Media Lab\nfaculty, to extend Internet access in developing countries.\nNegroponte is an active angel investor and has\ninvested in over 30 startup companies over the last 30 years,\nincluding Zagats, Wired, Ambient Devices, Skype and Velti.\nHe sits on several boards, including Motorola (listed on the\nNew York Stock Exchange) and Velti (listed on the London\nStock Exchange and the NASDAQ). He is also on the advisory\nboard of TTI/Vanguard. In August 2007, he was appointed\nto a five-member special committee with the objective of\nassuring the continued journalistic and editorial integrity\nand independence of the Wall Street Journal and other Dow\nJones & Company publications and services. The committee\nwas formed as part of the merger of Dow Jones with News\nCorporation. Negroponte’s fellow founding committee\nmembers are Louis Boccardi, Thomas Bray, Jack Fuller,\nand the late former Congresswoman Jennifer Dunn.\nNegroponte has influenced modern\nday futurists, such as David Houle.\n\nTODD OLDHAM\nTodd is a well-known designer whose career spans more\nthan 20 years. Distinguished as an innovator of accessible\ndesign, Todd Oldham is the founder of Todd Oldham Studio,\na multifaceted, full-service design studio based in NYC.\nOriginally a New York fashion designer, the host\nof “Todd Time” on MTV’s House of Style, Todd’s career has\nevolved to include all areas of design, from interior design,\nfilm and photography, to furniture and graphic design.\nTodd is currently working on his 19th book Charley\nHarper’s Animal Kingdom.

He earned a bachelor’s\ndegree in experimental psychology at McGill University and\nthen moved to Cambridge, Massachusetts in 1976, where he\nhas spent most of his career bouncing back and forth between\nHarvard and MIT. He earned his doctorate at Harvard in 1979,\nfollowed by a postdoctoral fellowship at MIT, a one-year stint\nas an assistant professor at Harvard, and in 1982, a move back\nto MIT that lasted until 2003, when he returned to Harvard.\nCurrently he is Harvard College Professor and the Johnstone\nFamily Professor in the Department of Psychology. He also\nhas spent two years in California: in 1981–82, when he was an\nassistant professor at Stanford, and in 1995–96,when he spent\na sabbatical year at the University of California, Santa Barbara.\nPinker is an experimental psychologist who is\ninterested in all aspects of language and mind. Much of his\ninitial research was in visual cognition, the ability to imagine\nshapes, recognize faces and objects, and direct attention within\nthe visual field. But beginning in graduate school he cultivated\nan interest in language, particularly language development\nin children, and this topic eventually took over his research\nactivities. Aside from his experimental papers in language and\nvisual cognition, he wrote two fairly technical books early in\nhis career. One outlined a theory of how children acquire the\nwords and grammatical structures of their mother tongue. The\nsecond focused on one aspect of this process, the ability to\nuse different kinds of verbs in appropriate sentences, such as\nintransitive verbs, transitive verbs, and verbs taking different\ncombinations of complements and indirect objects. For the\nnext two decades his research focused on the distinction\nbetween irregular verbs like bring-brought and regular\nverbs like walk-walked. The reason is that the two kinds of\nverbs neatly embody the two processes that make language\npossible: looking up words in memory, and combining words\n(or parts of words) according to rules. He has also studied\nlanguage development in twins and the neuroimaging of\nlanguage processes in the brain, and has recently begun\nlines of research on the nature of reminding and on the\nfunction of innuendo and other forms of indirect speech.\nIn 1994 he published the first of five books\nwritten for a general audience. The Language Instinct was\nan introduction to all aspects of language, held together by\nthe idea that language is a biological adaptation. This was\nfollowed in 1997 by How the Mind Works, which offered a\nsimilar synthesis of the rest of the mind, from vision and\nreasoning to the emotions, humor, and art. In 1999 he\npublished Words and Rules: The Ingredients of Language which\npresented his research on regular and irregular verbs as a\nway of explaining how language works in general. In 2002\nhe published The Blank Slate: The Modern Denial of Human\nNature, which explored the political, moral, and emotional\ncolorings of the concept of human nature. The Stuff of Thought:\nLanguage as a Window into Human Nature, published in 2007,\ndiscussed the ways in which language reveals our thoughts,\nemotions, and social relationships. His most recent book is\nThe Better Angels of Our Nature: Why Violence Has Declined,\npublished in 2011. Pinker frequently writes for The New York\nTimes, Time, The New Republic, and other magazines on\nsubjects such as language and politics, the neural basis of\nconsciousness, and the genetic enhancement of human beings.\nPinker is the Chair of the Usage Panel of The\nAmerican Heritage Dictionary and has served as editor or\nadvisor for numerous scientific, scholarly, media, and\nhumanist organizations, including the American Association\nthe Advancement of Science, the National Science Foundation,\nthe American Academy of Arts and Sciences, the American\nPsychological Association, and the Linguistics Society of\nAmerica. He has won many prizes for his books (including\nthe William James Book Prize three times, the Los Angeles\nTimes Science Book Prize, and the Eleanor Maccoby Book\nPrize), his research (including the Troland Research Prize\nfrom the National Academy of Sciences, the Early Career\nAward from the American Psychological Association, and\nthe Henry Dale Prize from the Royal Institution of Great\nBritain), and his graduate and undergraduate teaching.\nHe is also a Humanist Laureate, the 2006 Humanist of\nthe Year, recipient of the 2008 Innovations for Humanity\nAward from La Ciudad de las Ideas in Mexico, the 2008\nHonorary President of the Canadian Psychological\nAssociation, and the recipient of six honorary doctorates.\nPinker lives in Boston and in Truro\nwith Rebecca Newberger Goldstein. The other\nauthors in the family are his sister Susan Pinker\nand Rebecca’s daughter Yael Goldstein Love.\nLISA RANDALL\nProfessor Lisa Randall studies theoretical particle physics\nand cosmology at Harvard University. Her research\nconnects theoretical insights to puzzles in our current\nunderstanding of the properties and interactions of\nmatter. She has developed and studied a wide variety of\nmodels to address these questions, the most prominent\ninvolving extra dimensions of space. Her work has\ninvolved improving our under-standing of the Standard\nModel of particle physics, supersymmetry, baryogenesis,\ncosmological inflation, and dark matter. Randall’s research\nalso explores ways to experimentally test and verify ideas\nand her current research focuses in large part on the Large\nHadron Collider and dark matter searches and models.\nRandall has also had a public presence through her\nwriting, lectures, and radio and TV appearances. Randall’s\nbooks, Warped Passages: Unraveling the Mysteries of the Universe’s\nHidden Dimensions and Knocking on Heaven’s Door: How\nPhysics and Scientific Thinking Illuminate the Universe and the\nModern World were both on The New York Times’ list of 100\nNotable Books of the Year. Higgs Discovery: The Power of Empty\nSpace was released as a Kindle Single in the summer of 2012\nas an update with recent particle physics developments.\nRandall’s studies have made her among the most\ncited and influential theoretical physicists and she has received\nnumerous awards and honors for her scientific endeavors.\nShe is a member of the National Academy of Sciences, the\nAmerican Philosophical Society, the American Academy of\nArts and Sciences, was a fellow of the American Physical\nSociety, and is a past winner of an Alfred P.

Embracing a comprehensive and\nhumane design philosophy, Safdie is committed to\narchitecture that supports and enhances a project’s\nprogram; that is informed by the geographic, social, and\ncultural elements that define a place; and that responds to\nhuman needs and aspirations. Safdie has completed a wide\nrange of projects, such as cultural, educational, and civic\ninstitutions; neighborhoods and public parks; mixed-use\nurban centers and airports; and master plans for existing\ncommunities and entirely new cities around the world.\nMajor projects by Safdie Architects currently under\nconstruction or recently completed include Mamilla Alrov\nCenter, a dynamic urban center near the Old City in Jerusalem;\nMarina Bay Sands, a mixed-use integrated resort in Singapore;\nKhalsa Heritage Memorial Complex, the national museum\nof the Sikh people in the Punjab, India; the United States\nInstitute of Peace Headquarters on the Mall in Washington,\nD.C.; the National Campus for the Archeology of Israel in\nJerusalem; Golden Dream Bay, a high-density residential\nproject in Qinhuangdao, China; the Kauffman Center for the\nPerforming Arts in Kansas City, Missouri; and the Crystal\nBridges Museum of American Art in Bentonville, Arkansas.\nBorn in Haifa, Israel, in 1938, Safdie moved to\nCanada with his family at a young age. He graduated from\nMcGill University in 1961 with a degree in architecture.\nAfter apprenticing with Louis I. Kahn in Philadelphia, Safdie\nreturned to Montreal to oversee the master plan for the\n1967 World Exhibition. In 1964 he established his own firm\nto realize Habitat ’67, an adaptation of his thesis at McGill,\nwhich was the central feature of the World’s Fair and a\ngroundbreaking design in the history of architecture.\nIn 1970, Safdie established a Jerusalem branch office,\ncommencing an intense involvement with the rebuilding of\nJerusalem. He was responsible for major segments of the\nrestoration of the Old City and the reconstruction of the new\ncenter, linking the Old and New Cities. Over the years, his\ninvolvement expanded and included the new city of Modi’in,\nthe new Yad Vashem Holocaust Museum, and the Rabin\nMemorial Center. During this period, Safdie also became\ninvolved in the developing world, working in Senegal, Iran,\nSingapore, and in the northern Canadian arctic. In 1978,\nafter teaching at Yale, McGill, and Ben Gurion Universities,\nSafdie relocated his residence and principal office to Boston.\nHe served as Director of the Urban Design Program at\nHarvard University Graduate School of Design from 1978 to\n1984, and Ian Woodner Professor of Architecture and Urban\nDesign from 1984 to 1989.

His professional life started at age 18 in a\n250-square-foot (23 m 2 ) store in Cologne, Germany, named\nTASCHEN COMICS. In 1984, he bought 40,000 remainder\ncopies of a Magritte monograph published in English with\nmoney borrowed from his family. The books sold through at\ndouble the price in two months and he was soon publishing\nhis own books. By the end of the 1980s TASCHEN titles\nwere available in over a dozen languages at prices that made\nart books affordable to students and collectors alike.\nBy the late 1990s, he had become a household\nname in publishing. When Vanity Fair’s Matt Tyrnauer\ndeemed him, “one of the few people in business who has the\ncourage to do exactly what he wants whenever he wants to”,\nBenedikt Taschen tested the theory with Helmut Newton’s\nSUMO, the largest bound book of the 20th century. “I have\ndone a lot of books, and I can tell you—without mentioning\nnames—that publishers are not all like him.

Like Yeats and Lowell\nbefore him, he writes from the borderland between private\nand public life….[His poems] join skeptical intelligence\nand emotional sincerity, in a way that dignifies all of our\nattempts to make sense of the world and of ourselves.

Still, “rival,” “victim, “will”—don’t such anthropomorphic terms\nmake those simians’ social-political conflicts sound more brutal than they are?\nThe chimps Catherine and I saw on their island sanctuary in Uganda we loathed.\nUnlike the pacific gorillas in the forest of Bwindi, they fought, dementedly shrieked,\nthe dominant male lorded it over the rest; they were, in all, too much like us.\nAnother island from my recent reading, where Columbus, on his last voyage,\nencountering some “Indians” who’d greeted him with curiosity and warmth, wrote,\nbefore he chained and enslaved them, “They don’t even know how to kill each other.”\nIt’s occurred to me I’ve read enough—at my age all it does is confirm my sadness.\nSurely the papers: war, terror, torture, corruption—they’re like broken glass in the mind.\nBack when I knew I knew nothing, I read all the time, poems, novels, philosophy, myth,\nbut I hardly glanced at the news, there was a distance between what could happen\nand the part of myself I felt with: now everything’s so tight against me I hardly can move.\nThe Analects say people in the golden age weren’t aware they were governed; they just\nlived.\nCould I have passed through my own golden age and not even known I was there?\nSome gold: nuclear rockets aimed at your head, racism, sexism, contempt for the poor.\nAnd there I was, reading. What did I learn? Everything, nothing, too little, too much…\nJust enough to get me here: a long-faced, white-haired ape with a book, still turning the\npage.\nC. K.

In May 1999, he starred as Prince Siegfried in Peter\nMartins’ Swan Lake on the PBS national telecast “Live from\nLincoln Center.” Woetzel also appeared in the 2002 nationally\ntelevised Live from Lincoln Center broadcast “New York City\nBallet’s Diamond Project: Ten Years of New Choreography”\non PBS and in the May 2004 Live from Lincoln Center\nbroadcast of “Lincoln Center Celebrates Balanchine 100.”\nWoetzel starred as the Cavalier in the film version of George\nBalanchine’s The Nutcracker™, released in the winter of 1993.\nDuring his career, Woetzel frequently performed\ninternationally as a guest star and was a visiting artist\nwith numerous companies including the Kirov Ballet\nand American Ballet Theatre. In his guest appearances,\nWoetzel danced principal roles in classics such as Don\nQuixote, Giselle, and La Bayadere, among others.\nWoetzel has choreographed a number of ballets\nfor New York City Ballet, among other companies. For New\nYork City Ballet, he choreographed Ebony Concerto to\nStravinsky, and Glazounov Pas de Deux to the composer’s\nLes Ruses d’Amour. Woetzel also choreographed the\n“Polovtsian Dances” for New York City Opera’s production\nof Prince Igor, and in 1998, he choreographed and\nstarred in a new version of An American in Paris ballet\nfor Marvin Hamlisch’s Gershwin Centennial Gala.\nWoetzel is the recipient of a Choo San Goh award\nfor new choreography. He serves on the Artists Committee\nof the Kennedy Center Honors and as a judge for the Astaire\nAwards. He has also served as a juror for the Princess Grace\nAwards. Woetzel is a frequent speaker on the arts and arts\npolicy. Woetzel was the 2008 Harman-Eisner Artist in\nResidence of the Aspen Institute, and in 2011, he became a\nmember of the Knight Foundation’s National Arts Advisory\nCommittee. Woetzel also serves on the boards of directors\nof New York City Center, The Clive Barnes Foundation and\nThe Sphinx Organization, and served on the recent Harvard\nTask Force on the Arts. In November 2009, President\nObama appointed Woetzel to the President’s Committee\non the Arts and Humanities. In July 2012, Woetzel was\nhonored with the inaugural Gene Kelly Legacy Award—an\naward jointly created by the Dizzy Feet Foundation and\nthe Estate of Gene Kelly in honor of the 100th anniversary\nof Kelly’s birth—for his contributions to the arts as a ballet\nstar and director of dance and music performances.\nWoetzel holds a Master in Public Administration\nDegree from Harvard’s Kennedy School of Government.\nWoetzel has been married to\nHeather Watts since 1999.\nSTEPHEN WOLFRAM\nWILL WRIGHT\nStephen Wolfram has been responsible for three\nrevolutionary developments: the Mathematica\ncomputation system, A New Kind of Science, and the\nWolfram|Alpha computational knowledge engine.\nWolfram was educated at Eton, Oxford and\nCaltech, receiving his Ph.D. in theoretical physics at the\nage of 20. Wolfram’s work on basic science led him to a\nseries of fundamental discoveries about the computational\nuniverse of possible programs. Summarized in his bestselling\n2002 book A New Kind of Science, these discoveries\nhave not only launched major new directions in basic\nresearch, but have also led to breakthroughs in scientific\nmodeling in physical, biological and social domains—as well\nas defining a broad new basis for technology discovery.\nLaunched in 1988, Mathematica has revolutionized\nthe way technical computation is done, and has been\nresponsible for countless advances over the past two decades.\nStarting from a set of fundamental principles devised by\nWolfram, Mathematica has continually grown, integrating\nmore and more algorithmic domains, and spawning such\ntechnologies as the Computable Document Format (CDF).\nBuilding on Mathematica and A New Kind of\nScience, Wolfram in 2009 launched Wolfram|Alpha—an\nambitious, long-term project to make as much of the world’s\nknowledge as possible computable, and accessible to\neveryone. Used every day on the web and through apps by\nmillions of people around the world, Wolfram|Alpha defines\na fundamentally new kind of computing platform that is\nturning science-fiction computer intelligence into reality.\nIn addition to his scientific and technical\nachievements, Wolfram has been the CEO of Wolfram\nResearch since its founding in 1987. Under Wolfram’s\nleadership, Wolfram Research has become one of the world’s\nmost respected software companies, as well as a powerhouse\nof technical and intellectual innovation, and a major\ncontributor to education and research around the world.\nWilliam Ralph “Will” Wright (born January 20, 1960, in\nAtlanta, Georgia) is an American video game designer and\nco-founder of the game development company Maxis, now\npart of Electronic Arts. In April 2009, he left Electronic\nArts to run “Stupid Fun Club”, an entertainment think\ntank in which Wright and EA are principal shareholders.\nThe first computer game Wright designed was\nRaid on Bungeling Bay in 1984, but it was SimCity that\nbrought him to prominence. The game was released by\nMaxis, a company Wright formed with Jeff Braun, and he\nbuilt upon the game’s theme of computer simulation with\nnumerous other titles including SimEarth and SimAnt.\nWright’s greatest success to date came as the original\ndesigner for The Sims games series. The game spawned\nmultiple sequels and expansions and Wright earned many\nawards for his work. His latest work, Spore, was released\nin September 2008 and features gameplay based upon the\nmodel of evolution and scientific advancement. The game\nsold 406,000 copies within three weeks of its release.\nHe was born as William Ralph Wright\non January 20, 1960, in Atlanta. He is of French,\nEnglish, Italian, and Native American descent.\nAfter graduating at 16 from Episcopal High School,\nhe enrolled in Louisiana State University, transferring two\nyears later to Louisiana Tech. Beginning with a start at an\narchitecture degree, followed by mechanical engineering,\nhe fell into computers and robotics. He excelled in subjects\nhe was interested in—architecture, economics, mechanical\nengineering, and military history—but was held back by his\nimpractical goals such as language arts. His earlier dream\nof space colonization remained, and was joined by a love\nfor robotics. After another two years at Louisiana Tech, in\nthe fall of 1980, Wright moved on to The New School in\nManhattan. He lived in an apartment over Balducci’s, in\nGreenwich Village, and spent his spare time searching for\nspare parts in local electronics surplus stores. After one year\nat the New School, Wright returned to Baton Rouge without\nhis degree, concluding five years of collegiate study.\nDuring a summer break from college, he\nmet his first wife Joell Jones, an artist currently living\nin California, on vacation to her hometown of Baton\nRouge. In an interview published in February 2003, Will\nclaims that games were absorbing so much of his time,\nhe decided that perhaps making games was the way to\ngo. Wright’s first game was the helicopter action game\nRaid on Bungeling Bay (1984) for the Commodore 64.\nWright found that he had more fun creating levels\nwith his level editor for Raid on Bungeling Bay than he had\nwhile actually playing the game. He created a new game\nthat would later evolve into SimCity, but he had trouble\nfinding a publisher. The structuralist dynamics of the game\nwere in part inspired by the work of two architectural and\nurban theorists, Christopher Alexander and Jay Forrester.\n“I’m interested in the process and strategies\nfor design. The architect Christopher Alexander, in\nhis book A Pattern Language formalized a lot of spatial\nrelationships into a grammar for design. I’d really like to\nwork toward a grammar for complex systems and present\nsomeone with tools for designing complex things.”\nWright, in an interview with The Times,\nexpressed belief that computers extend the imagination,\nand posits the emergence of the “metabrain”, stating:\n“Any human institutional system that draws\non the intelligence of all its members is a metabrain. Up\nto now, we have had high friction between the neurons\nof the metabrain; technology is lowering that friction\ntremendously. Computers are allowing us to aggregate our\nintelligence in ways that were never possible before. If you\nlook at Spore, people are making this stuff, and computers\ncollect it, then decide who to send it to. The computer is\nthe broker. What they are really exploring is the collective\ncreativity of millions of people. They are aggregating\nhuman intelligence into a system that is more powerful\nthan we thought artificial intelligence was going to be.”\nIn 1986, he met Jeff Braun, an investor interested\nin entering the computer game industry, at what Wright\ncalls “the world’s most important pizza party.” Together\nthey formed Maxis the next year in Orinda, California.\nSimCity (1989) was a hit and has been credited as one of\nthe most influential computer games ever made. Wright\nhimself has been widely featured in several computer\nmagazines—particularly PC Gamer, which has listed\nWright in its annual ‘Game Gods’ feature, alongside such\nnotables as Roberta Williams and Peter Molyneux.\nFollowing the success of SimCity, Wright\ndesigned SimEarth (1990) and SimAnt (1991). He codesigned\nSimCity 2000 (1993) with Fred Haslam and\nin the meantime Maxis produced other “Sim” games.\nWright’s next game was SimCopter (1996). Although\nnone of these games were as successful as SimCity, they\nfurther cemented Wright’s reputation as a designer of\n“software toys”—games that cannot be won or lost. In 1992,\nWright and his family moved to Orinda, California.\nWright has a great interest in complex adaptive\nsystems and most of his games have been based around\nthem or books that describe them (SimAnt: E.O. Wilson’s\nThe Ants, SimEarth: James Lovelock’s Gaia Theory, SimCity:\nJay Forrester’s Urban Dynamics and World Dynamics, Spore:\nDrake’s Equation and The Powers of Ten) Wright’s role in the\ndevelopment of the concepts from simulations to games is\nto empower the players by creating what he dubs “possibility\nspaces”, or simple rules and game elements that add up to a\nvery complex design. All Maxis, and later games that Wright\nhad a hand in designing, adhere to these design principles.\nMaxis went public in 1995 with revenue of US$38\nmillion. The stock reached $50 a share and then dropped\nas Maxis posted a loss. Electronic Arts bought Maxis in\nJune 1997. Wright had been thinking about making a virtual\ndoll house ever since the early 1990s, similar to SimCity\nbut focused on individual people. Originally conceived\nof as an architectural design game called Home Tactics,\nWright’s idea changed when someone suggested the player\nshould be rated on the quality of life experience by the\nhomeowners. It was a difficult idea to sell to E.A., because\nalready 40% of Maxis’s employees had been laid off.\nWhen Wright took his idea to the Maxis board of\ndirectors, Jeff Braun says, “The board looked at The Sims\nand said, ‘What is this? He wants to do an interactive doll\nhouse? The guy is out of his mind.’ ” Doll houses were for girls,\nand girls didn’t play video games. Maxis gave little support\nor financing for the game. Electronic Arts, which bought\nMaxis in 1997, was more enthusiastic. Wright’s games are so\ndifferent from E.A.’s other releases that it was hard to imagine\nthe two being united in the same enterprise. But the success\nof SimCity had already established Sim as a strong brand,\nand E.A., which by then, fifteen years after its founding, was\nbecoming a Procter & Gamble-style brand-management\ncompany, foresaw the possibility of building a Sim franchise.\nE.A. published The Sims in February 2000\nand it became Wright’s biggest success yet. It eventually\nsurpassed Myst as the best-selling computer game of all\ntime and spawned numerous expansion packs and other\ngames. He designed a massively multiplayer version\nof the game called The Sims Online, which was not as\npopular as the original. By November 2006, The Sims\nfranchise had earned E.A. more than a billion dollars.\nIn a presentation at the Game Developers Conference\non March 11, 2005, he announced his latest game Spore.\nHe used the current work on this game to demonstrate\nmethods that can be used to reduce the amount of content\nthat needs to be created by the game developers. Wright\nhopes to inspire others to take risks in game creation.\nAs for his theories on interactive\ndesign, Wright says the following:\n“Well, one thing I’ve always really enjoyed is making\nthings. Out of whatever. It started with modeling as a kid,\nbuilding models. When computers came along, I started\nlearning programming and realizing the computer was this\ngreat tool for making things, making models, dynamic models,\nand behaviors, not just static models. I think when I started\ndoing games I really wanted to carry that to the next step, to\nthe player, so that you give the player a tool so that they can\ncreate things. And then you give them some context for that\ncreation. You know, what is it, what kind of kind of world\ndoes it live in, what’s its purpose? What are you trying to do\nwith this thing that you’re creating? To really put the player\nin the design role. And the actual world is reactive to their\ndesign. So they design something that the little world inside\nthe computer reacts to. And then they have to revisit the\ndesign and redesign it, or tear it down and build another one,\nwhatever it is. So I guess what really draws me to interactive\nentertainment and the thing that I try to keep focused on is\nenabling the creativity of the player. Giving them a pretty large\nsolution space to solve the problem within the game. So the\ngame represents this problem landscape. Most games have\nsmall solution landscapes, so there’s one possible solution and\none way to solve it. Other games, the games that tend to be\nmore creative, have a much larger solution space, so you can\npotentially solve this problem in a way that nobody else has. If\nyou’re building a solution, how large that solution space is gives\nthe player a much stronger feeling of empathy. If they know\nthat what they’ve done is unique to them, they tend to care for\nit a lot more. I think that’s the direction I tend to come from.”\nWright believes that simulations as games\ncan be used to improve education by teaching\nchildren how to learn. In his own words:\n“The problem with our education system is we’ve\ntaken this kind of narrow, reductionist, Aristotelian approach\nto what learning is. It’s not designed for experimenting\nwith complex systems and navigating your way through\nthem in an intuitive way, which is what games teach. It’s not\nreally designed for failure, which is also something games\nteach. I mean, I think that failure is a better teacher than\nsuccess. Trial and error, reverse-engineering stuff in your\nmind—all the ways that kids interact with games—that’s\nthe kind of thinking schools should be teaching. And I\nwould argue that as the world becomes more complex, and\nas outcomes become less about success or failure, games\nare better at preparing you. The education system is going\nto realize this sooner or later. It’s starting. Teachers are\nentering the system who grew up playing games. They’re\ngoing to want to engage with the kids using games.”\nWright will appear as a character in the video game\nMr. T, where he will team up with Mr. T to fight Nazis.\nWright was given a “Lifetime Achievement\nAward” at the Game Developers Choice Awards in 2001.\nIn 2002, he became the fifth person to be inducted into the\nAcademy of Interactive Arts and Sciences’ Hall of Fame.\nUntil 2006, he was the only person to have been honored\nthis way by both of these industry organizations. In 2007\nthe British Academy of Film and Television Arts awarded\nhim a fellowship, the first given to a game designer.\nHe has been called one of the most important\npeople in gaming, technology, and entertainment by\npublications such as Entertainment Weekly, Time, PC Gamer,\nDiscover and GameSpy. Wright was also awarded the PC\nMagazine Lifetime Achievement Award in January 2005.\nIn 1980, along with co-driver and race organizer\nRick Doherty, Wright participated in the U.S. Express,\na cross-country race that was the predecessor to The\nCannonball Run. Wright and Doherty drove a specially\noutfitted Mazda RX-7 from Brooklyn, New York to Santa\nMonica, California in 33:39, winning the illegal race. Wright\nonly competed once in the race, which continued until 1983.\nSince 2003, in his spare time, Wright has collected\nleftovers from the Soviet space program, “including a\n100-pound hatch from a space shuttle, a seat from a\nSoyuz… control panels from the Mir”, and the control\nconsole of the Soyuz 23, as well as dolls, dice, and\nfossils. During E3 2004 he passed off an old lapel pin\ncommemorating the Soviet space program to a reporter.\n“I’m uncollecting. I buy collections on eBay, and I\ndisperse them out to people again. I have to be like an entropic\nforce to collectors, otherwise all of this stuff will get sorted.”\nHe once built competitive robots for BattleBots\nwith his daughter, but no longer does so. As of November\n2006, Wright still had remnant bits of machined metal left\nover from his BattleBots days strewn about the garage of his\nOakland home. Wright was a former Robot Wars champion\nin the Berkeley-based robotics workshop, the Stupid Fun\nClub. One of Wright’s bots, designed with the help of Wright’s\ndaughter Cassidy, “Kitty Puff Puff ”, fought against its\nopponents by sticking a roll of gauze onto its armature and\ncircling around them, encapsulating them and denying them\nmovement. The technique, cocooning, was eventually banned.\nFollowing his work in BattleBots, he has taken\nsteps into the field of human-robot interactions.\n“We build these robots and we take them down to\nBerkeley and study the interactions that people have with\nthe robots,” says Wright. “We built this newer one that has a\nrapid-fire pingpong cannon. It will fire about 10 per second.\nSo we give people this plastic bat and we say, ‘It’s set up to\nplay baseball. Do you want to play baseball? It’s going to\nshoot a little ball and you try to hit it.’ And all of a sudden\nit’s like da-da-da-da, and it’s pelting them with balls.”\nAfter building his reputation as one of the most\nimportant game designers in the world, Wright in 2009\nleft Maxis, the Electronic Arts owned studio he founded.\nHis first post-E.A. venture was the Stupid Fun Club.\nIn October 2010, Current TV announced that\nWill Wright will produce a new show for the network. The\nprogram, entitled Bar Karma, began airing in February 2011.\nIn October 2011, Will Wright became\na member of the Board of Directors of Linden\nLab, the creators of Second Life.\nJOSHUA WURMAN\nI grew up in Pennsylvania, bereft of any really meaningful\nopportunities to experience severe weather, hurricanes, even\nreal deep snow. As a youth, I tried to impress friends and\ngirls with my home weather station and insect collection.\nThese efforts, among other factors, kept me well out of the\nrunning for homecoming king. Naturally, I moved on to a\nparty school, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT)\nto search for a better social life. But hating schoolwork, I\nrushed through it, earning my MS at only 21. Then after some\naimless additional years in school I dropped out for three\nyears, working for the Air Force on nuclear winter computer\nsimulations and other cheery subjects. Returning to MIT,\nI earned my Doctorate and moved to Colorado to work at\nthe National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) on\nbistatic radar networks, a new type of weather radar system\nthat I had invented. However, after seeing real High Plains\nthunderstorms close up, and tornadoes, I got distracted\nand conceived of building a network of big, fast scanning\nradars that could drive right up to tornadoes and fires, inside\nhurricanes, and into other nice weather. The DOW program\nwas born, and I moved down to Oklahoma to be a professor\nfor a few years, chase tornadoes and hurricanes, file patents,\nteach and write papers. In the middle of this, I traveled to Asia\non a research project and met my wife operating a weather\nradar on an island off the coast of Hong Kong and conned\nher into believing that Oklahoma was just like Hong Kong.\nAfter receiving tenure and the implied lifetime sentence\nat the university, I did the sensible thing: I quit and moved\nback to Boulder and founded my own non-profit research\ninstitution, the Center for Severe Weather Research (CSWR).\nMy wife and I run CSWR, manage the DOWs as National\nScience Foundation (NSF) Facilities, and conduct research\nprograms such as the VORTEX2 study and hurricane studies.\nWe have four young children who, so far, show no unhealthy\nobsessive interests in tornadoes, hurricanes or radars. I’ve just\nfinished the VORTEX2 tornado study (http://vortex2.org),\nwhich is the largest tornado research mission ever, funded\nmostly by NSF, employing about 120 scientists and crew in\n50 vehicles. We had 11 radars, 4 balloon trucks, UAVs, 40\ndeployable instruments, 13 mobile mesonets, photogrammetry\nand microphysics teams, damage survey teams, basically\nmore of anything that used to study tornadoes scientifically.\nJust imagine the lines for fuel and bathrooms in smalltown\ngas stations. During WWW, I’ll be keeping a nervous\neye out for any hurricanes threatening to make landfall.\nIf a hurricane looms, I’ll be leading my team into the eye.\nTELEPRESENCE CONVERSATIONS TENTATIVE\nMAO YUSHI\nChinese economist, 2012 Milton Friedman Liberty Award.\n(He wrote an online column criticizing the communist\nand totalitarian policies of Mao Zedong (Chairman\nMao) in China, attacked by Maoists in China.)\nhttp://www.cato.org/special/friedman/yushi/index.html\nYAO MING\nRetired Chinese basketball player who last played\nfor the Houston Rockets of NBA; investor.\nTAN DUN\nGrawemeyer, Oscar, and Grammy awarding winning\nChinese contemporary classical composer\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tan_Dun\nZHANG YONG HE\nChinese-American architect, former head of architecture\nat MIT.\nRICHARD SAUL WURMAN\nDescribed by Fortune magazine as an “intellectual hedonist”\nwith a “hummingbird mind,” Richard Saul Wurman\nseeks ways to make the complex clear. Recognizing at\nan early age that his ignorance is his greatest asset, he\nhas made it his mission to sort through the abundance\nof information that is available on every topic, and\ndesign the techniques to make it understandable.\nIn doing so he has continually sought to put himself\nin the presence of extraordinary people, including (all now\nall deceased), Francis Crick, Richard Feynman, Jonas Salk,\nEva Zeisel, Louis I. Kahn, Charles Eames, Frank Stanton and\nSchuyler van Renssalaer Cammann, and Arnold Toynbee.\nThere are many others. The only two bosses he had who\ndidn’t fire him were Lou Kahn and Charlie Eames.\nAs a result, Wurman has had many lives: as an author\n(83 books); FAIA Architect, 13-year partner in Murphy Levy\nWurman Architects; cartographer (mapped 1/3 of the Mayan\ncity of Tikal and current project 19.20.21.); teacher (Cambridge\nUniversity, England; Princeton; Washington University,\nSt. Louis; University of Southern California; University of\nCalifornia Los Angeles; City College of New York, and Dean,\nCal Poly School of Design); urban designer (recipient of MIT’s\nKevin Lynch award in urban design); graphic designer (AIGA\nGold Medal, membership in AGI and inducted into the Art\nDirectors Hall of Fame); information theorist (Information\nAnxiety, Follow the Yellow Brick Road) and in medicine (6\nbooks on healthcare and creator and chairman of TEDMED,\n1995–2010), and as a conference convener. The path of this\njourney has been paved by one surface: his curiosity.\nThe acknowledged father of Information\nArchitecture, Wurman has written, designed and published 83\nbooks on a range of topics, while creating conferences and new\nmapping projects. All contribute to a greater understanding of\ncomplex information. They spring from his particular brand\nof innovation: doing the opposite of what is rote or expected.\nWurman published his first two books in 1962. The\nfirst featured models of 50 world cities all constructed on a\nuniform scale, the other was the first book to be written on\nLouis Kahn. In 1967 he co-authored the first comparative\nstatistical atlas of major American cities. His latest book is\ncalled 33: Understanding Change & the Change in Understanding.\nIt chronicles the adventures and musings of the eccentric main\ncharacter, the Commissioner of Curiosity and Imagination.\nWurman created the ACCESS city guides, using\ngraphics and logical editorial organization to make places such\nas New York, Tokyo, Rome, Paris and London understandable\nto visitors. Other volumes he created focus on topics such as\nbaseball, football and the 1984 Olympics, the latter with over\nwith 3.2 million copies sold. His road atlases employed similar\ntechniques that elucidate U.S. geography and transportation\nnetworks. In addition he completed many one-off projects,\nsuch as his book Twin Peaks Access, which he co-authored\nwith David Lynch. Several of his books are in the permanent\ncollection of the Museum of Modern Art, New York.\nWurman began his career in conferences in 1972\nwhen he chaired the International Design Conference\nin Aspen. He then co-chaired the first Federal Design\nAssembly in 1973 and the national AIA Conference in 1976.\nWith each of these he changed the fundamentals of how\ngatherings were run. All these helped his creative molding\nof TED, TEDMED, and eg, the Entertainment Gathering.\nWurman created the TED conference in 1984,\nwhich he chaired through the 2002 meeting. TED brings\ntogether many of America’s clearest thinkers in the fields\nof technology, entertainment and design. He created the\neg conference in 2006 and the TEDMED conference in\n1995, which he chaired through 2010. Other conferences\nhe created and chaired include California 101, TEDSELL,\nTEDNYC, TED4Kobe in Japan and TEDCity in Toronto.\nNow in 77, Wurman continues to quell his restlessness\nwith a series of new projects. The WWW Conference will be an\nactive gathering of some of the brightest thinkers of our time\ndiscussing the complexity of emerging patterns on our planet\nin improvised conversation – intellectual jazz. In partnership\nwith Esri and @radical.media, 19.20.21. is a major cartographic\ninitiative that endeavors to standardize a methodology for\ncomparative urban data. His Urban Observatory project aims\nto establish, for the first time ever, a series of live and changing\nelectronically connected urban observatories around the world.\nWurman received both his B.Arch. and M.Arch.\ndegrees with highest honors from the University of\nPennsylvania in 1959. While there, he was awarded the\nArthur Spayd Brooks Gold Medal, the Thornton Oakley\nAward for Achievement in Creative Art, 2 Chandler grants\nand two graduate fellowships. He has also been awarded a\nGuggenheim Fellowship in Architecture and Design, three\nhonorary doctorates, two Graham Fellowships and numerous\ngrants from the National Endowment for the Arts. He is the\n2012 Lifetime Achievement Award recipient given by The\nSmithsonian Cooper-Hewitt National Design museum. He was\nrecently given the Gold Medal for Outstanding Contribution to\nPublic Discourse by Trinity College Dublin, an honor shared in\nthe past by Archbishop Desmond Tutu and Aung San Suu Kyi.\nWurman currently lives in Newport, RI\nwith his wife, novelist Gloria Nagy, and their three\nyellow Labradors, Abraham, Isaac and Jacob. They\nhave four children and six grandchildren.\nMEMO TO PARTICIPANTS\nre: CONVERSATIONS\nAs most of you are aware, I created TED in 1984 and\nchaired it through 2002. During that time I created\nTEDMED in 1995 and the eg Conference in 2006. For\nall those meetings I developed an 18-minute talk and\na series of rules called the TED Commandments.\nSeveral of you have asked ‘well what are the new\nguidelines as they relate to the WWW Conference’?\n1 Participants have all been sent the schedule\nlisting the person with whom they have\nbeen paired, attached again below.\n2 If you go to the participants page on the web\nsite, you can click on that person’s name and link\nto his or her biographical information.\n3 I have developed a list of 30 different premises or\npostulations that will begin you in improvised conversation.\n4 I have tried this and it works.\n5 You will be facing each other on comfortable\ncouches and not the audience.\n6 There will be approximately 150 people in the\naudience, which will be comprised of fellow participants,\nguests and individuals invited by sponsors.\n7 Absolutely no preparation is necessary.\n8 You will not be selling a book, charity, project or religion.\n9 As long as the conversation holds my attention and\nmy perceived attention of the audience, you will be in\nconversation. At the conclusion, I will with reasonable\npoliteness call up the next two individuals.\n10 If the conversation is fabulous but goes on so long\nas to potentially cause us to miss our lunch, I will also\nend it and the two of you can continue it over lunch.\n11 There will be no lectern but there will be a side\ntable for a cup of coffee or glass of water.\n12 There is no strict time schedule but I will\nattempt to keep the order of the final schedule.\n13 On occasion I might take the liberty part way into\na given conversation to add a third person, another\nparticipant or simply another member of the audience,\nwhom I know can add constructively to the conversation.\n14 The entire meeting will be filmed as inconspicuously\nas possible from the far left and right of the stage\nand with one small camera in the audience.\n15 At this moment there are no plans to live-stream\nany of the conference. There will be an app with access\nto a server to hold the conversations. It is planned that\nthis will be available on 1 December and will include a\nrunning line of translation into several languages.\n16 The app will also contain a large body of curated\npersonal information about you. Further explanation\nabout this will come to you next week.\n17 I have personally worked out the breaks, lunches and\ndinners and I believe they will be of the highest quality and in\nrooms that will delight you, both at Esri and at The Mission Inn.\n18 Obviously there is a lot of risk about the\nconversations, particularly the quality, spontaneity,\nclarity, improvisation and surprise.\n19 The goal is to find some threads that have not\nemerged before as you speak with your partner,\nwhich will encapsulate a type of honesty and a nonpredicted\npath in response to each other.\n20 This has happened in my several tests of this idea.\n21 To repeat, I am endeavoring to make the filming,\nambiance, location and lack of press all focus on\nyour comfort and the quality of your experience.\nThis above all is my concern and my goal.\n22 Improvised conversation in this manner is a new\nform but a wonderful conversation is perhaps the\noldest human media for creative discourse. So in\nthat sense, this is a great leap backwards.\n23 It will be a wonderful salon and an absolutely\nimmersive experience with extraordinary people.\nMEMO TO PARTICIPANTS\nre: FUTURE APP\nI trust each of you has read my 24-point memo called\nWWW Conference Conversation Guidelines with 24 points\nthat I believe give the spirit of the meeting itself. I’ve\nhad excellent response from many of you as well as\nfrom sponsors and attendees. This memo addresses the\noutcome of the conference, in other words, what I do with\nthe filming of these approximately 30 conversations.\n1 It will be filmed in black and white by a team directed\nby Jon Kamen and Sidney Beaumont of @radical.media,\nand John Halloran of John Halloran Associates.\n2 It will be unedited. There will be a camera on\neach of the individuals in conversation, as well as a\nlong camera on the three of us sitting on stage.\n3 Michael Smolens and David Orban of dotSUB will\nthen translate it into perhaps 10 languages and add a\nrunning translation in English, which will address the\nlanguage needs of 90% plus of the world’s population.\n4 This will live on a server and be accessed by\nan app that has a release date at this juncture of 1\nDecember. The app will also contain a great deal of\nadditional information on each of the presenters.\n5 The additional curated stuff—photos, videos,\nand links is what this memo is focused on.\n6 Scrollmotion has already done two extraordinary\nversions of the organization and design of this app. They\nhave offices in San Diego and New York City.\n7 There will be a series of unique videos on which I will\ncomment later, made where appropriate of you in situ.\n8 The video of the entire conference of course can\nbe accessed by pairings of speakers from a list and\nviewed as you would at the conference showing\nindividuals in improvised conversation. However, one\ncould also double click on a single name and go into\nthis visual biography of each of the participants.\n9 The demo can be found at\nhttp://vimeo.com/user7992663/review/47187545/29ddc526f0\nThe password is WWW. It shows an extremely brief version of\nC. K. Williams, the Pulitzer Prize winning poet, in which you\ncannot only see a bio, for which we will ask a major expansion,\nbut also photographs of the covers of a few of his 11 books. We\nwould also like to have all of his books, which you will be able\nto order form the app, some outtake videos, not from the\nconference but from other sources that we would identify, and\nthat you will identify, as well as, in the case of C. K. Williams,\nmany pages, a few shown here, of his personally edited\nwritings of his poetry—something you can’t find on YouTube,\na presentation or in a book, or perhaps anywhere but this app.\n10 The idea of this app is to get a behind the scenes,\nbehind the curtain, personalized journey through\neach individual, which will also have a list of links\nto suggested articles, reviews, YouTubes and other\nmaterial that will fill out this visual biography.\n11 This is an important point: if you Google Richard\nWurman, you come up with perhaps 450,000 citations.\nThe number changes daily. This would amount to 40,000+\npages, which of course nobody looks at. Basically it’s junk\nbig data, and people mostly focus on one article and a\nwikipedia entry. The attempt here is to have the first primitive\ndevelopment of a platform for beginning to assuage some\ncuriosity in the beginning of looking at a visual biography of\nat least these 50 people. If the platform works it’s scalable.\nThat’s the idea of a new modality. If it works for people\nperhaps it will work for healthcare and other subjects.\n12 I’m putting together a team of people consisting of Ali\nSmolens, who will help curate some of the materials for\nmany of you, Paul Kandarian, a magazine writer friend\nof mine from Rhode Island, and three others plus Blaise\nZerega, CEO of FORA.tv who has agreed to make some\noriginal, simple videos such as Frank Gehry walking around\nhis office showing and discussing models of buildings that\nhe has not built, or variations of for instance the 8 Spruce\nStreet tower in New York or hopefully Craig Venter’s\nlaboratories in a walk-through, E.O. Wilson’s offices, etc. etc.\n13 So this is a request for the following: please start thinking\nabout the stuff that you’ve never shown: everything from\nbaby pictures, pictures of your pets, pictures of your office,\npictures of your home, things that make you real. Multiple\nphotographs of yourself, perhaps a strip of photographs of\nyou taken in a photo booth at an amusement park that you\nhave in a drawer. Writings that you’ve done that show your\nedits, something that shows you’re real, human, and shows\nyour process. Pictures of your laboratories. Agree to have\nsomebody do a 5- or 10-minute walk through with you in your\noffice or your lab or your place of work or your architectural\nstudio. Videos or DVDs that for example I know Moshe\nSafdie has which he makes to describe what a building will\nlook like in computer graphics to a client. I know he has a\nfantastic one of an apartment house in Singapore. And I’m\nsure Bjarke has similar things that he generally does not\nrelease. Covers of books about you, covers of books by you. A\nlist of articles that you think critically describes you and links\nto YouTubes or other videos or other citations that you think\nand you have curated yourself that make you particularly\ninteresting, not the half a million available on line. Julie\nTaymor most have lots of stuff as well as David Blaine.\n14 We hope to have this put together, along with the\nentire conference, for release by 1 December and promote\nit immediately after Thanksgiving with the help of\nIDG, Flipboard (Mike McCue), Esri, IIR and others. I\nam going to ask for your cooperation out in Redlands at\nthe conference and I will have additional copies of this\nand the other memo to give you when you register.\n15 Attached are technical specifications for those of\nyou who understand them yourself. Otherwise please\nshow them to somebody in your office under the age of\n30 who automatically understands them, who could help\nus translate whatever you send us in a usable format. I\ndon’t understand them myself but I’m sure some of you\nhave a better handle on this than I do. These will make\nthe process smooth and efficient and within budget.\nTHANKS & TEAM\nHOST\nESRI\nSPONSORS\nGE\nWILLIAM R.
