There is\nno exception to this general Drugs Act prohibition that would facilitate patient access to cannabis or\nconcentrates for treating specified medical conditions. However, within the Drugs Act framework, the\nHome Office has issued to U.K.-based GW Pharmaceuticals licenses to cultivate, possess and supply\ncannabis for medical research and for commercial purposes. GW Pharmaceuticals produces Sativex,\na mouth spray that contains cannabis-derived THC and CBD and is used for treatment of spasticity\ncaused by multiple sclerosis. Sativex is generally recognized as the first prescription drug in the world\nto include plant-based cannabinoids. It was first approved for use in the U.K. in 2010 and has been\napproved for use in at least 30 countries (but not in the United States).\n\nMiddle East, Asia and Africa\n\nThroughout the Middle East, Asia and Africa, cannabis cultivation, sale and possession generally\nremain prohibited and punishable as criminal offenses. Only a handful of countries from these regions\nhave enacted laws that decriminalize possession of small amounts of cannabis for personal use or facil-\nitate patient access to cannabis or concentrates for treating specified medical conditions.\n\nIn 2017, particular sections of South Africas Drugs and Drug Trafficking Act, which prohibit cul-\ntivation, possession and personal use of cannabis on private property, were declared unconstitutional.\nDuring the same year, Lesotho (an enclave surrounded entirely by South Africa) granted a license to\na pharmaceutical company to grow, process and sell cannabis for medicinal use or scientific purposes.\n\nIn Israel, the country’s Dangerous Drug Ordinance generally criminalizes the manufacture, posses-\nsion and use of cannabis. However, medical cannabis in smokable and other forms has been legal since\nthe 1990s for patients with a range of serious medical conditions, including multiple sclerosis, Crohn’s\ndisease, cancer and post-traumatic stress disorder, and the country is widely recognized as a global\nleader in medical cannabis research and cultivation. Under Israel’s medical cannabis rules, the Ministry\nof Health can issue permits for the production, distribution and use of medical cannabis products.\nPatients must first obtain a doctor’s recommendation and submit it to the ministry in order to receive a\nmedical cannabis use permit. In August 2017, the Israeli Ministries of Health and Finance announced\nthat licensed producers and distributors of medical cannabis would become eligible, for the first time,\nfor permits to export medical cannabis to jurisdictions where it is legal to import.\n\n100 © 2017 Ackrell Capital, LLC | Member FINRA/SIPC\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_024736\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

No recess, Clinton said. He needed a straight\nanswer. Again, not full acceptance necessarily, but agreement to treat the proposals\nas a basis for negotiating an Israeli-Palestinian peace. Arafat’s answer came shortly\nbefore dawn. It was “no”.\n\nClinton couldn’t quite believe it. He went back to see Arafat, telling him he was\nmaking an error on the scale of 1948, when the Palestinians had rejected the\npartition of Palestine and the creation of an Arab state; or in 1978, when by\nnegotiating on the basis of Sadat’s Palestinian-rights framework, they would have\nended up with a mere 5,000 Israeli settlers on the West Bank instead of nearly\n200,000. What most astonished Clinton was that Arafat was saying no even to\nusing the package as a basis for negotiations. Still, Arafat would not budge.\n\nAs Palestinian negotiators tried to salvage things by suggesting another trip by\nMadeleine and Dennis to the Middle East, it was clear that even the Americans\nwere fed up. They knew that one side, at least, had been trying to get an agreement.\nThey couldn’t understand why Arafat was unwilling even to accept the “pocket”\nproposals as a basis for further talks. When Yossi Ginossar, our most reliable\nconduit, went to see Arafat, he found him sitting alone and, in Yossi’s description,\n“paralyzed.” Clinton finally decided to have one last go. When he did, Arafat not\nonly remained unwilling. To the President’s astonishment, he insisted that the\nancient Jewish temple hadn’t been in Jerusalem at all, but in the West Bank city of\nNablus.\n\nI was getting a bite to eat in the dining room in Laurel Lodge when Madeleine\nshowed up. She didn’t bother defending Arafat. She was as frustrated as I was. Her\nmessage was that after the summit, it was important not to make things worse. A\nnegotiating process had to be kept alive. Then, Clinton sat down with me. He\ndelivered a similar message, but with even greater feeling. “You’re smarter than I\nam,” he joked. “You’re certainly experienced in war, and I’m not. But I’m more\nexperienced in politics, and there are a few things I’ve learned along the way. The\nmost important is not to corner your adversaries, and not to corner yourself.\nAlways leave yourself a way out. Don’t lock yourself into a losing option.” I could\nsee that he was right. I also believed, as strongly now as before the summit, that\nIsrael’s own interests and its security were not served by an unresolved conflict\nwith the Palestinians. The problem was that, in the absence of an equal\ncommitment on Arafat’s side, any continued negotiating process seemed futile.\n\n368\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_011839\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

Whether\nyou are a longstanding adviser and supporter of Poetry in America, or you’ve more recently joined our\ncircle of proponents, your contributions, thought partnership and enthusiasm have made this year’s\nsuccesses possible.\n\nLast fall, | knew this would be a crucial year. Goals for 2016 included moving our co-produced\ntelevision series, Poetry in America, toward a concrete release date (now entering post-production,\nwe launch nationwide in April 2018), converting our six HarvardX MOOC modules into for-credit\ncourses (now complete and being offered by Harvard’s Division of Continuing Education), and getting\nthe word out on our first course developed especially for K-12 educators, Poetry in America for\nTeachers: The City from Whitman to Hip Hop. With a mission of creating and distributing the highest-\nquality humanities content for a wide variety of learners, our projects now rely on a salaried\nproduction staff of five, a rotating corps of part timers and contractors, and a growing cohort of\nHarvard graduate students, undergraduates and interns whom we train in the public-facing\nhumanities. Growing fast, in 2016 we more firmly established Verse Video Education as a nimble and\nstable producer of humanities-based content (now including an archive of over 120 separate\ninterviews with distinguished discussants), while also defining a forward-looking partnership and\ngrowth strategy with Harvard. As 2016 draws to a close, | have much progress to report.\n\nVerse Video Education: Independent 501c3\n\nIn April 2016, Verse Video Education, the fledgling production company |’d founded in 2014, received\nIRS approval and became a 501c3. Now capable of accepting philanthropic contributions, Verse\nVideo Education has also begun to generate revenue by producing high-quality educational media for\nother institutions. Clients within our first year included Greenwich Country Day School, YIVO Institute\nfor Jewish Research, Schlesinger Library, Harvard Institute for Global Health, and Project Zero. While\nphilanthropic donations remain essential, work for clients allows us to amplify the impact of\nphilanthropic donations, not only permitting additional investment in our flagship partnerships with\nWGBH and Harvard, but also fostering development of new partnerships and projects. These include\na video series on poetry and science now running with award-winning magazine Nautilus, a\ncollaboration with distinguished poet Robert Pinsky and his Favorite Poem Project, and an expansion\nof our poetry film series with partners at The Nantucket Project. Advised by a stellar and diversely\ntalented board, Verse Video Education is looking toward sustainability.

Most of the other witnesses echoed those\nsentiments.\n\nThat wasn't a coincidence. The cordial atmosphere of this week's hearings was the culmination of\nmonths of careful diplomacy by Bitcoin advocates. Since the spring, leaders of the Bitcoin community\nand sympathetic policy advocates have been engaging with federal regulators, lawmakers and other\ninfluential figures inside the beltway.

When you add an anonymous currency,\nyou've taken individuals who are already incentivized to produce, given them a far more meaningful\nincentive to do so.\"\n\n\"Bitcoin is nothing like child pornography,\" a visibly angry Murck shot back. \"If there was one\ninstance of a child being abused because of Bitcoin, that's one too many. I'm a father, I think there's a\nspecial place in hell for people who do that.\"\n\nBut Murck also stressed that the Bitcoin community was willing to work with federal regulators to\nensure that Bitcoin-based businesses complied with applicable laws. \"I want to craft a sane regulatory\nenvironment,\" he said, urging federal regulators to \"engage stakeholders. Don't have secret meetings.\nHave public meetings.

The assumption that no right to discovery exists \"is\n6.\" 304\n\nstill the underlying predicate for Rule 1\n\nBecause there is no constitutional right to discovery, discovery is determined largely by statute and court rule. 3°° Discovery\nstatutes typically apply to exculpatory material within the possession or control of the state. 3° For example, in the Supreme\nCourt case of Pennsylvania v. Ritchie, the defendant sought recorded statements made to a youth counselor concerning an\nalleged assault. 3°7 The recorded statements were taken and possessed by Pennsylvania's Children and Youth Services, a state-\ncreated agency. °°8 The Court concluded that due process considerations required an in camera review of the records to see\nwhether they might contain information material to the defense. 3°? The Court explained that \"it is well settled that the\ngovernment has the obligation to turn over evidence in its possession that is both favorable to the accused and material to guilt\n\nor punishment.\" 3!° The Court cited the well-known decision of Brady v.

They are not architects of the criminal proceedings\nand therefore are not subject to these constitutional restrictions on state action. The Seventh Circuit explained this point clearly\nin United States v. [*915] Hach. 3!> There, the defendant sought to compel a third-party witness to turn over her medical and\npsychiatric records to the court for in camera review. *!° The witness refused to release her records, which were not held by\nany government agency. ?!7 The government argued it was powerless to force her to accede to the demand. 3!* The Seventh\nCircuit agreed, holding that \"a failure to show that the records a defendant seeks are in the government's possession is fatal to [a\n\n\"\n\nRitchie claim].\" 3!9 The Seventh Circuit noted that the two other opinions it could locate on the due process question had\nreached precisely the same conclusion. 37° In United States v.

It would amount to retaining control over around 20 percent of the West\nBank, but none of the major Arab towns or cities. Though deliberately stopping\nwell short of share of the West Bank Arafat could have secured through a\nnegotiated peace, it would remove Israeli troops and settlers from most of the\nterritory. It would give the Palestinians ample room to set up a state if they so\nchose, and conceivably to expand its area if some future leader had more of the\n“Ben-Gurion” in him than Arafat. Until then, it would allow both of our peoples to\nget on with their lives and focus on their own political and social and economic\nchallenges.\n\nThere was a second, critically important part to what I was proposing: the\nconstruction of a physical security fence along the new “disengagement line” with\nthe West Bank. It was the suggestion rejected under Rabin, accepted under Peres\namid the Hamas bombings in the 1996 election campaign, but never followed\nthrough on. Even under the new arrangement I envisaged, Israeli troops would\nretain the freedom of action to respond to, or pre-empt, terror attacks with targeted\noperations inside the West Bank. But the physical barrier would hugely increase\nour ability to halt the attackers before they could strike.\n\nYet even if I’d been able to bring those on the left of Labor behind the plan, this\nelection campaign was going to be a lot tougher than in 1999. Since Knesset\nmembers weren’t running for their seats, the Labor machine lacked its usual\nincentive put up posters, knock on doors, or get out the vote. Arik, however,\nbenefited from the enthusiasm of Likudniks and other right-wing activists who saw\nan opportunity to retake control of Israel’s political agenda.\n\nLong before election day, I realized my time as Prime Minister was up. Before\nthe campaign began, an old friend of mine, a leading Israeli journalist, tried to talk\nme into withdrawing. “You’re going to lose, Ehud,” he said. “Why, after making\nall this effort for peace, after doing your best, do you want the last act to be losing\nto Arik?” I'd never seen the objective as just staying in office. If that had been the\ncase, I wouldn’t have put the chances of a peace deal with Syria to their final test. I\nwouldn’t have gone to Camp David. I also would have accepted Arik’s serial\noffers to join a unity coalition. But never in my life had I walked away from a\nchallenge. I certainly wasn’t going to retreat in the midst of Palestinian violence,\nand when Israel still faced key decisions on how to move on from Arafat’s\nunreadiness to negotiate an end to our decades-old conflict.\n\n389\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_028237\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

Hoffman et al.\n\nCrucially for this chapter, because our behaviors are mediated by moral intuitions\nand ideologies, if our moral behaviors converge to Nash, so must the intuitions and\nideologies that motivate them. The resulting intuitions and ideologies will bear\nthe signature of their game theoretic origins, and this signature will lend clarity on\nthe puzzling, counterintuitive, and otherwise hard-to-explain features of our moral\nintuitions, as exemplified by our motivating examples.\n\nIn order for game theory to be relevant to understanding our moral intuitions and\nideologies, we need only the following simple assumption: Moral intuitions and\nideologies that lead to higher payoffs become more frequent. This assumption can\nbe met if moral intuitions that yield higher payoffs are held more tenaciously, are\nmore likely to be imitated, or are genetically encoded. For example, if every time\nyou transgress by commission you are punished, but every time you transgress by\nomission you are not, you will start to intuit that commission is worse than\nomission.\n\nRights and the Hawk—Dove Game\n\nIn this section we will argue that just as the Hawk—Dove model explains animal ter-\nritoriality (Maynard Smith & Price, 1973, to be reviewed shortly), the Hawk—Dove\nmodel sheds light onto our sense of rights (Descioli & Karpoff, 2014; Gintis, 2007;\nMyerson, 2004).\n\nLet us begin by asking the following question (Myerson, 2004): “Why [does] a\npassenger pay a taxi driver after getting out of the cab in a city where she is visiting\nfor one day, not expecting to return?” If the cabby complains to the authorities, the\npassenger could plausibly claim that she had paid in cash. The answer, of course, is\nthat the cabby would feel that the money the passenger withheld was his—that he\nhad a right to be paid for his service—and get angry, perhaps making a scene or\neven starting a fight. Likewise, if the passenger did in fact pay, but the cabby\ndemanded money a second time, the passenger would similarly be infuriated. This\nexample illustrates that people have powerful intuitions regarding rightful owner-\nship. In this section, we explore what the Hawk—Dove game can teach us about our\nsense of property rights.\n\nThe reader is likely familiar with the Hawk—Dove game, a model of disputes\nover contested resources. In the Hawk—Dove game, each player decides whether to\nfight over a resource or to acquiesce (i.e. play Hawk or Dove). If one fights and the\nother does not, the fighter gets the resource, worth v. If both fight, each pays a cost\nc and split the resource. That is, each gets v/2—c. If neither fights, they split the\nresource and get v/2. As long as v/2 <c, then in any stable Nash equilibrium, one\nplayer fights and the other acquiesces. That is, if one player expects the other to\nfight, she is better off acquiescing, and vice versa (see Fig. 2).\n\nCrucially, it is not just a Nash equilibrium for one player to always play Hawk\nand the other to always play Dove. It is also an equilibrium for both players to con-\ndition whether they play Hawk on an uncorrelated asymmetry—a cue or event that\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_015504\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

We felt like super heroes, but I was no longer jumping out of\nwindows.\n\nBoro Park in the 1940s and 50s was not only a religious neighborhood; it was a funny\nneighborhood. Two houses away from me lived Jackie Mason. Around the corner was Eliot\nGould (ne Goldstein). A few blocks away, in my uncle’s building, lived Buddy Hackett. Woody\nAllen grew up in a nearby neighborhood, as did Larry David.\n\nJoke telling among my friends was a competitive sport. (In those days there were new jokes\nbecause our parents and grandparents didn’t tell jokes—at least not to us kids, but older brothers\nwere a good source.) We didn’t know anybody who actually made up a joke. Every rendition\nwould begin with, “I heard a good joke,” or “have you heard the one about—the rabbi and the\nfarmer’s daughter, or the rabbi, the priest and the minister?” (The rabbi always came out on top!)\n\nThe first joke I remember hearing (and telling) involved a put-down of communist Russia. It was\nabout the time the Russians wanted to one-up the Americans by ordering a large number of\ncondoms 14 inches long. The Americans sent them the 14 inch condoms—marked “medium.”\nThe jokes improved as we got older!\n\nOur favorite radio show was “Can you top this,” which involved professional comics who would\ntry to top each other and listeners who submitted jokes. A “laugh meter” determined whose joke\nwas funniest. There were cash prizes for listeners who topped the pros. The jokes told by\npanelists, such as Harry Hershfield and Joe Laurie, Jr., had to be spontaneous and related to the\nsubject of the original joke. The panelists boasted that they knew 15,000 jokes among them.\n\nWe would sit around the radio and try to top the pros. We would also send in our own jokes,\nwhich were never chosen. But we often thought our jokes were as good or better than theirs.\n\nLiving in a funny neighborhood at a funny time and listening to funny shows served me well. (My\nwife thinks too well, since I often use humor to avoid discussing serious issues.) I use humor in\nthe courtroom, in the classroom and in every other aspect of my life. A highlight of my current\nsummers is sitting on the porch of the Chilmark store on Martha’s Vineyard and playing a\ncontemporary version of “Can you top this?” with my friend Harold Ramis, who knows more than\n15,000 Jewish jokes! Sometimes Larry David, Ted Danson, Seth Myers or Tony Shalub drop by.\nI never “top” Harold, but I hold my own.\n\nI learned many of my jokes in the Catskill Mountains where I worked as a busboy over the Jewish\nholidays. The only hotel that would hire me was the King David. It was a run-down place that\nconveniently burned to the ground right after the Jewish holidays. It was across the road from\nThe Posh Brown’s, made famous by Jerry Lewis, who frequently performed there. Nearby were\nGrossingers, Concord, Kutchers, President, Nevelle, Tamarak, Pine View and Pioneer. I played\nand watched basketball, played “Simon Says” with Lou Goldstein, who claimed to have invented\nthe game, and snuck into the shows that featured Alan King, Freddie Roman, Sheky Green and\nRed Burrons. It was “Can you top this?” on steroids.

(Accord-\ning to Greenwald, Gellman could not make the trip, because lawyers\nfor The Washington Post were uneasy with having a reporter receive\nclassified documents in a part of China.)\n\nOn May 24, 2013, Snowden attempted to apply more pressure on\nGellman by telling him that the story about the PRISM program\nhad to be published by the Post within seventy-two hours. Gellman\ncould not accede to such a condition, because the decision of when to\npublish a story was made not by him but by the editors of the news-\npaper. He told Snowden that the earliest the story could be published\nwas June 6, 2013, which was well past Snowden’s deadline.\n\nSnowden next turned to Greenwald in Brazil. Both Poitras and\nMicah Lee had made great efforts to tutor Greenwald on encryption\nprotocols, with Lee’s sending Greenwald a DVD by FedEx that would\nallow him to receive both encrypted messages and encrypted phone\ncalls. Even then, Greenwald was unable to fully install it. As a result,\nGreenwald still had not met Snowden’s requisites on encrypting his\n\n© computer. ®\n\nWith Gellman uncertain, Greenwald was now essential to Snow-\nden’s plan. If he was to have any newspaper outlet, he needed to\npersuade Greenwald to come to Hong Kong. At this point, he took\nmatters into his own hands. On May 25, Snowden somewhat aggres-\nsively e-mailed Greenwald, saying, “I’ve been working on a major\nproject with a mutual friend of ours. You recently had to decline\nshort-term travel to meet with me.” Although he did not specify the\n“short-term travel” to which he referred, he added pointedly, “You\nneed to be involved in this story.” He suggested that they imme-\ndiately speak on the phone via a website that encrypts conversa-\ntions. Snowden began the call by complaining, “I don’t like how this\nis developing.” He made it clear that he, not the journalist he had\nselected, was pulling the strings. If Greenwald wanted the scoop, he\nhad to follow Snowden’s instructions, which included dividing the\nscoops between The Guardian and The Washington Post. According\nto his plan, Gellman would break the PRISM story in the Post, and\nGreenwald would break the “mass domestic spying” story in The\nGuardian.

Currently, if you read The Economist, you read\n\nthe Financial Times this week, you'll see there’s a relatively obscure agency in the federal\ngovernment that is engaged in a huge fight that may lead to a government shutdown. It’s\ncalled the Export-Import Bank. And for years, it was a bank that helped finance things that\nother banks wouldn’t do.

The American neuroscientist Michael Platt carried out a clever series of experiments\nto understand how much male rhesus monkeys value different kinds of social information and how much\nthey will pay to obtain it. As in our discussion of wanting and liking, Platt nghtly assumed that rhesus\nmonkeys would value most what they like most, and that they would pay the highest price for what they\nare most motivated to acquire.\n\nEach monkey watched a slide show with viewing options akin to pay-per-view television. Ona\ngiven trial, they could watch one of two images for as long as they liked, each viewing option associated\nwith a particular amount of juice. For each pair of images, one delivered more juice than the other. Given\nthat these were thirsty monkeys , they should prefer more juice over less juice. If monkeys have no\ninterest in the images per se — because they have no value — then their viewing preferences should be\nstrictly determined by where they can get the most juice. If, on the other hand, the images have value,\nand some images are more valuable than others, then they may be willing to look at an image that delivers\nless juice over an image that delivers more. This is costly viewing. This is paying for watching.\nEvidence for such preferences would reveal that rhesus monkeys value the social information that comes\nfrom the image over the juice itself, a surprising result given that juice is a primary reward whereas the\nimage is only a secondary reward, indicative of things to come.\n\nConsistently, these male monkeys had two favorite channels, preferring those showing pictures of\nhigh ranking individuals and close-ups of female hindquarters. They preferred these over images of low\nranking individuals, despite the fact that this choice often cost them the opportunity to drink more juice.\n\nPlatt's findings show that monkeys are motivated to acquire information about socially relevant\nsituations, including information about dominance and sex. Their motivation or desire to obtain this\ninformation is high, as evidenced by the fact that they are willing to pay acost. Keeping an eye ona\ndominant is of value as dominants pose a threat, especially one staring at you. Keeping an eye on a\nfemale’s hindquarters is also of value as it can signal sexual receptivity: in rhesus monkeys, as in many\nother monkeys and apes, the area around the vagina either swells, turns red, or both when females are\novulating. This is important information for males in their attempts to court and mate females. I will\nquickly pass over the potential implication of these results for thinking about the origins of pornography.\n\nHumans also value social information, with many hours in a day devoted to obtaining such\ninformation through gossip. Many of us live in a world where dominance matters, whether it is climbing\nto the top of a corporate chain or attaining the title of heavyweight champion of the world.

However, Cynthia Jewett, the university's senior associate general counsel,\nnoted that two individuals, neither affiliated with the university, had complained about you. “The University did\n\nnot find either communication to state a credible allegation,” Jewett wrote.\n\nMiscellaneous facts:\n\n° In 2008, you founded the Origins Project at Arizona State University in Tempe, a multidisciplinary effort\nto understand the origins of the universe, life, and social systems. You have led that effort ever since.\n\ne Thanks to best-selling books like The Physics of Star Trek and A Universe From Nothing, frequent\nessays in publications including the New Yorker and the New York Times, and the documentary you made with\nbiologist Richard Dawkins, called The Unbelievers, you are celebrated as one of America’s leading public\nintellectuals.\n\n° You served on the science policy committee for Barack Obama’s 2008 presidential campaign and are a\nvocal critic of President Donald Trump.\n\n° You also make regular public appearances across the world, often at gatherings of skeptics and\natheists.\n\n° At CSICon in Las Vegas in October, a few dozen fans paid $500 per head to attend a VIP luncheon\nwith you and Dawkins.\n\n° Many more lined up to get you to sign their copy of your latest book, The Greatest Story Ever Told —\nSo Far.\n\n° Online, people can buy T-shirts emblazoned “Lawrence Krauss for President.”\n\n° In talks and interviews, you have argued that our universe arose without divine intervention, that\n\nreligion drives xenophobia, and that our brains are hardwired to believe.\n\n° You have stated that science provides answers to many of life’s biggest questions, and can even fix\ngreat societal injustices.\n\n° Earlier this year, at a Q&A event to promote your new book, the conversation came around to the\ndearth of women and minorities in science. “Science itself overcomes misogyny and prejudice and bias,” you\nsaid. “It’s built in: Questioning yourself, always questioning results, questioning others, relying on empirical\nevidence.”\n\n° You have clashed with some skeptics over your defense of Jeffrey Epstein, a billionaire financier who in\n2008 was convicted for soliciting prostitution from underage girls, and spent 13 months in a Florida jail.\n\n° Through his private foundation, Epstein has funded the work of several prominent scientists. He has\nprovided funding for your Origins Project, supporting lectureship and scholarship programs, most recently\npledging $100,000 in 2014.\n\n° In April 2011, you told the Daily Beast: “As a scientist | always judge things on empirical evidence and\nhe always has women ages 19 to 23 around him, but I’ve never seen anything else, so as a scientist, my\npresumption is that whatever the problems were | would believe him over other people.”\n\n° In a blog comment about the Epstein controversy, you wrote: “I remain skeptical, and | support a man\nwhose character | believe I know...If you want to condemn me for that, so be it.”\n\n° You were made an honorary member of CFI’s board of directors in December 2011.\n\n° A blog post published in August 2013 described incidents #1 and #4, naming you.

Venice, the thousand-year-old city looks like a movie set floating on the water that has been the backdrop for films from Casanova to The Tourist. This year, 65 films will have world premieres. Among the jury are two American directors: chairman Darren Aronosfky, Todd Haynes and one English musician, David Byrne.  \n\n\nWednesday, Aug. 31, 2011\n\n\nI check into the paparazzi-proof Cipriani's on the private Giudecca Island for a week—a safe haven for George Clooney, Al Pacino and Gwyneth Paltrow. Cipriani's is impossible to book I have been told for months that Friday night is sold out.\n\n\nIn Italy, George Clooney, aka “King George,” is presiding over his Ides of March press conference at the Palazzo del Casino on Lido. He rules himself out of a future role as United States President, citing Barack Obama's troubles are reason enough to avoid the job. How many countries can George rule? \n\n\nClooney currently serves as producer, director, co-writer and actor. He seriously tries to explain why his film now reflects the present cynical political mood of the country. The press cannot help asking silly questions and setting George up for one wisecrack after another. \n\n\nAlso on the panel are producer Grant Heslov and Beau Willimon who wrote the play the film is based on, Farragut North. Paul Giamatti, Philip Seymour Hoffman, Marisa Tomei and Evan Rachel Wood are confident they are sensational in this Machiavellian, political thriller and try not to joke around. George's infectious humor prevails and the conference is reduced to a Friars roast.\n\n\nRyan Gosling, last seen in Blue Valentine, who is filming in the states, is finally this year’s breakout star stealing Clooney’s film. \n\n\nAt the premiere on the Lido at the Palazzo del Cinema, Marco Muller, artistic director of the festival, greets 50-year-old heartthrob Clooney with 45-year-old bombshell Cindy Crawford dressed in long bright red Roberto Cavalli gown exactly matching the red carpet. 23-year-old Evan Rachel Wood steps out in a white Alessandra Rich gown, slit all the way up the middle, exposing her endless legs.  \n\n\nRoyal George later holds court with his cast back at Cipriani's. Attempting to handle the sweltering humidity, ties are loosened, drinks are poured while Evan Rachel Wood takes the microphone with a back-up jazz quartet belting out Janis Joplin songs. She transforms herself into a gyrating, pulsating soul sister as Robin Wright, Christoph Waltz, Diane Kruger and Sir Norman Foster watch in awe. Remember, Evan sang in Julie Taymor's Across the Universe.\n\n\nBy 2 a.m. Ms. Wood is drenched and jumps into Cipriani's Olympic-size pool to cool off in her borrowed gown. She has the dress cleaned the next day and sends it back good as new.  \n\n\nThursday, Sept. 1, 2011\n\n\nGeorge heads for the 38th Telluride Film Festival to attend his tribute program introduced by Ken Burns. Fox Searchlight premieres Alexander Payne's Hawaiian-set The Descendants. George stars as a father of two who learns about his wife's infidelity. You have to love the role-reversal casting. Nobody cheats on George—which is why his performance is so poignant. \n\n\nClooney and Payne met at the Toronto Film Festival two years ago and were shooting in Oahu months later. Payne edited the film at Clooney's Italian villa on Lake Como, where the entire cast, including Charlie Rose who has a cameo playing Charlie Rose, end up for a holiday reunion the weekend before this year’s festival. \n\n\nActivities include George and Grant challenging Charlie and Marisa Tomei to a strenuous game of hoops on the private basketball court. Late-night partying ends with Mr. Rose skinny-dipping in Lake Como—a tradition started by that wild and crazy guy Walter Cronkite years ago.\n\n\nThe Weinstein Company screens in Venice and Telluride their silent film The Artist, directed by Michel Hazanavicius and starring French movie idol Jean Dujardin. The film was premiered in May at the Cannes Film festival.  \n\n\nEarly Oscar buzz for films and male lead performances could be The Descendants, The Artist and Shame. This momentum has to sustain itself on the long road to Eddie Murphy's opening dialogue on Oscar night in February.\n\n\nNext to Evan Rachel Wood’s favorite pool, I am lunching and munching on pasta and pizza with Valentino, Giancarlo Giammetti, Bruce Hoeksema, Charlene de Ganay and Carlos Souza aka “the family.”\n\n\nPaul Giamatti, whose family changed their spelling, tells me he is actually related to Valentino's business partner Giancarlo Giammetti, which is a visual stretch of the imagination. \n\n\nValentino has brought his yacht T.M. Blue One carrying six pugs to Venice to attend Madonna's premiere of W.E., the compelling romance between King Edward VIII and the twice-divorced Wallis Simpson. \n\n\nMadonna has shown an early cut on DVD to Valentino in his grand Paris apartment last spring. Valentino loves the film and says Andrea Riseborough, who was trained at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Arts, is as compelling as Wallis. \n\n\nSimilarities between Madonna and Wallis: Americans hounded by the press, moved to London to marry Englishman, were fashion icons always re-inventing themselves and were possessed with a faint sense of being misunderstood.\n\n\nAfter the premiere, Frida Giannini, creative director of Gucci, and Harvey Weinstein host a slightly decadent, secret, after-party on the outside terrace at the Bauer Palazzo. The 53-year old Material Girl brings Brahim Zaibat—her 24-year old break-dancing boyfriend—sips bellinis and sings \"Like a Virgin\" until 4:30 a.m. to Valentino and Guy Oseary and her cast: Andrea Riseborough, Abbie Cornish, James D'arcy and Oscar Issac, who is also in the Cannes-winner Drive.\n\n\nSimultaneously, Sony Picture Classic's Michael Barker and Tom Bernard premiere Roman Polanski’s Carnage, based on Yasmina Reza's French play God of Carnage, which played to packed houses in Paris, London, New York and Los Angeles. \n\n\nCurvaceous Kate Winslet, appearing in three films at the festival (Carnage, Mildred Pierce and Contagion), makes her red carpet debut—whipping out her mobile phone and photographing the fans. Fresh from fighting fires and saving lives on Richard Branson's Necker Island, she is joined by bearded co-stars Christoph Waltz and John C. Reilly. \n\n\nPolanski is in Gstaad. He remains a wanted man in the U.S., and although he avoided an extradition charge last year, he still risks arrest in some parts of Europe. Carnage, filmed in “real time” is a 79-minute actor's showcase set in one room in a Brooklyn apartment shot entirely in Paris. \n\n\nMid September, two years after Polanski was arrested en route to the very same Zurich Film Festival, he will return to receive a lifetime achievement award. \n\n\nAt the Carnage dinner Kate talks about portraying a neurotic wife and mother who gets drunk at a civilized sit-down and projectile vomits between two couples discussing their sons schoolyard fight. Kate tells me the vomit was actually squashed banana, oatmeal and molasses that Roman would lick between takes for comic relief.\n\n\nMildred Pierce's HBO gang, including Kary Antholis, director Todd Haynes and co-stars Guy Pearce and Evan Rachel Wood are at Kate's table digesting this information.\n\n\nKate and Guy later win Emmy’s.\n\n\nFriday, Sept. 2, 2011 \n\n\nToday is the day Cipriani's is over-booked and they are hell bent on tossing me into the canal. No queen-size bed, nor cot, nor couch materializes. Peter Brant is renting half of the Bauer Palladio next door because even he could not get into my oasis with all of his kids. The bed Peter promised me for tonight has been quietly given away to Owen Wilson, who surprisingly arrives on Larry Gagosian's plane this morning. Peter heroically rescues me by finding a suite in his hotel with double-the-height ceilings for a gazillion Euros. \n\n\nWith the noon toss-out and luggage left in Cipriani's lobby, I race to the press screening of Sony Pictures Classics and Canadian David Cronenberg's highly anticipated A Dangerous Method, produced by Jeremy Thomas. \n\n\nThe film, set on the eve of World War I, is about Sigmund Freud and Carl Jung and their patient Sabina Spielrein, the Russian Jewess who for years remained uncredited for her influence on the development of modern psychology. \n\n\nThe cast features Michael Fassbender as Jung with Keira Knightley (queen of the costume dramas) as Spielrein. Yes, they are fully dressed in their famous sexually charged spanking scenes. This is just the warm up to Fassbender's raw and disturbing sexual romp through lower Manhattan on Sunday night in Shame, Jeremy Thomas's other film. Viggo Mortensen portrays Freud, Vincent Cassel is Austrian psychoanalyst Otto Gross and newcomer Sarah Gadon is Jung's wife. \n\n\nAt the press conference the cast jokes about drawing from their own madness as research and inspiration. I, on the other hand, am in a panic speeding back to Cipriani's to wheel my suitcases around the corner to the Bauer Palladio. Looking lost, dejected and pathetically disheveled, I thank God no one sees my fall from grace. \n\n\nI eventually realize I am missing a pair of small gold and diamond earrings. Oddly, the same thing happened to me last year during a room change. I chalk this up as the price of foolishly traveling with real jewelry. \n\n\nAt the premiere of A Dangerous Method, I am stressed because I have no ticket, having given my pair to Peter Brant and bed-robber Owen Wilson. Michael Barker and Tom Bernard escort me on the red carpet and Marco Muller himself walks me in.\n\n\nHaving seen A Dangerous Method this morning, I slip out and head to the first Gucci for Woman Award in Cinema dinner hosted by Frida Giannini in Cipriani's rustic barns previously ancient granaries, now donning elegant white Murano glass chandeliers. \n\n\nThis new award recognizes outstanding female filmmakers. The jury includes Robin Wright (who heads to Toronto next week to the premiere of Bennett Miller's Moneyball) and James Franco, also Toronto bound with Sal about Sal Mineo, and Valeria Golino, whom I met on Rain Man. \n\n\nMadonna asks for \"a drum roll, please,\" as she announces winner Jessica Chastain for Tree of Life . . . but it might as well be for the 11 films Chastain has made since being discovered by Al Pacino four years ago for Wilde Salome. Jessica is presently in The Help, The Dept, Take Shelter and Texas Killing Fields. She is also Toronto bound with Ralph Fiennes’ Coriolanus. This Julliard graduate is following in footsteps of the iconic Meryl Streep.\n\n\nFrancois-Henri Pinault, chairman of Gucci's parent company PRP, is headed to China to support their medical and educational foundations. Pinault’s wife Salma Hayek, wearing a Gucci gown embellished with crystals and feathers, discusses Oliver Stone's Savages, the film about Mexican drug lords that she is currently filming in Los Angeles. \n\n\nSuddenly a cake with sparklers appears for Salma's 45th—and Madonna encourages us to belt out \"Happy Birthday. Singing along is Ginevra Elkann, CAA's Hylda Queally, manager Jason Weinberg and the Brant boys, 18-year-old Petey and 15-year-old Harry.\n\n\nAcross the canal Luca Dini, editor of Vanity Fair Italy is hosting a dinner for David Cronenberg at the pink, Gothic, fifteenth-century Palazzo Pisani Moretta with original period furnishings. An official guidebook says, \"can rent out for sumptuous receptions and unforgettable parties.\" They are not kidding. Lit exclusively by candles mounted on hundreds of antique Murano glass chandeliers, the palace has no electricity or air conditioning. Venice is in the middle of a heat wave and at midnight it still feels like a sauna. Add 300 film patrons frantically fanning themselves with gifted fans, eating hot risotto and ravioli, and you have the hottest party I’ve ever been to. Literally. Keira, in her long-sleeved, gold lace Valentino is dabbing her body with ice water from the table.\n\n\nIronically a party for Contagion the following night had a dozen new, huge, white plastic air conditioners humming around the ballroom for the film about a global, pandemic plague.  \n\n\nSaturday, Sept. 3, 2011\n\n\nWith a noon checkout and a 3 p.m. check-in at Cipriani's, I am beside myself with packing fatigue and blowing $500 dollars a day on boat rides.\n\n\nI am watching Steven Soderbergh's sleek medical thriller Contagion aka Sars: The Movie with the A-list Hollywood cast including Matt Damon, Gwyneth Paltrow, Laurence Fishburne, Jennifer Ehle, Jude Law and Marion Cotillard. Michael Shamberg produces and Scott Z. Burns is the screenwriter. The film imagines a virus killing millions as scientists try desperately to find an antidote. It starts with peaky-looking Paltrow in a casino touching everything, chatting on a cell phone to a lover, coming home to her husband and expiring on the kitchen floor as she foams at the mouth. Gwyneth tells us this is accomplished by biting down on an alka-seltzer.   \n\n\nNext I find the documentary Diana Vreeland: The Eye Has to Travel hidden in a tiny screening room in a basement. Lisa Immordino Vreeland, married to Vreeland's grandson Alexander produces and directs. Clips from Vreeland's early life, career and family, visuals of her years at Harper's Bazaar, Vogue and the Metropolitan Museum of Art's Costume Institute along with interviews with Diane Sawyer, Andy Warhol, Calvin Klein, Oscar de la Renta and John Fairchild show a woman with a keen respect for cultural history and an original sense of style.     \n\n\nOn to lunch in honor of Lisa at Harry's Bar hosted by Diego Della Valle, President of the Tod's Group and Italian Vogue’s Franca Sozzani. Lisa’s husband Alexander and father Nichlos join Jessica Chastian, Eli Roth, Bar Rafaeli, Shala Monroque, Bianca Brandolini d'Adda and Countess Bianca Arrivabene. \n\n\nOnce again I am sweating and wheeling all of my luggage back to Cipriani's, praying I do not run into pregnant Beyonce celebrating her 30th birthday with husband Jay-Z. Finally, I am settled into a pool-side suite \n\n\nSunday, Sept. 4, 2011\n\n\nPress are lining up at 8 a.m. for the 9 a.m. screening of the steamy, evocative festival \"it\" film, Shame, directed by Steve McQueen, not the deceased white actor known for posing on a motorcycle, but a African Englishman who took the performer's name as his own. Michael Fassbender plays the tormented 30-something addicted to sex. Carey Mulligan is the wayward sister who moves into his apartment fostering chaos. She sings a chilling, slow sad blues version of \"New York, New York\" which was shot in the Boom Boom Room of the Standard Hotel. Ian Canning and Emile Sherman, producers of The King's Speech, sold this to Fox Searchlight, who will face the challenge of releasing a NC-17 movie.\n\n\nI am backstage in the green room with Al Pacino—the Merchant of Venice—moments before he enters a packed pressroom to discuss Wilde Salome, his passionate documentary and feature mélange based on Oscar Wilde's play, the biblical tale of Salome and King Herod which explores the destructive use of sexuality. From biblical times to the Boom Boom Room—it's a big day for dysfunctional, obsessive sex.\n\n\nAl, wearing a white silk loose shirt and sporting longish hair, looks like an escapee from Scarface. Jessica Chastain is about to explain her slithering, almost nude red scarf dance for King Herod. Al asks his second agent to write an acceptance speech for the Jagger-Le-Coultre Glory to Filmmaker Award he is to receive tonight.  \n\n\nThe agent stays calm but clearly does not have a clue who to email in Hollywood for help. Al eventually realizes he will go on stage tonight and wing it. Now, the Italian press goes nuts as their hometown boy, Michael Corleone, makes his way to the podium. I saw this exact, almost religious, reverence last year when Sophia Coppola was in this pressroom for Somewhere. The Godfather is Italy's sacred film and its filmmakers are their cinema saints. Al passionately charms his worshipers. As his entourage is escorted out of the building to the waiting water taxi past screaming fans, one zealous guy jumps into the canal swimming and chanting \"Al\" \"Al\" \"Al,\" with his arms in the air just like \"Attica\" \"Attica\" \"Attica,\" in Dog Day Afternoon. Al waves back.\n\n\nAl’s post-premiere dinner is at the Palazzo Grassi, built in 1740 and is now owned by Francois Pinault and used to exhibit his art collection. This is also where Amy Sacco transforms the lobby into her late-night, pop-up Bungalow 8 every evening. \n\n\nAl, with his luscious Argentinean Lucila Sola, along with producer Barry Navidi and entourage, end up poolside at Cipriani's eating bowls of pasta and ice cream. Gary Oldman, Laurence Fishburne, Peter Brant and Owen Wilson pay respects. Owen receives praise for Midnight in Paris. Princess Firyal of Jordan wants Al to pose for a photo with her niece. Even Joel Arthur Rosenthal, the reclusive, Parisian jewelry designer aka JAR, who’s also known for accessorizing everyone from Elizabeth Taylor to Ellen Barkin is thrilled to meet Al.\n\n\nMonday, Sept. 5, 2011\n\n\nMy ride to Venice is now going home via Geneva and Moscow without me. \n\n\nLiterary agent Lynn Nesbit and I go the premiere of Focus Feature's/John le Carre's Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy. English producer Tim Bevans, Swedish director Tomas Alfredson and John le Carre with their cast Gary Oldman, Colin Firth, John Hurt, Mark Strong and newcomer Benedict Cumberbatch, get standing ovations before and after the film from the spotlighted balcony. Missing is Tom Hardy, this year's hottest young actor.\n\n\nAfter Tinkers’ dinner, we head back to Cipriani's to Charles Finch and producer Ed Pressman's evening with Caroline Scheufele, Co-President of Chopard to celebrate The Moth Diaries. Lynn represents Rachel Klein, author of the bestselling book. We dine with director Mary Harron and her young actresses Sarah Gadon and Sarah Bolger. Missing is Lily Cole. Her flight is cancelled due to the national one-day labor strike.\n\n\nTuesday, Sept. 6, 2011\n\n\nFollowing the screenings of The Moth Diaries and a new version of Wuthering Heights with an African Heathcliff, I join Pressman and his cast of The Moth Diaries for lunch at the Excelsior. Jonathan Demme comes by. He is here with the post-Katrina New Orleans-set documentary, I'm Carolyn Parker: The Good, the Mad, and the Beautiful.\n\n\nWhile housekeeping packs my clothes, I conclude that this is the year Hollywood embraces launching their Oscar-bound films oversees. The race began in May on the beaches of Cannes where Midnight in Paris and The Artist debuted with black-tie galas nightly. \n\n\nLate August, American and English films dominate the Venice waterfront where Shame heats up amid more fancy parties in grand palazzos.  \n\n\nTiny Telluride, now showing more European films was the next stepping stone with a Western hometown casualness.\n\n\nSeptember was Toronto, the mother of all film festivals that premieres its new exhibition space, the Bell Lightbox and a smorgasbord of 250 films. Here was the most user-friendly, fashion-free film festival where one walked to four films a day. Moneyball brings Brad Pitt to town, who brings Angelina Jolie. International stars end up at the Soho House whispering about \"the race.\" \n\n\nEarly October is at Lincoln Center, home of The New York Film Festival that shows films that have debuted in the other festivals and await sanctioning from the American media and public. The academy members are yet to weigh in.\n\n\nOne ends up with the exhilarating feeling of experiencing world cinema through passionate festival curators giving support and clarity from directors to distributors and helping simple film fans like you and me. Let’s not forget the geniuses, Steven Speilberg, Stephen Daldry, Clint Eastwood, David Fincher, Martin Scorcese and Jason Reitman who have bypassed the festival route. Let the race begin.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                        2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

One such reasonable procedure would appear to be closed-circuit transmission of court proceedings to\na facility sufficiently large to accommodate all the victims. This was the procedure followed in the Oklahoma City bombing\ncase, 498\n\nBut tracking the CVRA is not enough. The language for my proposed rule comes from another statute, 42 U.S.C. ¢ 10608(a),\nwhich authorizes closed-circuit transmissions \"notwithstanding any provision of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure to the\n\ncontrary\" in cases in which a proceeding has been transferred more than 350 miles. 4°? The Advisory Committee repeatedly\nproposed folding language from the CVRA straight into the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. But if the goal is to fold\nstatutes into the Rules, other relevant victims’ statutes should be folded in as well.\n\nWhile folding in a provision on closed-circuit broadcasting, there appears to be no good reason to limit such transmissions to\nsuch situations where venue has been transferred. The CVRA mandates that the courts must always craft \"reasonable\nprocedures\" to protect the rights of multiple victims. °° The proposed rule simply authorizes courts to allow such\ntransmissions in appropriate cases. Interestingly, the CVRA's drafters specifically endorsed the closed-circuit procedure. >!\n\n[*950] For reasons that have yet to be articulated, the Advisory Committee has not only failed to act on my proposal but it has\nleft in place a conflict between a statute and Rule 53. As noted above, 42 U.S.C. § /0608(a) specifically trumps Rule 53 in\nsituations where cases have been transferred more than 350 miles. *°? The Rules should at least be amended to fix that conflict.\n\n503 While fixing that problem, the Advisory Committee should also adopt my change, which faithfully implements the CVRA's\ncommands.\n\n(New) Rule 60(a)(1) - Notice of Proceedings for Victims The Proposals:\nI proposed requiring federal prosecutors to give notice to crime victims of their rights and the court process as follows:\nRule 10.1 Notice to Victims.\n\n(a) Identification of Victim. During the prosecution of a case, the attorney for the government shall, at the earliest reasonable\nopportunity, identify the victims of the crime.\n\n(b) Notice of Case Events.

R. Crim. P. 53. But reliance on that language is a bit odd because it should go without\nsaying that nothing in the Rules can trump a substantive statute passed by Congress. See 28 U.S.C. § 2072(b). Moreover, as a simple matter\nof drafting clarity, it is desirable to have the Rules themselves avoid conflicts with statutes.

But if we want to address real issues, we need to discuss per-\nsonality and how to deal with it.\n\nI have insisted, as long as I have been discussing education,” that\nlearning has to be experientially based. I proposed building complex\nsocial simulators 20 years ago, and this has come to be understood by\nthe e-learning community as telling people they are in a situation that\nthey may or may not relate to instead of actually putting them into a\nvery realistic simulation of that situation. The reason they do it that\nway is money, of course, but something gets lost in the translation.\n\nWhat is the difference?\n\nSuppose that I tell you that you are a baseball player in the major\nleagues and your team is down by one run with one out in the bottom\nof the ninth with the bases loaded. I then give you a set of multiple\nchoices about what to do on the first pitch (like, a—take the first pitch,\nb—look for a fast ball, etc.). What is the problem with this? There are\nright answers about what to do, but they depend on many variables\n(Do you know this pitcher’s habits? How have you been hitting today?\nHow fast is the guy on third?). Pretending that we can abstract a situa-\ntion with a simple description and then suggest there is a right answer,\nis absurd. But more important, if you have never actually been in that\nsituation, if you have never played baseball, your comprehension of\nthe unmentioned details is likely to be zero. Attempting to teach any-\nthing through short descriptions of situations followed by multiple\nchoice answers is just dumb.\n\nWhy, then, do e-learning companies keep on building courses that\nsound like that? Usually the answer is that corporations that don’t\nknow any better asked them to.\n\nWhat does this have to do with altering basic behavior? I do in-\ndeed play baseball, as I have said, and what I would do in that situ-\nation depends on my personality in many ways. It also depends on\nan accurate assessment of my own abilities. What it doesn’t depend\non is deep thought. Professional athletes do not become professional\nathletes owing to their superior cognitive abilities. They have superior\nphysical abilities and rely on instinct for thinking. They do what they\n“know” to do. They don’t think it out.

Wood biomass fuel has an annual capacity of 12.6 million tons per year and\nproduces ~675 GWh per year in energy. Access to local refineries is key to utilizing hemp\nbiomass as a cellulosic biofuel.

The CO2 method is\nable to isolate CBD at a 90% efficiency and is typically used when producing small\nquantities. Ethanol extraction introduces the hemp plant to solvent ethanol and enables\nhigher volumes production. In addition to hemp-based production of CBD, we believe\nthe opportunity exists for players within the biochemical space to produce CBD by\nutilizing a fermentation approach from other feedstocks. Amyris recently announced a\n$255 million cannabinoid development, licensing and commercialization agreement.\nAmyris plans to utilize the C5 molecule found in sugarcane in a fermentation process to\nproduce CBD. The company believes that the fermentation process ensures a level of\npurity that is not possible through traditional plant-based production, where CBD levels\ncan vary from plant to plant. In order to build out the industrial scale necessary for mass\nfood market, CBD products will need to be produced at standardized levels.

Both positions are based on category mistake. No\none has ever seriously suggested that a president can never be indicted. The only debate is\nwhether any indictment of a president must be postponed until he is no longer in office.\nSince any president can indisputably be indicted when no longer in office, there 1s no\npermanent immunity that would obviate questioning of a president.\n\n6. The 2000 OLC Memorandum. This opinion of the Office of Legal Counsel, signed by\nAssistant Attorney General Randolph Moss, is a thorough and thoughtful analysis of\nwhether a president can be indicted and prosecuted while serving in office. It appears to\nhave originally been drafted during the time of the Starr investigation of President Bill\nClinton. The case against putting a president on trial is fully convincing to me. What is not\nso clear, however, is whether there is sound basis for withholding an indictment of a\npresident even if any trial proceedings must await the end of his term. Like the Dixon memo,\nthe 2000 opinion set out several obstacles to trying a president. None of those reasons, save\none, applies to naming a president in an indictment.\n\nThe 2000 opinion gives so little thought to the possibility of indicting-and-postponing that it\ngives only one reason why such a course should be precluded: the idea that including the\npresident in an indictment would cast a “cloud” over the presidency. The notion that\nreputational harm alone should preclude a normal part of the system of justice seems\nincompatible with the Supreme Court’s decision in Clinton v. Jones, in which the court set\nsuch a high bar for any presidential immunity from the normal process of litigation that not a\nsingle justice found that actually undergoing a civil trial was precluded.\n\nIt is hard to square mere reputational harm as a basis for precluding indictment when the\ngovernment seems to have established that a president can be listed as an unindicted co-\nconspirator. The reputational difference between being named as an unindicted co-\nconspirator in a criminal indictment and being listed as one of those indicted seems\nrelatively small. The essential difference: naming one as indicted prevents the statute of\nlimitations from expiring. Why, for a small reputational difference, would one choose to\nmake being in the White House a basis for permanently precluding (by operation of the\nstatute of limitations) an otherwise warranted criminal prosecution?\n\nOne aspect of the 2000 memo is worth noting. It appears to have been drafted with the case\nagainst President Clinton in mind. That was essentially a one-defendant matter. Thus, the\nopinion does not grapple with the significant obstacles to trying a multi-defendant criminal\nconspiracy while excluding from the charging document any reference to one of the\nconspirators—and perhaps a key conspirator.\n\nFor an extended argument that the terms of Robert Mueller’s appointment and practice of\nthe Office of Legal Counsel do not require him to conform to the 2000 OLC position\nopinion rejecting the option of indicting and postponing, see Andrew Crespo’s analysis. In\naddition to Crespo’s analysis, I would add that the 2000 memo gives only scant attention to\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_030206\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

If changes are made that better serve the president by\nforcing people to think through policy options in the context of objectives and strategies, those\nchanges should not reflect poorly on the stewardship of her predecessor. The president gets\nprecisely the national security system he mandates and deserves. He is, as JFK noted in the\nimmediate wake of the Bay of Pigs fiasco, \"the responsible officer of government.\"\n\nIn the end it is the president, and not the Blackberry or some other device, who will drive the direction\nand processes of foreign policy and diplomacy. It is up to him to tell his national security advisor that\nhe wants the interagency to stop tweeting and start thinking; to tell him how he should be evaluating\nUS national security objectives with respect to Syria (for example) and strategy options aimed at\naccomplishing them. This kind of deliberative process will not require people to wear powdered wigs\nand inscribe talking points on parchment with quill pens. It will not even oblige them to disconnect\nelectronically.\n\nPerhaps the biggest obstacle to an orderly national security process that is deliberative is the sheer\nbrainpower of the people sitting atop the bureaucratic pyramid. Barack Obama and Susan Rice are\namong the very brightest people to serve in the US government. They may think they can figure Syria\nout themselves, within a small circle of trusted political advisers. They may think they can handle\nSyria without reaching beyond their own national security staff, without probing deeply into the\nDepartments of State, Defense, the intelligence community, and elsewhere where additional\nexpertise resides. They will outsmart themselves if that is the approach they choose.\n\nBlackberry diplomacy is a choice, not a device decision and certainly not a fact of life. Even in this\nday and age, it is possible to figure out what one wants and how to go about getting it: even in\ngovernment work.\n\ndentons.com\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_030212\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

The Supreme Court\nresolved two questions in Dole Food. “The\nfirst [was] whether a corporate subsidiary\ncan claim instrumentality status where the\nforeign state does not own a majority of its\nshares but does own a majority of the\nshares of a corporate parent one or more\ntiers above the subsidiary. The second\nquestion [was] whether a corporation’s in-\nstrumentality status is defined as of the\ntime an alleged tort or other actionable\nwrong occurred or, on the other hand, at\nthe time the suit is filed.” Jd. at 471, 128\nS.Ct. 1655. The Supreme Court held that\na foreign state’s ownership of an entity\nmust be direct for the entity to be consid-\nered an instrumentality. Jd. at 474, 123\nS.Ct. 1655. The Supreme Court also ruled\nthat ownership must be determined as of\nthe date on which the complaint was filed.\nId. at 480, 123 S.Ct. 1655. Neither of\nthese points of law speaks, however, to the\ncircumstances under which an individual is\ncovered by the FSIA. Indeed, numerous\nother courts that have addressed this issue\nhave held that the relevant inquiry for\nindividuals is simply whether the acts in\nquestion were undertaken at a time when\nthe individual was acting in an official ca-\npacity. See, e.g., Velasco, 370 F.3d at 398—\n99; Byrd, 182 F.3d at 388; Bryks, 906\nF.Supp. at 210. This Court considers that\nprecedent to be more consistent with the\nFSIA and unaltered by the decision in\nDole Food. Thus, it deems Prince Turki\nthe equivalent of the foreign state inas-\n\n24. After the parties submitted their briefs and\nargued the FSIA issue, the Ashton Plaintiffs\nfiled supplemental affidavits, without leave of\nthe Court, to contest, for the first time, the\ntiming of the PIF’s majority ownership. See\n03 MD 1570 Docket # 455. The parties agree\nthat the PIF bought 50% of NCB shares in\nMay 1999. See John Fawcett Sept. 23, 2004\nSupplemental Affidavit at Ex. 1 (“Fawcett\nSupp. Aff.”). Later in 1999, the PIF sold 10%\nof its shares to the General Organization for\n\nmuch as the complaints allege actions tak-\nen in his official capacity as the head of the\nDGI. Accordingly, both Prince Sultan and\nPrince Turki are immune from suit for\ntheir official acts unless an exception un-\nder the FSIA applies.\n\n2. National Commercial Bank\n\nNCB submits that it is an instrumentali-\nty of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and\ntherefore immune from suit. See Decl. of\nNizar Bin Obaid Madani, Assistant Minis-\nter of Foreign Affairs of Kingdom of Saudi\nArabia 12, at Berger Decl. Ex. 7 (“It is\nthe position of the Ministry of Foreign\nAffairs that NCB is a government instru-\nmentality of the Kingdom of Saudi Ara-\nbia.”). To enjoy immunity from suit under\nthe FSIA, NCB must demonstrate that it\nis an agency or instrumentality, or a politi-\ncal subdivision of the Kingdom. 28 U.S.C.\n§ 1603(a). As explained above, the FSIA\ndefines an “agency or instrumentality” as\n(1) “a separate legal person, ...(2) which\nis an organ of a foreign state or political\nsubdivision thereof, or a majority of whose\nshares or other ownership interest is\nowned by a foreign state or political subdi-\nvision thereof,” and (@) a non-U.S. citizen.\n28 U.S.C. § 160300). Accordingly, NCB\nclaims that (1) it is a separate legal person,\n(2) at the time the suit was filed a majority\nof its shares were owned by an administra-\ntive unit of the Saudi Ministry of Finance,\nthe Public Investment Fund (““PIF”),”4 and\n(8) it is not a citizen of the United States\n\nSocial Insurance.

In the previous\nchapter we discussed what can’t be taught. Now, let’s talk about what\ncan be taught.\n\nOne problem in such a discussion is that we are used to (because we\nwent to school) thinking about what needs to be taught and learned\nin terms of subjects (English, math, science, etc.). We think this way\nbecause school originally was organized by professors who had spe-\ncialties in these subject areas. These professors were scholars and they\nset up the lower schools on the basis of the specialties that they had.\n\nWhen I was working in artificial intelligence, I began to realize\nthat what I needed to teach the computer to do in order for it be smart\nwas a far cry from what people thought needed to be taught. People\nassumed that we needed to tell the computer facts about the world of\nthe type that children learn in school, and that this would make the\nmachine smart. (Quite recently, I attended a meeting of AI people who\nwere planning a project to allow computers to pass SAT tests as a way\nof showing that the computer was smart!)\n\nBut what computers lack is intelligent capabilities, not information.\nIt is easy enough to fill a machine with information, but when you are\ndone, it would be able to tell you only what you told it. (If that was what\na child did, you would think that he was brain damaged.) Intelligence\nand the learning required to create useful new knowledge are really a\nresult of an amalgamation of cognitive processes. Intelligent computers,\nand intelligent people, need those processes to be working well.\n\n45\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_023791\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

Even on their baseline medications, the\npatients were experiencing a median baseline drop seizure frequency of 74 per month.\nThe average age of patients in the trial was 15 years, although 34% were 18 years or\nolder. On the primary endpoint, Epidiolex produced a median reduction in monthly drop\nseizures of 44% compared to a reduction of 22% in patients taking placebo (p=0.0135).\nEpidiolex reduced all seizures by 41% vs. a 14% reduction for placebo (p=0.0005), while\nthe reduction in all seizures during the maintenance period was 45% for Epidiolex vs.\n15% for placebo (p=0.0004). Similar to the Dravet trial, there was a clear separation\nbetween Epidiolex and placebo on percent reduction in drop seizure frequency across all\nmagnitudes of reduction. In particular, 44% of Epidiolex patients had at least a 50%\nreduction in drop seizures, compared to 24% of patients taking placebo (p=0.0043). 58%\nof Epidiolex patients compared to 34% of placebo patients were rated as \"slightly\nimproved\", “much improved\" or “very much improved\" on the Subject/Caregiver Global\nImpression of Change.\n\nEpidiolex appeared to be well tolerated in the trial. 86% of patients on Epdiolex had an\nadverse event, compared to 69% of placebo patients. The most common adverse events\nwere diarrhea (19% of patients on Epidiolex vs. 8% of placebo patients), somnolence\n(15% vs. 9%), pyrexia (13% vs. 8%), decreased appetite (13% vs. 2%) and vomiting (11%\nvs. 17%). Again, there was no difference in the number of patients who experienced\nstatus epilepticus between Epidiolex (n=1) and placebo (n=1). There was one death in\nthe Epidiolex group from acute respiratory distress syndrome, but it was not considered\ntreatment related. Increases in ALT or AST (>3xULN) occurred in 20 CBD and 1 placebo\npatient, all of whom were on concomitant valproic acid.

And this war is, I think,\nmetastasizing far quicker than governments can handle it.\n\nIf you look at what’s happening in ISIS, which is the Islamic State of Syria and the Levant,\nthat is now currently forming the caliphate that is having a military drive on Baghdad, if\nyou look at the sophistication of which they’ve taken the tools of capitalism. If you look at\nwhat they’ve done with Twitter and Facebook and modern ways to fundraise, and to use\ncrowdsourcing to fund, besides all the access to weapons, over the last couple days they\nhave had a radical program of taking kids and trying to turn them into bombers. They have\ndriven 50,000 Christians out of a town near the Kurdish border. We have video that we’re\nputting up later today on Breitbart where they've took 50 hostages and thrown them off a\ncliff in Iraq.\n\nThat war is expanding and it’s metastasizing to sub-Saharan Africa. We have Boko Haram\nand other groups that will eventually partner with ISIS in this global war, and it is,\nunfortunately, something that we’re going to have to face, and we’re going to have to face\nvery quickly.\n\nSo I think the discussion of, should we put a cap on wealth creation and distribution? It’s\nsomething that should be at the heart of every Christian that is a capitalist — “What is the\npurpose of whatever I’m doing with this wealth? What is the purpose of what I’m doing\nwith the ability that God has given us, that divine providence has given us to actually be a\ncreator of jobs and a creator of wealth?”\n\nI think it really behooves all of us to really take a hard look and make sure that we are\nreinvesting that back into positive things. But also to make sure that we understand that\nwe're at the very beginning stages of a global conflict, and if we do not bind together as\npartners with others in other countries that this conflict is only going to metastasize.\nThey have a Twitter account up today, ISIS does, about turning the United States into a\n“river of blood” if it comes in and tries to defend the city of Baghdad. And trust me, that is\ngoing to come to Europe. That is going to come to Central Europe, it’s going to come to\nWestern Europe, it’s going to come to the United Kingdom. And so J think we are ina\ncrisis of the underpinnings of capitalism, and on top of that we’re now, I believe, at the\n\nbeginning stages of a global war against Islamic fascism.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_029025\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

In a variety of species, from dung beetles to deer, biologists have\ndeveloped mathematical models that accurately predict how long an individual should wait for a sexual\npartner or feed in a food patch. The accuracy of these models shows that individuals’ desires for resources\nlinked to survival and reproduction are captured by lawful principles or rules. This is important because it\nmeans we understand how the machine underlying behavior works. It means we understand how animals\nmake certain choices.\n\nUnderstanding how wanting works is straightforward. In both humans and nonhuman animals,\nwe can measure what individuals approach when we give them a choice, as well as how much effort they\nare willing to exert while approaching and gaining access to a particular object or experience. For\nexample, in studies that explore whether captive animals are provided with sufficient housing conditions,\nan experimenter presents individuals with a choice of rooms, one consisting of the typical housing\nenvironment and the others by the addition of goods believed to be of interest. To enter a given room\nrequires opening a door. To determine how much an individual really wants what is in another room, the\nexperimenter ramped up the difficulty of opening each door. In studies of captive hens and mongoose,\nindividuals exerted considerable effort to open some doors but not others. Hens rammed into doors\nopening onto a chipped wood floor, whereas mongoose did the same for a pool of water. These are items\nthey want, but do not get in captivity.\n\nWhat about liking? It may seem, at first blush, that because liking is a subjective experience, that\nthere are no clear objective ways to measure it. My likes are my own. You can’t possibly know what it\nis like to be me. If you can’t know what it is like to be me, then we can’t possibly know what it is like to\nbe a mongoose, mouse or monkey. There are, however, ways of measuring liking and disliking that are\nreliable, objective, and consistent across species. In many animals, including human babies who can’t\nspeak and human adults who have lost this capacity due to brain injury, there are distinctive behaviors\nthat are consistently linked to positive experiences and others linked to negative ones. For example, in\nmice, monkeys, and human babies, tasting something sweet like sugar causes a lot of lip licking, whereas\ntasting something bitter such as quinine causes mouth gaping, nose twitching, and arm flailing. These\nsimilarities show that evolution has been conservative, maintaining the same underlying mechanisms for\nhandling likes and dislikes. These similarities have enabled scientists to understand how the brain systems\ninvolved in wanting and liking can change together or separately, even though they can’t help us\nunderstand the harder problem of what, in particular, it is like for a given mouse, monkey or man to like\nsomething.\n\nTo understand the machinery that drives rodent wants or desire, Susana Pecifia and Kent Berridge\n\ntook advantage of the genetic technique that Joe Tsien —mentioned in the last chapter — used to create\n\nHauser Chapter 2.

Edwards, by and through his undersigned counsel, hereby\nsubmits this Response in Opposition to Plaintiff/Counter-Defendant Jeffrey Epstein's Motion for\nSummary Judgment. Epstein seeks Summary Judgment on the claims of abuse of process and malicious\nprosecution set forth in Brad Edwards' Fourth Amended Counterclaim. Each of the grounds asserted in\nsupport of Epstein's Motion for Summary Judgment are without merit and must be denied.\nIn Epstein's Amended Complaint he carries forth the essence of all claims asserted in his original\nComplaint. In that pleading Epstein essentially alleges that Edwards joined Rothstein in the abusive\nprosecution of sexual assault cases against Epstein to \"pump\" the cases to Ponzi scheme investors. The\npurported \"proof' of the allegations against Edwards, as referenced in the Second Amended Complaint\nand in Epstein's Motion for Summary Judgment, includes Edwards' alleged contacts with the media, his\nattempts to obtain discovery from high profile persons with whom Epstein socialized, press reports of\nRothstein's known illegal activities, the use of \"ridiculously inflammatory' language and arguments in\ncourt. But as the evidence submitted in opposition to Epstein's Motion for Summary Judgment reflects,\nEpstein filed his claims and continued to pursue claims despite his knowledge that his claims could never\nbe successful because they were both false and unsupported by any reasonable belief of suspicion that\nCase No.: 502009 CA040800XXXXIVIBAG\nEdwards' Opposition to Epstein's Motion for Summary Judgment\nPage 2 of 15\nthey were true. Epstein knew that he had in fact molested each of the minors represented by Brad\nEdwards. He also knew that each litigation decision by Brad Edwards was grounded in proper litigation\njudgment about the need to pursue effective discovery against Epstein, particularly in the face of\nEpstein's stonewalling tactics.\nEpstein also knew that he suffered no legally cognizable injury\nproximately caused by the falsely alleged wrongdoing on the part of Edwards. Moreover, Epstein had no\nintention of waiving his Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination in order to avoid providing\nrelevant and material discovery that Epstein would need in the course of prosecuting his claims and to\nwhich Edwards was entitled in defending those claims. Epstein knew that his prosecution of his claims\nwould be barred by the sword-shield doctrine.\nMost significantly, the evidence submitted in the\nsupporting papers would compel a fact finder to determine that Epstein had no basis in law or in fact to\npursue his claims against Edwards and that Epstein was motivated by a single ulterior motive to attempt\nto intimidate Edwards and his clients and others into abandoning or settling their legitimate claims for\nless than their just and reasonable value. The evidence demonstrates that Epstein did not file these claims\nfor the purpose of collecting money damages since he knew that he never suffered any damage as a\nconsequence of any alleged wrongdoing by Edwards but filed the claim to require Edwards to expend\ntime, energy and resources on his own defense, to embarrass Edwards and impugn his integrity and deter\nothers with legitimate claims against Epstein from pursuing those claims.\nIndeed, the evidence\ndemonstrates that Epstein continued to pursue his claims by filing the Second Amended Complaint\nalleging abuse of process against Edwards even after he had paid significant sums in settlement of the\nclaims instituted by Mr. Edwards' clients against Mr. Epstein!\nThe evidence marshalled in support of these assertions is set forth in the previously filed documents in this Court.\nThose documents include Exhibit \"A\" — Edwards' Statement of Undisputed Facts; Exhibit \"B\" — Edwards' Renewed\nMotion for Summary Judgment; Exhibit \"C\" — Edwards' October 19, 2012 Second Renewed Motion for Leave to\nAssert Claim for Punitive Damages; Exhibit \"D\" — Edwards' Notice of Filing of Transcript of Telephone Interview\nof Virginia Roberts in Support of Motion for Leave to Amended to Assert Punitive Damages; Exhibit \"E\" —\nTranscript of Deposition of Jeffrey Epstein dated January 25, 2012; Exhibit \"F' — Deposition of Bradley Edwards\ndated March 23, 2010; Exhibit \"G\" - Deposition of Scott Rothstein dated June 14, 2012; Exhibit \"H\" — Order of\nCase No.: 502009CA040800XXXXMBAG\nEdwards' Opposition to Epstein's Motion for Summary Judgment\nPage 3 of 15\nThe record reflects that on the eve of the hearing of Edwards' Motion for Summary Judgment\ndirected to the Second Amended Complaint and in light of the compelling evidence of the lack of any\nwrongdoing on the part of Mr. Edwards, the sole remaining abuse of process claim was dismissed by\nEpstein.\nAs discussed, infra each of the grounds asserted by Epstein in this Motion for Summary\nJudgment must be rejected. The litigation privilege does not serve as a bar to the prosecution of Edwards'\nclaims against Epstein. Moreover, the evidence submitted by Edwards supports each of the elements of\nthe claims asserted by Edwards against Epstein which are identified in Epstein's Motion.\nResponse to Epstein's Statement of Undisputed Facts\nThe evidence marshalled by Edwards in support of his claims against Epstein which are\nreferenced in footnote 1 mandates the conclusion that, at a minimum, disputed facts exist with respect to\nthe elements of each claim addressed by Epstein in his Motion. The facts presented in the various papers\nwould allow the jury to make a determination that Epstein knew that Brad Edwards properly exercised his\nlegitimate judgment regarding the need to pursue proper and effective discovery against him to support\nthe claims which Epstein knew were legitimate. That evidence, referenced herein, further demonstrated\nthat Epstein filed his claims without probable cause and further that there was a bonafide termination in\nfavor of Edwards. That evidence further demonstrates that the elements of the claim of abusive process\nhave been established.\nThe following additional comments are directed at some of the key purported \"undisputed\"\nmaterial facts asserted by Epstein, especially those referenced in his Memorandum of Law. Also set forth\nare key evidentiary matters which undermine Epstein's contentions and which support the proposition\nthat material issues of fact exist which compel the denial of the Motion for Summary Judgment.\nJudge Crow dated March 29, 2012; Exhibit \"I\" — Deposition of Bradley Edwards dated October 10, 2013; Exhibit\n\"J\" — Deposition of Bradley Edwards dated May 15, 2013.\nCase No.: 502009CA040800XXXX.MBAG\nEdwards' Opposition to Epstein's Motion for Summary Judgment\nPage 4 of 15\nNone of the public materials identified by Epstein in his Motion make reference to any\nwrongdoing by Brad Edwards. Rather, Epstein seeks to pyramid one impermissible inference upon\nanother from his citation to these materials to support his otherwise unsubstantiated and non-verifiable\nconclusion that he had sufficient evidence to proceed with claims of wrongdoing against Edwards. In\ntruth, as reflected in Edwards' deposition and his supplemental affidavit, he has no involvement in any\nfraud perpetrated by Rothstein (Edwards' deposition of March 23, 2010 at 301-302; Edwards Affidavit\nattached to Statement of Undisputed Facts as Exhibit \"N\" at paragraphs 8-10, paragraph 20, paragraphs\n22-23; Exhibit \"H\" — Deposition of Scott Rothstein at pp. 62-63, 114, and 121-124). Therefore, any\nallegations relating to Rothstein's activities simply have no bearing on the legitimacy of any of the claims\nagainst Edwards.\nEdwards could not have possibly \"pumped\" cases to investors when he never\nparticipated in any communications with investors. Rather, Edwards had a duty to his clients to zealously\npursue discovery to achieve a maximum recovery against Epstein. Edwards cannot be liable for taking\nappropriate action that his ethical duties as an attorney required. The evidence also reflects that Edwards\nfiled all three of his cases almost a year before he was hired by RRA or even knew Scott Rothstein\n(Edwards' Affidavit, Exhibit \"N\" attached to Statement of Undisputed Facts). The language set forth in\nhis Complaints remain virtually unchanged from the first filing in 2008 and, as the evidence shows, the\nclaims asserted against Epstein from the outset were true.\nThe citation to public documents is a\nconvenient ruse; Epstein was not only liable for the molestation of the clients of Brad Edwards, he was\nalso a serial molester of minors — even as young as twelve years of age\n(Exhibit \"A\" — Edwards'\nStatement of Undisputed Material Facts paragraphs 1-43; Exhibit \"D\" — Statement of Virginia Roberts pp.\n16-17). Epstein entered a plea of guilty to felony charges involving prostitution and the solicitation of a\nminor for the purposes of prostitution (Exhibit \"E\" — Deposition of Jeffrey Epstein, March 17, 2010, pp.\n101-103). Epstein also entered into an agreement with the United States Attorney's Office\nacknowledging that approximately 34 other young girls could receive payments from him under the\nCase No.: 502009CA040800XXXXMBAG\nEdwards' Opposition to Epstein's Motion for Summary Judgment\nPage 5 of 15\nFederal Statute providing for compensation to victims of child abuse..\n(Exhibit \"N' — Edwards'\nStatement of Undisputed Material Facts, paragraphs 41-43).\nOn July 6, 2010 Epstein ultimately paid to settle all three of the cases Edwards had filed against\nhim (Exhibit \"N' — Edwards' Statement of Undisputed Material Facts, paragraphs 84-85). At Epstein's\nrequest, the terms of the settlement were kept confidential. The sum that he paid to settle all these cases\nin therefore not filed with this pleading and will be provided to the court for in camera review. Epstein\nchose to make this payment as a result of a Federal Court ordered mediation process which he himself\nsought. Epstein entered into the settlements in July 2010 more than seven months after he filed his\nlawsuit against Edwards and before he filed his Second Amended Complaint alleging abuse of process on\nAugust 22, 2011.\nFurther, Epstein could not have been the victim of any scheme to pump the cases against him\nbecause he never paid to settle the cases until well after Edwards had left RRA and severed all connection\nwith Rothstein in December 2009 (Edwards' Affidavit attached to Statement of Undisputed Facts as\nExhibit \"N,\" paragraph 20). Moreover, Epstein could not have suffered any damage as a result of the\nperpetration of the Ponzi scheme by Rothstein because he was not an investor in the scheme.\nPerhaps the most significant evidence presented in opposition to Epstein's Motion for Summary\nJudgment is the telephone interview of Virginia Roberts submitted in Support of Edwards' Motion for\nPunitive Damages (Exhibit \"D\"). In addition to the specious claims against Edwards relating to his\nalleged involvement in a Ponzi scheme, Epstein, in asserting his claims, primarily relied upon the pursuit\nby Edwards of testimony from his close friends and associates (See Second Amended Complaint,\nparagraph 32, pp. 11-13). Reliance on these assertions is also threaded through Epstein's Motion for\nSummary Judgment in his citation to the public documents referencing the pursuit of such discovery. But\nas set forth in detail in Edwards' Motion for Final Summary Judgment (Exhibit \"B\") at pages 14-16, that\ndiscovery was entirely appropriate and Epstein knew it. Specifically, as reflected in the statement of\nCase No.: 502009CA040800XXXXMBAG\nEdwards' Opposition to Epstein's Motion for Summary Judgment\nPage 6 of 15\nundisputed facts submitted by Mr. Edwards in support of his Motion for Summary Judgment, Edwards\nhad a sound legal basis for believing that Donald Trump, Allen Dershowitz, Bill Clinton, Tommy\nMattola, David Copperfield and Governor Bill Richardson had relevant and discoverable information\n(Exhibit \"A\" — Edwards' Statement of Undisputed Facts, paragraphs 69-81). That belief was reinforced\nby the testimony of Virginia Roberts (Exhibit \"D\" pp. 10-17, 21-23). Epstein's assertion of impropriety\nin the pursuit of this discovery clearly evidences his bad faith attempts to attribute wrongdoing to\nEdwards when he knew, in fact, that the pursuit of that discovery was entirely appropriate under the\ncircumstances of this case.\nFinally, any attempt by Epstein to rely upon what he claims are undisputed facts to support his\nMotion for Summary Judgment are undermined by his refusal to provide any testimony on the key issues\nand evidence which would demonstrate the validity and strength of each of the claims brought against\nhim by Brad Edwards. Epstein's depositions of March 17, 2010 and January 25, 2012 were replete with\nrefusals of Epstein to testify based upon his Fifth Amendment privilege. Questions that Epstein refused\nto answer in his depositions and the reasonable inferences that a fact finder would draw and which would\notherwise bear on the arguments submitted by Epstein in support of his Motion for Summary Judgment\nare as follows:\n• Question not answered: \"I want to know whether you have any knowledge of evidence\nthat Bradley Edwards personally ever participated in devising a plan through which were\nsold purported confidential assignments of a structured payout settlement?\" Reasonable\ninference: No knowledge that Brad Edwards ever participated in the Ponzi scheme.\no\no\nQuestion not answered: \"Specifically what are the allegations against you which you\ncontend Mr. Edwards ginned up?\" Reasonable inference: No allegations against Epstein\nwere ginned up.\nQuestion not answered: \"Well, which of Mr. Edwards' cases do you contend were\nfabricated?\" Reasonable inference: No cases filed by Edwards against Epstein were\nfabricated.\nCase No.: 502009CA040800XXXXMBAG\nEdwards' Opposition to Epstein's Motion for Summary Judgment\nPage 7 of 15\n• Question not answered: \"Did sexual assaults ever take place on a private airplane on\nwhich you were a passenger?\" Reasonable inference: Epstein was on a private airplane\nwhile sexual assaults were taking place.\n• Question not answered: \"How many minors have you procured for prostitution?\"\nReasonable inference: Epstein has procured multiple minors for prostitution.\n• Question not answered: \"Is there anything in L.M.'s Complaint that was filed against\nyou in September of 2008 which you contend to be false?\" Reasonable inference:\nNothing in L.M.'s complaint filed in September of 2008 was false — i.e., as alleged in\nL.M.'s complaint, Epstein repeatedly sexually assaulted her while she was a minor and\nshe was entitled to substantial compensatory and punitive damages as a result.\n• Question not answered: \"I would like to know whether you ever had any physical\ncontact with the person referred to as Jane Doe in that [federal] complaint?\" Reasonable\ninference: Epstein had physical contact with minor Jane Doe as alleged in her federal\ncomplaint.\n• Question not answered: \"Did you ever have any physical contact with E.W.?\"\nReasonable inference: Epstein had physical contact with minor E.W. as alleged in her\ncomplaint.\n• Question not answered: \"What is the actual value that you contend the claim of E.W.\nagainst you has?\" Reasonable inference: E.W.'s claim against Epstein had substantial\nactual value.\n(See Exhibit \"A\" — Edwards' Statement of Undisputed Material Facts, paragraphs 93-120\nfor page references.)\nA jury could conclude, therefore, from the adverse inferences drawn against Epstein that he was\nliable for the claims brought by Brad Edwards and that he had no basis for the pursuit of his efforts to\nintimidate and extort Edwards and his clients in the pursuit of those claims.\nThe Litigation Privilege Does Not Bar the Claims of Abuse of Process and Malicious Prosecution\nEpstein contends he is entitled to absolute immunity pursuant to the litigation privilege as to both\nclaims asserted by Edwards because all actions taken by him occurred during the litigation of his abuse of\nprocess claim against Edwards. For support, he relies primarily on the decision of Wolfe v. Foreman,\n2013 WL 3724763 (Fla. 3d DCA July 17, 2013), wherein the Third District found that the litigation\nprivilege barred both an abuse of process claim and a malicious prosecution cause of action. Wolfe is still\nCase No.: 502009CA040800XXXXMBAG\nEdwards' Opposition to Epstein's Motion for Summary Judgment\nPage 8 of 15\non rehearing and, thus, is not a final opinion. As a result, it is not binding, nor persuasive. Moreover,\nWolfe undercuts the long-standing recognition of the viability of a claim for malicious prosecution in its\nown District and other Florida state and federal courts. See, SCI Funeral Svs. of Fla., Inc. v. Henry, 839\nSo. 2d 702, n.4 (Fla. 3d DCA 2002) (\"As the Levin court cited Wright v. Yurko, 446 So. 2d 1162, 1165\n(Fla. 5th DCA, 1984), with approval, presumably the cause of action for malicious prosecution continues\nto exist and would not be barred by the litigation privilege.\"); Boca Investors Group, Inc. v. Potash, 835\nSo. 2d 273, 275 (Fla. 3d DCA 2002) (Cope, J., concurring) (litigation privilege would not be a bar to a\nmalicious prosecution action); North Star Capital Acquisitions, LLC v. Krig, 611 Fed. Supp. 2d 1324\n(M.D. Fla. 2009) (\"However, not every event bearing any relation to litigation is protected by the\nprivileged because,... \"if the litigation privilege applied to all actions preliminary to or during judicial\nproceedings, an abuse of process claim would never exist, nor would a claim for malicious prosecution\");\nCruz v. Angelides, 574 So. 2d 278 (Fla. 3d DCA 1991)(\"the law is well settled that a witness in a judicial\nproceeding,... is absolutely immune from any civil liability, save perhaps malicious prosecution, for\ntestimony or other sworn statements which he or she gives in the course of the subject proceeding.\");\nJohnson v. Libow, 2012 WL 4068409 (Fla. 15th Jud. Cir. March 1, 2012)(the purpose of the litigation\nprivilege does not preclude the tort of malicious prosecution).\nIn Wright v. Yurko supra, the Fifth District Court of Appeal rejected the application of the\nlitigation privilege to a malicious prosecution action brought by a physician against his patients and an\nexpert after he successfully defended a malpractice claim. Also of significance is the Second District's\nopinion in Olson v. Johnson, 961 So. 2d 351 (Fla. 2d DCA 2007). In that case, the court observed that the\nlitigation (or judicial) privilege would not apply to bar a malicious prosecution action which arose as a\nresult of a false accusation of criminal liability where the prosecution was based, in part, on the testimony\nof the defendants in the criminal case.\nThe court ruled that the privilege (either absolute or qualified)\nCase No.: 502009CA040800XXXXMBAG\nEdwards' Opposition to Epstein's Motion for Summary Judgment\nPage 9 of 15\nwhich might otherwise apply to a defamation claim for statements made during the course of a judicial\nproceeding did not bar a malicious prosecution claim.\nIn light of the implicit recognition by the Supreme Court in Levin that a claim of malicious\nprosecution is not barred by the litigation privilege — an implicit recognition acknowledged by the Third\nDistrict itself — Epstein's reliance on Wolfe is misplaced. Wolfe is also factually distinguishable from\nEdwards' claims against Epstein.\nWolfe involved a malicious prosecution action against attorneys.\nSeparate policy considerations might serve to impose additional limitations on the assertion of malicious\nprosecution claims against attorneys — against whom alternative remedies exist such as bar disciplinary\nproceedings. See Taylor v. McNichols, 243 P.2d 642 (Idaho 2010). Moreover, in light of the decisions in\nWright v. Yurko, supra and Olson v. Johnson, supra, the weight of authority supports the proposition that\nthe litigation privilege would not apply to malicious prosecution claims.\nBoth the Third and Fourth Districts have applied the litigation privilege to abuse of process\nclaims. However, Wolfe itself, and the decisions of the Third and Fourth Districts cited in Wolfe,\ninvolved the litigation privilege as applied to claims of abuse of process by attorneys. None of the cases\ninvolved the extraordinary actions of an individual party like Epstein who carried out a course of action\nagainst Plaintiffs counsel with a singular purpose unrelated to any legitimate judicial goal. Under the\ncompelling facts of this case, where the actions of Epstein are coupled with the elements of malice and\nabsence of probable cause arising from the unfounded filing of the claims against Edwards, the litigation\nprivilege should not have any applicability to the abuse of process claim asserted by Edwards.\nThere are Disputed Issues of Fact Precluding Summary Judgment on the Abuse of Process Claim\nAn abuse of process claim requires pleading and proof of the following three elements: 1) that the\ndefendant made an illegal, improper or perverted use of process; 2) that the defendant had ulterior\nmotives or purposes in exercising such illegal, improper, or perverted use of process; and 3) that, as a\nresult of such action on the part of the defendant, the plaintiff suffered damage.\" See S&I Invs. v. Payless\nCase No.: 502009CA040800XXXXMBAG\nEdwards' Opposition to Epstein's Motion for Summary Judgment\nPage 10 of 15\nFlea Mkt., 36 So. 3d 909, 917 (Fla. 4th DCA 2010)(citation omitted). The case law is clear that on an\nabuse of process claim a \"plaintiff must prove that the process was used for an immediate purpose other\nthan that for which it was designed.\" Id. (citation omitted). Where the actions taken by a party in a\nparticular lawsuit are designed to coerce another into taking some collateral action not properly involved\nin the proceeding a claim of abuse of process is stated. Miami Herald Publishing Company v. Ferre,\n8636 F. Supp. 970 (S.D. Fla. 1985).\nIn a case for abuse of process, the question of whether the plaintiff's case satisfies the requisite\nelements is largely a question for a jury. See Patrick John McGinley, 21 Fla. Prac., Elements of an Action\n§ 50:1 (2013-2014 ed.)(citing Gatto v. Publix Supermarket, 111C. 387 So. 2d 377 (Fla. 3d DCA 1980)).\nThe usual case of abuse of process involves some form of extortion. Scozari v. Barone, 546 So.\n2d 750, 751(Fla. 3d DCA 1989) (citing Bothmann v. Harrington, 458 So. 2d 1163, 1169 (Fla. 3d DCA\n1984)). That is exactly what has transpired here. Epstein employed the extraordinary financial resources at\nhis disposal to intimidate his molestation victims and Edwards into abandoning their legitimate claims or\nresolving those claims for substantially less than their just and reasonable value. Consequently, since\nEpstein's sole purpose and ulterior motive for filing the complaint without probable cause was in an effort\nto extort, to wit: to force his molestation victims and Edwards to settle for minimal amounts, that filing\nand everything subsequently done to pursue the claims constitutes an abuse of process. See Exhs. A at 18-\n27, C at 4-7. Because Edwards has conclusively demonstrated that Epstein's actions in pursuing his\nclaims were designed to coerce Edwards (and his client) to take some collateral action not properly\ninvolved in the proceedings and did so with an ulterior purpose, summary judgment directed at the abuse\nof process claim must fail. The damages suffered by Edwards include: (a) injury to his reputation; (b)\nmental anguish, embarrassment and anxiety; (c) fear physical injury to himself and members of his\nfamily; (d) the loss of the value of his time required to be diverted from his professional responsibility;\nand (e) the cost of defending against Epstein's spurious and baseless claims. All the elements of the\nCase No.: 5 02009 CA040 8 00XXXXMB AG\nEdwards' Opposition to Epstein's Motion for Summary Judgment\nPage 11 of 15\nclaim for abuse of process have been satisfied. This case, then, falls within the parameters of the Third\nDistrict's Decision in Scozari v. Barone, supra in which the court reversed the entry of summary\njudgment for the defendant on claims of malicious prosecution and abuse of process. With respect to the\nabuse of process claim, the court stated that \"if there was no reasonable basis in law and fact to bring the\naction to impress a lien on property, and this was done without any reasonable justification under law and\nto force or compel the appellant to resolve some custody dispute, induce the appellant to pay money, or\ntie up the appellant's property, then there has been an abuse of process.\" Id at 752.\nThere are Disputed Issues of Fact Precluding Summary Judgment on the Claim of\nMalicious Prosecution\nHere, Epstein's voluntary dismissal of his abuse of process claims against Edwards amounted to a\nbona fide termination of the proceedings. He knew his allegations were unsupported by evidence (See\ndiscussion above at pages 3-6). Knowing he lacked any verifiable evidence against Edwards, on the eve\nof the summary judgment hearing, Epstein effectively conceded that fact by voluntarily dismissing his\nclaims. Hence, it is evident that Epstein took voluntary dismissal of his claims because he knew he did\nnot have probable cause or an evidentiary basis to support the allegations. See Cohen v. Corwin, 980 So.\n2d 1153 at 1156 (citing Union Oil of California, Amsco Division v. Watson, 468 So. 2d 349 at 354\n(stating that \"where a dismissal is taken because of insufficiency of the evidence, the requirement of a\nfavorable termination is met\")). Accordingly, the manner of termination reflects on the merits of the case\nand there was a bona fide termination of Epstein's civil proceeding against Edwards (See Judge Crow's\nOrder of March 29, 2012 denying Motion to Dismiss re: Issue of Bonafide Termination attached as\nExhibit \"fn.\nEpstein's only other issue with Edwards' counterclaim for malicious prosecution is that he did not\nlack probable cause in pursing his claims against Edwards. As established by the record, Epstein did, in\nfact, lack probable cause to assert his claims against Edwards (See discussion above). Epstein's purported\nCase No.: 502009CA040800XXXXMBAG\nEdwards' Opposition to Epstein's Motion for Summary Judgment\nPage 12 of 15\nreliance on public filings, including the Scherer Complaint against Rothstein is unavailing. As discussed\nabove, the evidence warrants the finding that Epstein knew that Edwards was legitimately pursuing the\nclaims on behalf of his clients which included the effort to secure testimony from Epstein's close\nconfidants. Therefore, Epstein cannot rely upon the referenced public documents to support his claims\nagainst Edwards given that he knows that information to be untrue and he refuses to answer questions\nabout the veracity of the information. See Exh. G at pgs. 53:6-24; 78:16-24; 87:20-88:14. Consequently,\nEpstein had no good faith basis to rely on such information.\nEpstein's Assertion of his Fifth Amendment Privilege Gives Rise to Adverse Inferences\nPertinent to His Motion for Summary Judgment and Precludes His Reliance on Purported\nUndisputed Facts\nAs discussed above, Epstein's multiple invocations of his Fifth Amendment Privilege results in\nadverse inferences which directly impact the issues advanced in his Motion for Summary Judgment. \"It\nis well settled that the Fifth Amendment does not forbid adverse inferences against parties to civil actions\nwhen they refuse to testify in response to probative evidence offered against them.\" Baxter v.\nPalinigiano, 425 U.S. 308, 318 (1976); Accord, Vasquez v. State, 777 So. 2d 1200, 1203 (Fla. at 2001).\nThe reason for this rule \"is both logical and utilitarian. A party may not trample upon the rights of others\nand then escape the consequences by invoking a constitutional privilege — at least not in a civil setting.\"\nFraser v. Security and INV. Corp, 615 So. 2d. 841, 842 (Fla. 4th DCA 1993). The adverse inferences\ndrawn from Epstein's assertion of the Fifth Amendment undercut his claim of justifiable reliance based\nupon the purported undisputed material facts to support his Motion for Summary Judgment.\nMoreover, because Epstein elected to hide behind the shield of his right against self-incrimination\nto preclude his disclosing any relevant information about the criminal activity at the center of his claims,\nhe was effectively barred from prosecuting his abuse of process claim against Edwards. Similarly, Epstein\nshould be barred from utilizing the Fifth Amendment privilege to secure summary judgment based upon\nassertions of fundamental facts when Epstein refused to testify on essential issues pertinent to the\nCase No.: 502009CA040800XXXXMBAG\nEdwards' Opposition to Epstein's Motion for Summary Judgment\nPage 13 of 15\narguments advanced in support of his Motion for Summary Judgment. Under the well-established \"sword\nand shield\" doctrine, Epstein could not seek damages from Edwards while at the same time asserting a\nFifth Amendment privilege to block relevant discovery. See Exhs. B at 14-21, C at 18-25, G at 53:6-24;\n78:16-24; 87:20-88:14. The same policies which underlie the sword and shield doctrine as applied to the\nrecovery of affirmative relief should also apply to attempts to advance positions with respect to a Motion\nfor Summary Judgment which would have the effect of securing relief against certain claims.\n\"[T]he law is well settled that a plaintiff is not entitled to both his silence and his lawsuit.\" Boys\n& Girls Clubs of Marion County, Inc. v. JA., 22 So. 3d 855, 856 (Fla. 5th DCA 2009)(Griffin, J.,\nconcurring specially). Thus, \"a person may not seek affirmative relief in a civil action and then invoke the\nfifth amendment to avoid giving discovery, using the fifth amendment as both a 'sword and a shield.'\"\nDePalma v. DePalma, 538 So. 2d 1290, 1290 (Fla. 4th DCA 1989)(quoting DeLisi v. Bankers Insurance\nCo., 436 So. 2d 1099 (Fla. 4th DCA 1983)). Put another way, \"[a] civil litigant's fifth amendment right to\navoid self-incrimination may be used as a shield but not a sword. This means that a plaintiff seeking\naffirmative relief in a civil action may not invoke the fifth amendment and refuse to comply with the\ndefendant's discovery requests, thereby thwarting the defendant's defenses.\" Rollins Burdick Hunter of\nNew York, Inc. v. Euroclassic Limited, Inc., 502 So. 2d 959 (Fla. 3d DCA 1983).. For the same reasons,\nEpstein should be precluded from advancing arguments based on purported statements of undisputed fact\nwhich cannot be effectively challenged in light of his assertion of the Fifth Amendment.\nEpstein has\ndone precisely what well-established law prohibits.\nConclusion\nBased upon the foregoing, the Defendant, Counter-Plaintiff, Bradley Edwards respectfully\nsubmits that Jeffrey Epstein's Motion for Summary Judgment must be denied.\nCase No.: 502009CA040800)000CMBAG\nEdwards' Opposition to Epstein's Motion for Summary Judgment\nPage 14 of 15\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that a true and correct copy of the foregoing was sent via E-Serve to all\nCounsel on the attached list, this / —7 day ofG7(>-,- , 2014.\nWILLIAM B.

EDWARDS, individually,\nDefendants,\nSTATEMENT OF UNDISPUTED FACTS\nDefendant Bradley J. Edwards, Esq., offers the following specific facts as the undisputed\nmaterial facts in this case. Each of the following facts is numbered separately and individually to\nfacilitate Epstein's required compliance with Fla. R. Civ. P. 1.510(c) (\"The adverse party shall\nidentify . . . any summary judgment evidence on which the adverse party relies.\").\nAll\nreferenced exhibits and attachments have previously been filed with the Court and provided to\nEpstein.\nSexual Abuse of Children By Epstein\n1. Defendant Epstein has a sexual preference for young children. Deposition of\nJeffrey Epstein, Mar. 17, 2010, at 110 (hereinafter \"Epstein Depo.\") (Deposition Attachment\n#1).\nI When questioned about this subject at his deposition, Epstein invoked his Fifth Amendment right to\nremain silent rather than make an incriminating admission. Accordingly, Edwards is entitled to the\nadverse inference against Epstein that, had Epstein answered, the answer would have been unfavorable to\nhim. \"Mt is well-settled that the Fifth Amendment does not forbid adverse inferences against parties to\nEXHIBIT\n2. Epstein repeatedly sexually assaulted more than forty (40) young girls on\nnumerous occasions between 2002 and 2005 in his mansion in West Palm Beach, Florida. These\nsexual assaults included vaginal penetration. Epstein abused many of the girls dozens if not\nhundreds of times.

She brought him between 20 and 30 underage females); Deposition of Jane Doe It4, date\n(hereinafter \"Jane Doe ftl Depo\") (Deposition Attachment #5) at 32-34, and 136 (she describes\nfirst being taken to Epstein at 15 years old, \"Being fingered by him, having him use a vibrator on\n[me], grabbing my nipples, smelling my butt, jerking off in front of me, licking my clit, several\ntimes.\").\n3. At all relevant times Edwards has had a good faith basis to conclude and did\nconclude' that Epstein was able to access a large number of underage girls through a pyramid\nabuse scheme in which he paid underage victims $200-$300 cash for each other underage victim\nthat she brought to him. See Palm Beach Police Incident Report at 87 (hereinafter \"Incident\nReport\") (Exhibit \"A\").3 The Palm Beach Police Incident Report details Epstein's scheme for\nmolesting underage females. Among other things, the Incident Report outlines some of the\nexperiences of other Epstein victims. When S.G, a 14 year old minor at the time, was brought to\nEpstein's home, she was taken upstairs by a woman she believed to be Epstein's assistant. The\nwoman started to fix up the room, putting covers on the massage table and bringing lotions out.\nThe \"assistant\" then left the room and told S.G. that Epstein would be up in a second. Epstein\nwalked over to S.G. and told her to take her clothes off in a stern voice. S.G. states in the report\nshe did not know what to do, as she was the only one there. S.G. took off her shirt, leaving her\nbra on. Epstein, then in a towel told her to take off everything. S.G. removed her pants leaving\n2 In support of all assertions concerning the actions Edwards took, what Edwards learned in the course of his\nrepresentation of his clients, Edwards's good faith beliefs and the foundation for those beliefs, see Edwards\nAffidavit and specifically paragraphs 25 and 25 of that Affidavit.\n3 For clarity, depositions attached to this memorandum will be identified numerically as attachments #1, #2, #3, etc.,\nwhile exhibits attached to this memorandum will be identified alphabetically as exhibits A, B, C, etc.\n3\non her thong panties. Epstein then instructed S.G to give him a massage. As S.G gave Epstein a\nmassage, Epstein turned around and masturbated. S.G. was so disgusted, she did not say\nanything; Epstein told her she \"had a really hot body.\" Id. at 14. In the report, S.G. admitted\nseeing Jeffrey Epstein's penis and stated she thought Epstein was on steroids because he was a\n\"really built guy and his wee wee was very tiny.\" Id. at 15.\n4. The exact number of minor girls who Epstein assaulted is known only to Epstein.\nHowever, Edwards had a good faith basis to believe and did in fact believe that Epstein's victims\nwere substantially more than forty (40) in number. In addition to the deposition excerpts from\ntwo of his many victims above about the number of underage girls brought to Epstein and the\nPalm Beach incident report, there is overwhelming proof that the number of underage girls\nmolested by Epstein through his scheme was in the hundreds. See Complaint, Jane Doe 102 v.\nEpstein, (hereinafter Jane Doe 102 complaint) (Exhibit \"B\"); see also Deposition of Jeffrey\nEpstein, April 14, 2010, at 442, 443, and 444 (Epstein invoking the 5th on questions about his\ndaily abuse and molestation of children) (Deposition Attachment #6).\n5. At all relevant times Edwards has had a good faith basis to believe and did in fact\nbelieve that Epstein and his attorneys knew of the seriousness of the criminal investigation\nagainst him and corresponded constantly with the United States Attorney's Office in an attempt\nto avoid the filing of numerous federal felony offenses, which effort was successful.\nSee\nCorrespondence from U.S. Attorney's Office to Epstein (hereinafter \"U.S. Attorney's\nCorrespondence\") (Composite Exhibit \"C) (provided in discovery during the Jane Doe v. Epstein\ncase).\n4\n6. At all relevant times Edwards has had a good faith basis to believe and did in fact\nbelieve that, more specifically, Epstein's attorneys knew of Epstein's scheme to recruit minors for\nsex and also knew that these minors had civil actions that they could bring against him. In fact,\nthere was much communication between Epstein's attorneys and the United States Prosecutors in\na joint attempt to minimize Epstein's civil exposure. For example, on October 3, 2007, Assistant\nU.S. Attorney Marie Villafaila sent an email (attached hereto as Exhibit \"D\") to Jay Lefkowitz,\ncounsel for Epstein, with attached proposed letter to special master regarding handling numerous\nexpected civil claims against Epstein. The letter reads in pertinent part,\n\"The undersigned, as counsel for the United States of America and\nJeffrey Epstein, jointly write to you to provide information relevant to your\nservice as a Special Master in the selection of an attorney to represent several\nyoung women who may have civil damages claims against Mr. Epstein. The\nU.S. Attorney's Office and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (jointly referred\nto as the \"United States\") have conducted an investigation of Jeffrey Epstein\nregarding his solicitation of minor females in Palm Beach County to engage in\nprostitution. Mr. Epstein, through his assistants, would recruit underage\nfemales to travel to his home in Palm Beach to engage in lewd conduct in\nexchange for money. Based upon the investigation, the United States has\nidentified forty (40) young women who can be characterized as victims\npursuant to 18 USC 2255. Some of those women went to Mr. Epstein's home\nonly once, some went there as much as 100 times or more. Some of the\nwomen's conduct was limited to performing a topless or nude massage while\nMr. Epstein-masturbated himself For other women, the conduct escalated to\nfull sexual intercourse. As part of the resolution of the case, Epstein has\nagreed that he would not contest jurisdiction in the Southern District of Florida\nfor any victim who chose to sue him for damages pursuant to 18 USC 2255.\nMr. Epstein agreed to provide an attorney for victims who elected to proceed\nexclusively pursuant to that section, and agreed to waive any challenge to\nliability under that section up to an amount agreed to by the parties. The parties\nhave agreed to submit the selection of an attorney to a Special Master....\"\n7. At all relevant times Edwards has had a good faith basis to believe and did in fact\nbelieve that L.M. was, in fact, a victim of Epstein's criminal abuse because L.M. was one of the\n5\nminor females that the United States Attorney's Office recognized as a victim. L.M.'s sworn\ndeposition testimony and the adverse inference drawn from Epstein's refusal to testify confirm\nthat Epstein began sexually assaulting L.M. when she was 13 years old and continued to molest\nher on more than fifty (50) occasions over three (3) years. Epstein Depo., Attachment #1, at 17\n(\"Q: Did you . . . ever engage in any sexual conduct with L.M.?\" A: [Invocation of the Fifth\nAmendment].); see also Epstein Depo., April 14, 2010, Attachment #6, at 456 (\"Q: LM was an\nunderage female that you first abused when she was 13 years old; is that correct?\" A: [Invocation\nof Fifth Amendment].)\n8. Epstein was also given ample opportunity to explain why he engaged in sexual\nactivity with L.M. beginning when L.M. was 13 years old and why he has molested minors on an\neveryday basis for years, and he invoked his 5th amendment right rather than provide\nexplanation.\nSee Epstein Deposition, February 17, 2010, at 11-12, 30-31 (Deposition\nAttachment # 7).\n9. Epstein also sexually assaulted E.W., beginning when she was 14 years old and\ndid so on numerous occasions. See E.W. Depo., Attachment #1 at 215-216.\n10. Another of the minor girls Epstein sexually assaulted was Jane Doe; the abuse\nbegan when Jane Doe was 14 years old. Rather than incriminate himself, Epstein invoked the\n5th amendment to questions about him digitally penetrating Doe's vagina, using vibrators on her\nvagina and masturbating and ejaculating in her presence. Epstein Depo., April 14, 2010,\nAttachment #6, at 420, 464, 468.\n11. When Edwards's clients L.M., E.W., and Jane Doe were 13 or 14 years old, each\nwas brought to Epstein's home multiple times by another underage victim. Epstein engaged in\n6\none or more of the following acts with each of the then-minor girls at his mansion: receiving a\ntopless or completely nude massage; using a vibrator on her vagina; masturbating in her\npresence; ejaculating in her presence; touching her breast or buttocks or vagina or the clothes\ncovering her sexual organs; and demanding that she bring him other underage girls. Epstein and\nhis co-conspirators used the telephone to contact these girls to entice or induce them into going\nto his mansion for sexual abuse. Epstein also made E.W. perform oral sex on him and was to\nperform sex acts on Nadia Marcinkova (Epstein's live-in sex slave) in Epstein's presence. See\nPlaintiff Jane Doe's Notice Regarding Evidence of Similar Acts of Sexual Assault, filed in Jane\nDoe v. Epstein, No. 08-cv-80893 (S.D. Fla. 2010), as DE 197, (hereinafter \"Rule 413 Notice)\n(Exhibit \"F'); Jane Doe Depo., Attachment #2, at 379-380; L.M. Depo., Attachment #3, at 416;\nE.W. Depo, Attachment #4, at 205.\n12. At all relevant times Edwards has had a good faith basis to believe and did in fact\nbelieve that yet another of the minor girls Epstein sexually assaulted was C.L. When she was\napproximately 15 years old, C.L. was brought to Epstein's home by another underage victim.\nWhile a minor, she was at Epstein's home on multiple occasions. Epstein engaged in one or\nmore of the following acts with her while she was a minor at his house - topless or completely\nnude massage on Epstein; Epstein used a vibrator on her vagina; Epstein masturbated in her\npresence; Epstein ejaculated in her presence; Epstein also demanded that she bring him other\nunderage girls. See Rule 413 Notice, Exhibit \"E\"; Incident Report, Exhibit \"A.\"\n13. At all relevant times Edwards has had a good faith basis to believe and did in fact\nbelieve that yet another girl Epstein sexually assault was A.H. When she was approximately 16\nyears old, she was brought to Epstein's home by another underage victim. While a minor, she\n7\nwas at Epstein's home on multiple occasions. Epstein engaged in one or more of the following\nacts with her while she was a minor at his house - topless or completely nude massage on\nEpstein; Epstein used a vibrator on her vagina; Epstein masturbated in her presence; Epstein\nejaculated in her presence; Epstein touched her breast or buttock or vagina or the clothes\ncovering her sexual organs; was made to perform sex acts on Epstein; made to perfoini sex acts\non Nadia Marcinkova in Epstein's presence. Epstein also forcibly raped this underage victim, as\nhe held her head down against her will and pumped his penis inside her while she was screaming\n\"No\". See Rule 413 Notice, Exhibit \"E\"; Incident Report, Exhibit \"A\", at 41 (specifically\ndiscussing the rape):\n\"[A.H.] remembered that she climaxed and was removing herself from the\nmassage table. [A.H.] asked for a sheet of paper and drew the massage table in the\nmaster bathroom and where Epstein, Marcinkova and she were. Epstein turned\n[A.H.] on to her stomach on the massage bed and inserted his penis into her\nvagina. [A.H.] stated Epstein began to pump his penis in her vagina. [A.H.]\nbecame upset over this. She said her head was being held against the bed forcibly,\nas he continued to pump inside her. She screamed no, and Epstein stopped ....\"\n\"[A.H.] advised there were times that she was so sore when she left Epstein's\nhouse. [A.H.] advised she was ripped, torn, in her vagina area. [A.H.] advised she\nhad difficulty walking to the car after leaving the house because she was so sore.\"\n14. Without detailing each fact known about Epstein's abuse of the many underage\ngirls, Edwards has had a good faith basis to believe and did in fact believe at all relevant times\nthat Epstein also abused other victims in ways closely similar to those described in the preceding\nparagraphs. Epstein's additional victims include the following (among many other) young girls:\nS.G.; A.D.; V.A.; N.R.; J.S.; V.Z.; J.A.; F.E.; M.L.; M.D.; D.D.; and D.N. These girls were\nbetween the ages of 13 and 17 when Epstein abused them. See Rule 413 Notice, Exhibit E;\nDeposition of E.W., Deposition Attachment /Pl.\n8\n15. One of Mr. Epstein's household employees, Mr. Alfredo Rodriguez, saw\nnumerous underage girls coming into Epstein's mansion for purported \"massages.\"\nSee\nRodriguez Depo. at 242-44 (Deposition Attachment #8). Rodriguez was aware that \"sex toys\"\nand vibrators were found in Epstein's bedroom after the purported massages. Id. at 223-28.\nRodriguez thought what Epstein was doing was wrong, given the extreme youth of the girls he\nsaw. Id. at 230-31..\n16. Alfredo Rodriguez took a journal from Epstein's computer that reflected many of\nthe names of underage females Epstein abused across the country and the world, including\nlocations such as Michigan, California, West Palm Beach, New York, New Mexico, and Paris,\nFrance. See Journal (hereinafter \"The Journal\" or \"Holy Grail\") (Exhibit \"F\") (identifying,\namong other Epstein acquaintances, females that Rodriguez believes were underage under the\nheading labeled \"Massages\").\n17. Rodriguez was later charged in a criminal complaint with obstruction of justice in\nconnection with trying to obtain $50,000 from civil attorneys pursuing civil sexual assault cases\nagainst Epstein as payment for producing the book to the attorneys. See Criminal Complaint at\n2, U.S. v. Rodriguez, No. 9:10-CR-80015-KAM (S.D. Fla. 2010) (Exhibit \"G\"). Rodriguez\nstated he needed money because the journal was his \"property\" and that he was afraid that\nJeffrey Epstein would make him \"disappear\" unless he had an \"insurance policy\" (i.e., the\njournal). Id. at 3. Because of the importance of the information in the journal to the civil cases,\nMr. Rodriguez called it \"The Holy Grail.\"\n18. In the \"Holy Grail\" or \"The Journal,\" among the many names listed (along with\nthe abused girls) are some of the people that Epstein alleges in his Complaint had \"no connection\n9\nwhatsoever\" with the litigation in this case. See, e.g., Journal, Exhibit F, at 85 (Donald Trump);\nat 9 (Bill Clinton phone numbers listed under \"Doug Bands\").\nFederal Investigation and Plea Agreement With Epstein\n19. In approximately 2005, the FBI and the U.S. Attorney's Office in the Southern\nDistrict of Florida learned of Epstein's repeated sexual abuse of minor girls. They began a\ncriminal investigation into federal offenses related to his crimes.\nSee U.S. Attorney's\nCorrespondence, Exhibit C.\n20. At all relevant times Edwards has had a good faith basis to believe and did in fact\nbelieve that to avoid the Government learning about his abuse of minor girls, Epstein threatened\nhis employees and demanded that they not cooperate with the government. Epstein's aggressive\nwitness tampering was so severe that the United States Attorney's Office prepared negotiated\nplea agreements containing these charges. For example, in a September 18, 2007, email from\nAUSA Villafafia to Lefkowitz (attached hereto as Exhibit \"I-F), she attached the proposed plea\nagreement describing Epstein's witness tampering as follows:\n\"UNITED STATES vs. JEFFREY EPSTEIN PLEA PROFFER\"\nOn August 21, 2007, FBI Special Agents E. Nesbitt Kuyrkendall and Jason\nRichards traveled to the home of Leslie Groff to serve her with a federal grand\njury subpoena with an investigation pending in the Southern District of Florida.\nMs. Groff works as the personal assistant of the defendant. Ms. Groff began\nspeaking with the agents and then excused herself to go upstairs to check on her\nsleeping child. While upstairs, Ms. Groff telephoned the defendant, Jeffrey\nEpstein, and informed him that the FBI agents were at her home. Mr. Epstein\ninstructed Ms. Groff not to speak with the agents and reprimanded her for\nallowing them into her home. Mr. Epstein applied pressure to keep Ms. Groff\nfrom complying with the grand jury subpoenas that the agents had served upon\nher. In particular, Mr. Epstein warned Ms. Groff against turning over documents\nand electronic evidence responsive to the subpoena and pressured her to delay her\n10\nappearance before the grand jury in the Southern District of Florida. This\nconversation occurred when Mr. Epstein was aboard his privately owned civilian\naircraft in Miami in the Southern District of Florida. His pilot had filed a flight\nplan showing the parties were about to return to Teterboro, NJ. After the\nconversation with Ms. Groff, Mr. Epstein became concerned that the FBI would\ntry to serve his traveling companion, Nadia Marcinkova, with a similar grand jury\nsubpoena. In fact, the agents were preparing to serve Ms. Marcinkova with a\ntarget letter when the flight landed in Teterboro. Mr. Epstein then redirected his\nairplane, making the pilot file a new flight plan to travel to the US Virgin Islands\ninstead of the New York City area, thereby keeping the Special Agents from\nserving the target letter on Nadia Marcinkova. During the flight, the defendant\nverbally harassed Ms. Marcinkova, harassing and pressuring her not to cooperate\nwith the grand jury's investigation, thereby hindering and dissuading her from\nreporting the commission of a violation of federal law to a law enforcement\nofficer, namely, Special Agents of the FBI. Epstein also threatened and harassed\nSarah Kellen against cooperating against him as well.\n21. Edwards learned that the Palm Beach police depaitment investigation ultimately\nled to the execution of a search warrant at Epstein's mansion in October 2005. See Police\nIncident Report, Exhibit A.\n22. Edwards learned that at around the same time, the Palm Beach Police Depai inent\nalso began investigating Epstein's sexual abuse of minor girls. They also collected evidence of\nEpstein's involvement with minor girls and his obsession with training sex slaves, including\npulling information' from Epstein's trash. Their investigation showed that Epstein ordered from\nArnazon.com on about September 4, 2005, such books as: SM101: A Realistic Introduction, by\nJay Wiseman; SlaveCraft: Roadmaps for Erotic Servitude - Principles, Skills, and Tools, by Guy\nBaldwin; and Training with Miss Abernathy: A Workbook for Erotic Slaves and Their Owners,\nby Christina Abernathy. See Receipt for Sex Slave Books (Exhibit \"r).\n23. The Palm Beach incident reports provided Edwards with the names of numerous\nwitnesses that participated in Epstein's child molestation criminal enterprise and also provided\n11\nEdwards with some insight into how far-reaching Epstein's power was and how addicted Epstein\nwas to sex with children. See Incident Report, Exhibit A.\n24. The Palm Beach Police Depai talent also collected Epstein's message pads, which\nprovided other names of people that also knew Epstein's scheme to molest children. See\nMessage Pads (Exhibit \"J\") (note: the names of underage females have been redacted to protect\nthe anonymity of the underage sex abuse victims). Those message pads show clear indication\nthat Epstein's staff was frequently working to schedule multiple young girls between the ages of\n12 and 16 years old literally every day, often two or three times per day. Id.\n25. In light of all of the information of numerous crimes committed by Epstein,\nEdwards learned that the U.S. Attorney's Office began preparing the filing of federal criminal\ncharges against Epstein.\nFor example, in addition to the witness tampering and money\nlaundering charges the U.S. Attorney's Office prepared an 82-page prosecution memo and a 53-\npage indictment of Epstein related to his sexual abuse of children. On September 19, 2007, at\n12:14 PM, AUSA Villafacia wrote to Epstein's counsel, Jay Lefkowitz, \"Jay - I hate to have to be\nfirm about this, but we need to wrap this up by Monday. I will not miss my indictment date\nwhen this has dragged on for several weeks already and then, if things fall apart, be left in a less\nadvantageous position than before the negotiations. I have had an 82-page pros memo and 53-\npage indictment sitting on the shelf since May to engage in these negotiations. There has to be\nan ending date, and that date is Monday.\" These and other communications are within the\ncorrespondence attached as Composite Exhibit \"C.\"\n26. Edwards learned that rather than face the filing of federal felony criminal charges,\nEpstein (through his attorneys) engaged in plea bargain discussions.\n12\nAs a result of those\ndiscussions, on September 24, 2007, Epstein signed an agreement with the U.S. Attorney's\nOffice for the Southern District of Florida. Under the agreement, Epstein agreed to plead guilty\nto an indictment pending against him in the 15th Judicial Circuit in and for Palm Beach County\ncharging him with. solicitation of prostitution and procurement of minors for prostitution.\nEpstein also agreed that he would receive a thirty month sentence, including 18 months of jail\ntime and 12 months of community control. In exchange, the U.S. Attorney's Office agreed not to\npursue any federal charges against Epstein. See Non-Prosecution Agreement (Exhibit \"K\").\n27. Part of the Non-Prosecution Agreement that Epstein negotiated was a provision in\nwhich the federal government agreed not to prosecute Epstein's co-conspirators.\nThe coconspirators\nprocured minor females to be molested by Epstein. One of the co-conspirators -\nNadia Marcinkova -even participated in the sex acts with minors (including E.W.) and Epstein.\nSee Incident Report, Exhibit \"A\", at 40-42, 49-51; Deposition of Nadia Marcinkova, April 13,\n2010, (hereinafter \"Marcinkova Depo.\") at 11 (Deposition attachment #9).\n28. Under the Non-Prosecution Agreement, Epstein was to use his \"best efforts\" to\nenter into his guilty pleas by October 26, 2007. However, Edwards learned that Epstein violated\nhis agreement with the U.S. Attorney's Office to do so and delayed entry of his plea. See Letter\nfrom U.S. Attorney R. Alexander Acosta to Lilly Ann Sanchez, Dec. 19, 2007 (Exhibit \"L\").\n29. On January 10, 2008 and again on May 30, 2008 E.W. and L.M. received letters\nfrom the FBI advising them that \"Nhis case is currently under investigation. This can be a\nlengthy process and we request your continued patience while we conduct a thorough\ninvestigation.\" Letters attached at Composite Exhibit M. This document is evidence that the\nFBI did not notify E.W. and L.M. that a plea agreement had already been reached that would\n13\nblock federal prosecution of Epstein. Nor did the FBI notify E.W. and L.M. of any of the parts of\nthe plea agreement. Nor did the FBI or other federal authorities confer with E.W. and L.M.\nabout the plea. See id.\n30. In 2008, Edwards believed in good faith that criminal prosecution of Epstein was\nextremely important to his clients E.W. and L.M. and that they desired to be consulted by the\nFBI and/or other representatives of the federal government about the prosecution of Epstein.\nThe letters that they had received around January 10, 2008, suggested that a criminal\ninvestigation of Epstein was on-going and that they would be contacted before the federal\ngovernment reached any final resolution of that investigation. See id.\nEdwards Agrees to Serve as Legal Counsel for Three Victims of Epstein's Sexual\nAssaults\n31. In about April 2008, Bradley J. Edwards, Esq., was a licensed attorney in Florida,\npracticing as a sole practitioner. As a former prosecutor, he was well versed in civil cases that\ninvolved criminal acts, including sexual assaults. Three of the many girls Epstein had abused —\nL.M., E.W., and Jane Doe — all requested that Edwards represent them civilly and secure\nappropriate monetary damages against Epstein for repeated acts of sexual abuse while they were\nminor girls. Two of the girls (L.M. and E.W.) also requested that Edwards represent them in\nconnection with a concern that the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and U.S. Attorney's\nOffice might be arranging a plea bargain for the criminal offenses committed by Epstein without\nproviding them the legal rights to which they were entitled (including the right to be notified of\nplea discussions and the right to confer with prosecutors about any plea arrangement).\nSee\n14\nAffidavit of Bradley. J. Edwards, Esq. at ¶1 - 2, ¶4 (hereinafter \"Edwards Affidavit\") (Exhibit\nN\").\n32. On June 13, 2008, attorney Edwards agreed to represent E.W.; on July 2, 2008,\nattorney Edwards agreed to represent Jane Doe; and, on July 7, 2008, attorney Edwards agreed to\nrepresent L.M. in connection with the sexual assaults committed by Epstein and to insure that\ntheir rights as victims of crimes were protected in the criminal process on-going against Epstein.\nMr. Edwards and his three clients executed written retention agreements. See id. at ¶2.\n33. In mid June of 2008, Edwards contacted AUSA Villafafia to infoun her that he\nrepresented Jane Doe #1 and, later, Jane Doe #2. AUSA Villafatia did not advise that a plea\nagreement had already been negotiated with Epstein's attorneys that would block federal\nprosecution. To the contrary, AUSA Villafana mentioned a possible indictment. AUSA\nVillafafia did indicate that federal investigators had concrete evidence and information that\nEpstein had sexually molested many underage minor females, including E.W., LM, and Jane\nDoe. See id. at ¶4.\n34. Edwards also requested from the U.S. Attorney's Office the information that they\nhad collected regarding Epstein's sexual abuse of his clients. However, the U.S. Attorney's\nOffice, declined to provide any such information to Edwards. It similarly declined to provide\nany such information to the other attorneys who represented victims of Epstein's sexual assaults.\nAt the very least, this includes the items that were confiscated in the search warrant of Epstein's\nhome, including dildos, vibrators, massage table, oils, and additional message pads.\nSee\nProperty Receipt (Exhibit \"0\").\n15\n35. On Friday, June 27, 2008, at approximately 4:15 p.m., AUSA Villafafia received a\ncopy of Epstein's proposed state plea agreement and learned that the plea was scheduled for 8:30\na.m., Monday, June 30, 2008. AUSA Villafafia called Edwards to provide notice to his clients\nregarding the hearing. AUSA Villafafia did not tell Attorney Edwards that the guilty pleas in\nstate court would bring an end to the possibility of federal prosecution pursuant to the plea\nagreement. See Edwards Affidavit, Exhibit \"N\", at ¶6.\n36. Under the Crime Victims' Rights Act (CVRA), 18 U.S.C. § 3771, victims of\nfederal crimes — including E.W. and L.M. — are entitled to basic rights during any plea\nbargaining process; including the right to be treated with fairness, the right to confer with\nprosecutors regarding any plea, and the right to be heard regarding any plea. The process that\nwas followed leading to the non-prosecution of Epstein violated these rights of E.W. and L.M.\nSee Emergency Petn. for Victim's Enforcement of Crime Victim's Rights, No. 9:08-CV-80736-\nKAM (S.D. Fla. 2008) (Exhibit \"P\").\n37. Because of the violation of the CVRA, on July 7, 2008, Edwards filed an action in\nthe U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida, Case No. 9:08-CV-80736, seeking to\nenforce the rights of E.W. and L.M. That action alleged that the U.S. Attorney's Office had\nfailed to provide E.W. and L.M. the rights to which they were entitled under the Act, including\nthe right to be notified about a plea agreement and to confer with prosecutors regarding it. See\nid.\n38. On July 11, 2008, Edwards took E.W. and L.M. with him to the hearing on the\nCVRA action. It was only at this hearing that both victims learned for the first time that the plea\ndeal was already done with Epstein and that the criminal case against Epstein had been\n16\neffectively terminated by the U.S. Attorney's office. See Hearing Transcript, July 11, 2008\n(Exhibit \"Q\").\n39. Edwards learned that Jane Doe felt so strongly that the plea bargain was\ninappropriate that she made her own determination to appear on a television program and\nexercise her First Amendment rights to criticize the unduly lenient plea bargain Epstein received\nin a criminal case.\n40. The CVRA action that Edwards filed was recently administratively closed and\nEdwards filed a Motion to reopen that proceeding. See No. 9:08-CV-80736 (S.D. Fla.).\nEpstein's Entry of Guilty Pleas to Sex Offenses\n41. Ultimately, on June 30, 2008, in the Fifteenth Judicial Circuit in Palm Beach\nCounty, Florida, defendant Epstein, entered pleas of \"guilty\" to various Florida state crimes\ninvolving the solicitation of minors for prostitution and the procurement of minors for the\npurposes of prostitution. See Plea Colloquy (Exhibit \"R\").\n42. As a condition of that plea, and in exchange for the Federal Government not\nprosecuting the Defendant, Epstein additionally entered into an agreement with the Federal\nGovernment acknowledging that approximately thirty-four (34) other young girls could receive\npayments from him under the federal statute providing for compensation to victims of child\nsexual abuse, 18 U.S.C. § 2255. As had been agreed months before, the U.S. Attorney's Office\ndid not prosecute Epstein federally for his sexual abuse of these minor girls. See Addendum to\nNon-Prosecution Agreement (Exhibit \"S\") (in redacted fowl to protect the identities of the\nminors involved).\n17\n43. Because Epstein became a convicted sex offender, he was not to have contact\nwith any of his victims. During the course of his guilty pleas on June 30, 2008, Palm Beach\nCircuit Court Judge Deborah Dale Pucillo ordered Epstein \"not to have any contact, direct or\nindirect\" with any victims. She also expressly stated that her no-contact order applied to \"all of\nthe victims.\"\nSimilar orders were entered by the federal court handling some of the civil cases\nagainst Epstein. The federal court stated that it \"finds it necessary to state clearly that Defendant\nis under this court's order not to have direct or indirect contact with any plaintiffs . . . .\" Order,\nCase No. 9:08-cv-80119 (S.D. Fla. 2008), [DE 238] at 4-5 (emphasis added); see also Order,\nCase No. 9:08-cv-80893, [DE 193] at 2 (emphasis added).\nEdwards Files Civil Suits Against Epstein\n44. Edwards had a good faith belief that his clients felt angry and betrayed by the\ncriminal system and wished to prosecute and punish Epstein for his crimes against them in\nwhatever avenue remained open to them. On August 12, 2008, at the request of his client Jane\nDoe, Brad Edwards filed a civil suit against Jeffrey Epstein to recover damages for his sexual\nassault of Jane Doe. See Edwards Affidavit, \"N\" at $7. Included in this complaint was a RICO\ncount that explained how Epstein ran a criminal conspiracy to procure young girls for him to\nsexually abuse. See Complaint, Jane Doe v. Epstein (Exhibit \"T\").\n45. On September 11, 2008, at the request of his client E.W., Brad Edwards filed a civil\nsuit against Jeffrey Epstein to recover damages for his sexual assault of E.W. See Complaint,\nE.W. v. Epstein (Exhibit \"U\").\n18\n46. On September 11, 2008, at the request of his client L.M.., Brad Edwards filed a civil\nsuit against Jeffiey.Epstein to recover damages for his sexual assault of L.M. See Complaint,\nL.M. v. Epstein, (Exhibit \"V\").\n47. Jane Doe's federal complaint indicated that she sought damages of more than\n$50,000,000. Listing the amount of damages sought in the complaint was in accord with other\ncivil suits that were. filed against Epstein (before any lawsuit filed by Edwards). See Complaint,\nJane Doe itd v. Epstein (Exhibit \"W\") (filed by Herman and Meimelstein, PA).\n48. At about the same time as Edwards filed his three lawsuits against Epstein, other\ncivil attorneys were filing similar lawsuits against Epstein. For example, on or about April 14,\n2008 another law firm, Herman and Mermelstein, filed the first civil action against Epstein on\nbehalf of one of its seven clients who were molested by Epstein. The complaints that attorney\nHerman filed on behalf of his seven clients were similar in tenor and tone to the complaint that\nEdwards filed on behalf of his three clients. See id.\n49. Over the next year and a half, more than 20 other similar civil actions were filed by\nvarious attorneys against Epstein alleging sexual assault of minor girls. These complaints were\nalso similar in tenor and tone to the complaint that Edwards filed on behalf of his clients. These\ncomplaints are all public record and have not been attached, but are available in this Court's files\nand the files of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida.\n50. In addition to the complaints filed against Epstein in Florida, a female in New York,\nAva Cordero, filed a lawsuit against Epstein in New York making similar allegations - that\nEpstein paid her for a massage then forced her to give him oral sex and molested her in other\nways when she was only 16 years old. Cordero was bom a male, and in her complaint she\n19\nalleges that Epstein told her during the \"massage\", \"I love how young you are. You have a tight\nbutt like a baby\". See Jeff Epstein Sued for \"Repeated Sexual Assaults\" on Teen, New York\nPost, October 17, 2007, by Dareh Gregorian, link at:\nhttp://www.nypost.com/p/news/regional/item 44z1WyLUFH7R1OUtKYGPbP;j se s si oni d=6CA3\nEB FlBEF 68F5DE14BFB2 GAAS C37E0. See Article attached hereto as Exhibit X.\n51. Edwards's three complaints against Epstein contained less detail about sexual\nabuse than (as one example) a complaint filed by attorney Robert Josephsberg from the law fiiui\nof Podhurst Orseck. See Complaint, Jane Doe 102 v. Epstein (Exhibit \"B\"). As recounted in\ndetail in this Complaint, Jane Doe 102 was 15 years old when Ghislaine Maxwell discovered her\nand lured her to Epstein's house. Maxwell and Epstein forced her to have sex with both of them\nand within weeks Maxwell and Epstein were flying her all over the world. According to the\nComplaint, Jane Doe 102 was forced to live as one of Epstein's underage sex slaves for years\nand was forced to have sex with not only Maxwell and Epstein but also other politicians,\nbusinessmen, royalty, academicians, etc. She was even made to watch Epstein have sex with\nthree 12-year-old French girls that were sent to him for his birthday by A French citizen that is a\nfriend of Epstein's. Luckily, Jane Doe 102 escaped to Australia to get away from Epstein and\nMaxwell's sexual abuse.\n52. Edwards learned that in addition to civil suits that were filed in court against\nEpstein, at around the same time other attorneys engaged in pre-filing settlement discussions\nwith Epstein. Rather than face filed civil suits in these cases, Epstein paid money settlements to\nmore than 15 other women who had sexually abused while they were minors. See articles\nregarding settlements attached hereto as Composite Exhibit \"Y.\"\n20\nEpstein's Obstruction of Normal Discovery and Attacks on His Victims\n53. Once Edwards filed his civil complaints for his three clients, he began the normal\nprocess of discovery for cases such as these. He sent standard discovery requests to Epstein\nabout his sexual abuse of the minor girls, including requests for admissions, request for\nproduction, and interrogatories. See Edwards Affidavit, Exhibit `1\\T\", at 11111-19 and 25.\nRather than answer any substantive questions about his sexual abuse and his conspiracy for\nprocuring minor girls for him to abuse, Epstein invoked his 5th amendment right against selfincrimination.\nAn example of Epstein's refusal to answer is attached as Composite Exhibit \"Z\"\n(original discovery propounded to Epstein and his responses invoking 5th amendment).\n54. During the discovery phase of the civil cases filed against Epstein, Epstein's\ndeposition was taken at least five times. During all of those depositions, Epstein refused to\nanswer any substantive questions about his sexual abuse of minor girls. See, e.g., Deposition\nAttachments 1, 6 and 7.\n55. During these depositions, Epstein further attempted to obstruct legitimate\nquestioning by inserting a variety of irrelevant information about his case.\nAs one of\ninnumerable examples, on March 8, 2010, Mr. Horowitz, representing seven victims, Jane Doe's\n2-8, asked, \"Q: In 2004, did you rub Jane Doe 3's vagina? A: Excuse me. I'd like to answer that\nquestion, as I would like to answer mostly every question you've asked me here today; however,\nupon advice of counsel, I cannot answer that question. They've advised me I must assert my\nSixth Amendment, Fifth Amendment and Fourteenth Amendment Rights against self--excuse\nme, against--under the Constitution. And though your partner, Jeffiey Heiman, was disbarred\nafter filing this lawsuit [a statement that was untrue], Mr. Edwards' pai tier sits in jail for\n21\nfabricating cases of a sexual nature fleecing unsuspecting Florida investors and others out of\nmillions of dollars for cases of a sexual nature with--I'd like to answer your questions; however if\nI--I'm told that if I do so, I risk losing my counsel's representation; therefore I must accept their\nadvice.\" Epstein deposition, March 8, 2010, at 106 (Deposition attachment #10).\n56. When Edwards had the opportunity to take Epstein's deposition, he only asked\nreasonable questions, all of which related to the merits of the cases against Epstein.\nA11\ndepositions of Epstein in which Mr. Edwards participated on behalf of his clients are attached to\nthis motion. See Edwards Affidavit, Exhibit \"N\" at Il 1 and Deposition attachments #1, 6, 7, 10,\n11, 12, and 13. Cf. with Deposition of Epstein taken by an attorney representing BB (one in\nwhich Edwards was not participating), http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-dqoEyYXx4; and\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YCNiY1tW-r0\n57. Edwards's efforts to obtain information about Epstein's organization for\nprocuring young girls was also blocked because Epstein's co-conspirators took the Fifth.\nDeposition of Sarah Kellen, March 24, 2010 (hereinafter \"Kellen Depo.\") (Deposition\nattachment #14); Deposition of Nadia Marcinkova, April 13, 2010, (Deposition attachment #9);\nDeposition of Adriana Mucinska Ross, March 15, 2010 (hereinafter \"Ross Depo.\") (Deposition\nattachment #15). Each of these co-conspirators invoked their respective rights against selfincrimination\nas to all relevant questions, and the depositions have been attached.\n58. At all relevant times Edwards has had a good faith basis to believe and did in fact\nbelieve Sarah Kellen was an employee of Epstein's and had been identified as a defendant in at\nleast one of the complaints against Epstein for her role in bringing girls to Epstein's mansion to\nbe abused. At the deposition, she was represented by Bruce Reinhart. She invoked the Fifth on\n22\nall substantive questions regarding her role in arranging for minor girls to come to Epstein's\nmansion to be sexually abused.\nReinhart had previously been an Assistant United States\nAttorney in the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of Florida when Epstein was\nbeing investigated criminally by Reinhart's office. Reinhart left the United States Attorney's\nOffice and was immediately hired by Epstein to represent Epstein's pilots and certain coconspirators\nduring the civil cases against Epstein. See Edwards Affidavit, Exhibit `1\\1\" at ¶11.\n59. Edwards also had other lines of legitimate discovery blocked through the efforts\nof Epstein and others. For example, Edwards learned through deposition that Ghislaine Maxwell\nwas involved in managing Epstein's affairs and companies. See deposition of Epstein's house\nmanager Janusz Banziak, February 16, 2010 at page 14, lines 20-23 (Deposition Attachment\n#16); See deposition of Epstein's housekeeper Louella Rabuyo, October 20, 2009, page 9, lines\n17-25 (Deposition Attachment #17); See deposition of Epstein's pilot Larry Eugene Morrison,\nOctober 6, 2009, page 102-103 (Deposition Attachment #18); See deposition of Alfredo\nRodriguez, August 7, 2009, page 302-306 and 348 (Deposition Attachment #8); See also Prince\nAndrew's Friend, Ghislaine Maxwell, Some Underage Girls and A Very Disturbing Story,\nSeptember 23, 2007 by Wendy Leigh, link at\nhap://www.redicecreations.com/article.php?id=18950HANNA SJOBERG. Exhibit \"AA\".\n60. Alfredo Rodriguez testified that Maxwell took photos of girls without the girls'\nknowledge, kept the images on her computer, knew the names of the underage girls and their\nrespective phone numbers and other underage victims were molested by Epstein and Maxwell\ntogether. See Deposition of Rodriguez, Deposition attachment # 8 at 64, 169-170 and 236.\n23\n61. In reasonable reliance on this and other information, Edwards served Maxwell for\ndeposition in 2009. See Deposition Notice attached as Exhibit \"BB.\" Maxwell was represented\nby Brett Jaffe of the New York film of Cohen and Gresser, and Edwards understood that her\nattorney was paid for (directly or indirectly) by Epstein.\nShe was reluctant to give her\ndeposition, and Edwards tried to work with her attorney to take her deposition on terms that\nwould be acceptable to both sides. The result was the attached confidentiality agreement, under\nwhich Maxwell agreed to drop any objections to the deposition, attached hereto as Exhibit \"CC.\"\nMaxwell, however, contrived to avoid the deposition.\nOn June 29, 2010, one day before\nEdwards was to fly to NY to take Maxwell's deposition, her attorney informed Edwards that\nMaxwell's mother was deathly ill and Maxwell was consequently flying to England with no\nintention of returning to the United States. Despite that assertion, Ghislaine Maxwell was in fact\nin the country on July 31, 2010, as she attended the wedding of Chelsea Clinton (former\nPresident Clinton's daughter) and was captured in a photograph taken for OK magazine. Photos\nfrom Issue 809 of the publication See US Weekly dated August 16, 2010 are attached hereto as\nExhibit \"DD\" and Edwards Affidavit, Exhibit \"N\" at ¶12.\n62. Maxwell is not the only important witness to lie to avoid deposition by Edwards.\nUpon review of the.message pads that were taken from Epstein's home in the police trash pulls,\nsee. Exhibit \"Y' supra, many were from Jean Luc Brunel, a French citizen and one of Epstein's\nclosest pals. He left messages for Epstein. One dated 4/1/05 said, \"He has a teacher for you to\nteach you how to speak Russian. She is 2x8 years old, not blonde. Lessons are free and you can\nhave your lst today if you call.\" See Messages taken from Jean Luc Brunel are attached hereto as\nExhibit \"EE.\" In light of these circumstances of the case, this message reasonably suggested to\n24\nEdwards that Brunel might have been procuring two eight-year-old girls for Epstein to sexually\nabuse.\nAccording .to widely circulated press reports reviewed by Edwards, Brunel is in his\nsixties and has a reputation throughout the world (and especially in the modeling industry) as a\ncocaine addict that has for years molested children through modeling agencies while acting as\ntheir agent — conduct that has been the subject of critical reports, books, several news articles,\nand a 60 Minutes documentary on Brunel's sexual exploitation of underage models.\nSee\nhttp://bradmillershero.blogspot.com/2010/08/women-are-objects.html, attached hereto as Exhibit\n\"FF.\"\n63. Edwards learned that Brunel is also someone that visited Epstein on\napproximately 67 occasions while Epstein was in jail. See Epstein's jail visitor log attached as\nExhibit \"GG.\"\n64. Edwards learned that Brunel currently runs the modeling agency MC2, a company\nfor which Epstein provides financial support. See Message Pad's attached as Exhibit \"T' supra\nand Sworn Statement of MC2 employee Maritza Vasquez, June 15, 2010, \"Maritza Vasquez\nSworn Statement\" attached at Exhibit \"RH\" at 1-16.\n65. Employees of MC2 told Edwards that Epstein's numerous condos at 301 East 66\nStreet in New York were used to house young models. Edwards was told that MC2 modeling\nagency, affiliated with Epstein and Brunel brought underage girls from all over the world,\npromising them modeling contracts. Epstein and Brunel would then obtain a visa for these girls,\nthen would charge the underage girls rent, presumably to live as underage prostitutes in the\ncondos. See Maritza Vasquez Sworn Statement, Exhibit \"HH\" at 7-10, 12-15, 29-30, 39-41, 59-\n60 and 62-67.\n25\n66. In view of this infoimation suggesting Brunel could provide significant evidence\nof Epstein's trafficking in young girls for sexual abuse, Edwards had Brunel served in New York\nfor deposition. See Notice of Deposition of Jean Luc Brunel attached hereto as Exhibit \"II.\"\nBefore the deposition took place, Brunel's attorney (Tama Kudman of West Palm Beach)\ncontacted Edwards to delay the deposition date. Eventually Kudman informed Edwards in\nJanuary 2009 that Brunel had left the country and was back in France with no plans to return.\nThis information was untrue; Brunel was actually staying with Epstein in West Palm Beach. See\nBanasiak deposition, deposition attachment #16 at 154-160 and 172-175; see also pages from\nEpstein's probation file evidencing Jean Luc Brunel (JLB) staying at his house during that\nrelevant period of time attached Exhibit \"JJ\". As a result, Edwards filed a Motion for Contempt,\nattached hereto as Exhibit \"KK\" (Because Epstein settled this case, the motion was never ruled\nupon.)\n67. Edwards was also informed that Epstein paid for not only Brunel's representation\nduring the civil process but also paid for legal representation for Sarah Kellen (Epstein's\nexecutive assistant and procurer of girls for him to abuse), Larry Visoski (Epstein's personal\npilot), Dave Rogers (Epstein's personal pilot), Larry Harrison (Epstein's personal pilot), Louella\nRabuyo (Epstein's housekeeper), Nadia Marcinkova (Epstein's live-in sex slave), Ghislaine\nMaxwell (manager of Epstein's affairs and businesses), Mark Epstein (Epstein's brother), and\nJanusz Banasiak (Epstein's house manager) It was nearly impossible to take a deposition of\nsomeone that would have helpful information that was not represented by an attorney paid for by\nEpstein. See Edwards Affidavit, Exhibit \"N\" at ¶11.\n26\n68. While Epstein and others were preventing any legitimate discovery into his sexual\nabuse of minor girls, at the same time he was engaging (through his attorneys) in brutal\nquestioning of the girls who had filed civil suits against him, questioning so savage that it made\nlocal headlines. See Jane Musgrave, Victims Seeking Sex offender's Millions See Painful Pasts\nUsed Against Them, Palm Beach Post News, Jan. 23, 2010, available at\nhttp://vvww.palmbeachpost.cominews/crime/victims-seeking-sex-offenders-millions-see-painfulpasts-192988.html\nattached hereto as Exhibit \"LL.\"\nEdwards Pursues Other Lines of Discovery\n69. Because of Epstein's thwarting of discovery and attacks on Edwards's clients,\nEdwards was forced to pursue other avenues of discovery.\nEdwards only pursued legitimate\ndiscovery designed. to further the cases filed against Epstein. See Edwards Affidavit, Exhibit\n``N\"\n70. Edwards notified Epstein's attorneys of his intent to take Bill Clinton's deposition.\nEdwards possessed a legitimate basis for doing so: (a) Clinton was friends with Ghislaine\nMaxwell who was Epstein's longtime companion and helped to run Epstein's companies, kept\nimages of naked underage children on her computer, helped to recruit underage children for\nEpstein, engaged in lesbian sex with underage females that she procured for Epstein, and\nphotographed underage females in sexually explicit poses and kept child pornography on her\ncomputer; (b) it was national news when Clinton traveled with Epstein aboard Epstein's private\nplane to Africa and the news articles classified Clinton as Epstein's friend. (c) the complaint\nfiled on behalf of Jane Doe No. 102 stated generally that she was required by Epstein to be\nsexually exploited by not only Epstein but also Epstein's \"adult male peers, including royalty,\n27\npoliticians, academicians, businessmen, and/or other professional and personal acquaintances\" —\ncategories Clinton and acquaintances of Clinton fall into. The flight logs showed Clinton\ntraveling on Epstein's plane on numerous occasions between 2002 and 2005. See Flight logs\nattached hereto as Exhibit \"MM.\" Clinton traveled on many of those flights with Ghislaine\nMaxwell, Sarah Kellen, and Adriana Mucinska, - all employees and/or co-conspirators of\nEpstein's that were closely connected to Epstein's child exploitation and sexual abuse. The\ndocuments clearly show that Clinton frequently flew with Epstein aboard his plane, then\nsuddenly stopped - raising the suspicion that the friendship abruptly ,ended, perhaps because of\nevents related to Epstein's sexual abuse of children. Epstein's personal phone directory from his\ncomputer contains e-mail addresses for Clinton along with 21 phone numbers for him, including\nthose for his assistant (Doug Band), his schedulers, and what appear to be Clinton's personal\nnumbers. This information certainly leads one to believe that Clinton might well be a source of\nrelevant infoimation and efforts to obtain discovery from him were reasonably calculated to lead\nto admissible evidence. See Exhibits \"B\", \"F\" \"AA\", \"DD\", and \"MM\" and Edwards Affidavit,\nExhibit \"N\" at ¶15.\n71. Bradley J. Edwards, Esq., provided notice that he intended to take the deposition\nof Donald Trump. Edwards possessed a legitimate basis for doing so: (a) The message pads\nconfiscated from Epstein's home indicated that Trump called Epstein's West Palm Beach\nmansion on several occasions during the time period most relevant to my Edwards's clients'\ncomplaints; (b) Trump was quoted in a Vanity Fair article about Epstein as saying \"I've known\nJeff for fifteen years. Terrific guy,\" \"He's a lot of fun to be with. It is even said that he likes\nbeautiful women as much as I do, and many of them are on the younger side. No doubt about it --\n28\nJeffrey enjoys his social life.\" Jeffrey Epstein: International Moneyman of Mystery; He's pals\nwith a passel of Nobel Prize—winning scientists, CEOs like Leslie Wexner of the Limited,\nsocialite Ghislaine Maxwell, even Donald Trump. But it wasn't until he flew Bill Clinton, Kevin\nSpacey, and Chris Tucker to Africa on his private Boeing 727 that the world began to wonder\nwho he is. By Landon Thomas Jr. (See article attached hereto as Exhibit \"NN\") (c) Trump\nallegedly banned Epstein from his Maralago Club in West Palm Beach because Epstein sexually\nassaulted an underage girl at the club; (d) Jane Doe No. 102's complaint alleged that Jane Doe\n102 was initially approached at Trump's Maralago by Ghislaine Maxwell and recruited to be\nMaxwell and Epstein's underage sex slave; (e) Mark Epstein (Jeffii ey Epstein's brother) testified\nthat Trump flew on Jeffrey Epstein's plane with him (the same plane that Jane Doe 102 alleged\nwas used to have sex with underage girls); (f) Trump had been to Epstein's home in Palm Beach;\n(g) Epstein's phone directory from his computer contains 14 phone numbers for Donald Trump,\nincluding emergency numbers, car numbers, and numbers to Trump's security guard and\nhouseman. Based on this information, Edwards reasonably believed that Trump might have\nrelevant information to provide in the cases against Jeffrey Epstein and accordingly provided\nnotice of a possible. deposition. See deposition of Mark Epstein, September 21, 2009, at 48-50\n(Deposition Attachment #19); See Jane Doe 102 v. Epstein, Exhibit \"B\"; Exhibit \"F\";\n\"Exhibit\"J\"; \"N\" and See Edwards Affidavit, Exhibit \"N\" at ¶13.\n72. Edwards provided notice that he intended to depose Alan Dershowitz. Edwards\npossessed a legitimate basis for doing so: (a) Dershowitz is believed to have been friends with\nEpstein for many years; (b) in one news article Dershowitz comments that, \"I'm on my 20th\nbook... The only person outside of my immediate family that I send drafts to is Jeffrey\" The\n29\nTalented Mr. Epstein, By Vicky Ward on January, 2005 in Published Work, Vanity Fair (See\narticle attached as Exhibit \"00\"); (c) Epstein's housekeeper Alfredo Rodriguez testified that\nDershowitz stayed at Epstein's house during the years when Epstein was assaulting minor\nfemales on a daily basis; (d) Rodriguez testified that Dershowitz was at Epstein's house at times\nwhen underage females where there being molested by Epstein (see Alfredo Rodriguez\ndeposition at 278-280, 385, 426-427); (e) Dershowitz reportedly assisted in attempting to\npersuade the Palm Beach State Attorney's Office that because the underage females alleged to\nhave been victims of Epstein's abuse lacked credibility and could not be believed that they were\nat Epstein's house, when Dershowitz himself was an eyewitness to their presence at the house;\n(f) Jane Doe No. 102 stated generally that Epstein forced her to be sexually exploited by not only\nEpstein but also Epstein's \"adult male peers, including royalty, politicians, academicians,\nbusinessmen, and/or other professional and personal acquaintances\" — categories that Dershowitz\nand acquaintances of Dershowitz fall into; (g) during the years 2002-2005 Alan Dershowitz was\non Epstein's plane on several occasions according to the flight logs produced by Epstein's pilot\nand information (described above) suggested that sexual assaults may have taken place on the\nplane; (h) Epstein donated $30 Million one year to the university at which Dershowitz teaches.\nBased on this information, Edwards had a reasonable basis to believe that Dershowitz might\nhave relevant information to provide in the cases against Jeffrey Epstein and accordingly\nprovided notice of a possible deposition. See Dershowitz letters to the State Attorney's office\nattached as Exhibit \"PP\"; Deposition of Alfredo Rodriguez at 278-280; Flight Logs Exhibit\n\"MVP; Exhibits \"B\" and \"00\"; and Edwards Affidavit, Exhibit \"N\" at ¶14.\n30\n73. Epstein's complaint alleges that Edwards provided notice that he wished to take\nthe deposition of Tommy Mattola. That assertion is untrue. Mr. Mattola's deposition was set by\nthe law firm of Searcy Denny Scarola Barnhart and Shipley. See Edwards Affidavit, Exhibit \"N\"\nat T16.\n74. Edwards gave notice that he intended to take David Copperfield's deposition.\nEdwards possessed a legitimate basis for doing so. Epstein's housekeeper and one of the only\nwitnesses who did not appear for deposition with an Epstein bought attorney, Alfredo Rodriguez,\ntestified that David Copperfield was a guest at Epstein's house on several occasions. His name\nalso appears frequently in the message pads confiscated from Epstein's house. It has been\npublicly reported that Copperfield himself has had allegations of sexual misconduct made against\nhim by women claiming he sexually abused them, and one of Epstein's sexual assault victims\nalso alleged that Copperfield had touched her in an improper sexual way while she was at\nEpstein's house. Mr. Copperfield likely has relevant information and deposition was reasonably\ncalculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence. See Edwards Affidavit, Exhibit \"N\" at\n¶17.\n75. Epstein also takes issue with Edwards identifying Bill Richardson as a possible\nwitness. Richardson was properly identified as a possible witness because Epstein's personal\npilot testified to Richardson joining Epstein at Epstein's New Mexico Ranch. There was\ninformation indicating that Epstein had young girls at his ranch which, given the circumstances\nof the case, raised the reasonable inference he was sexually abusing these girls as he had abused\ngirls in West Palm Beach and elsewhere. Richardson had also returned campaign donations that\nwere given to him by Epstein, indicating that he believed that there was something about Epstein\n31\nwith which he did not want to be associated. Richardson was not called to testify nor was he ever\nsubpoenaed to testify. See Edwards Affidavit, Exhibit \"N\" at ¶18.\n76. Edwards learned of allegations that Epstein engaged in sexual abuse of minors on\nhis private aircraft. See Jane Doe 102 Complaint, Exhibit \"B.\" Accordingly, Edwards pursued\ndiscovery to confirm these allegations.\n77. Discovery of the pilot and flight logs was proper in the cases brought by Edwards\nagainst Epstein. Jane Doe filed a federal RICO claim against Epstein that was an active claim\nthrough much of the litigation. The RICO claim alleged that Epstein ran an expansive criminal\nenterprise that involved and depended upon his plane travel. Although Judge Marra dismissed\nthe RICO claim at some point in the federal litigation, the legal team representing\nEdwards' clients intended to pursue an appeal of that dismissal. Moreover, all of the subjects\nmentioned in the RICO claim remained relevant to other aspects of Jane Doe's claims against\nEpstein, including in particular her claim for punitive damages. See Edwards Affidavit, Exhibit\n\"N\" at ¶19.\n78. Discovery of the pilot and flight logs was also proper in the cases brought by\nEdwards against Epstein because of the need to obtain evidence of a federal nexus. Edwards's\nclient Jane Doe was proceeding to trial on a federal claim under 18 U.S.C. § 2255. Section 2255\nis a federal statute which (unlike relevant state statutes) established a minimum level of recovery\nfor victims of the violation of its provisions. Proceeding under the statute, however, required a\n\"federal nexus\" to the sexual assaults. Jane Doe had two grounds on which to argue that such a\nnexus existed to her abuse by Epstein: first, his use of telephone to arrange for girls to be abused;\nand, second, his travel on planes in interstate commerce. During the course of the litigation,\n32\nEdwards anticipated that Epstein would argue that Jane Doe's proof of the federal nexus was\ninadequate. These fears were realized when Epstein filed a summary judgment motion raising\nthis argument. In response, the other attorneys and Edwards representing Jane Doe used the\nflight log evidence to respond to Epstein's summary judgment motion, explaining that the flight\nlogs demonstrated that Epstein had traveled in interstate commerce for the purpose of facilitating\nhis sexual assaults.. Because Epstein chose to settle the case before trial, Judge Marra did not\nrule on the summary judgment motion.\n79. Edwards had further reason to believe and did in fact believe that the pilot and\nflight logs might contain relevant evidence for the cases against Epstein. Jane Doe No. 102's\ncomplaint outlined Epstein's daily sexual exploitation and abuse of underage minors as young as\n12 years old and alleged that Epstein's plane was used to transport underage females to be\nsexually abused by him and his friends. The flight logs accordingly were a potential source of\ninfoimation about either additional girls who were victims of Epstein's abuse or fiiends of\nEpstein who may have witnessed or even participated in the abuse.\nBased on this\ninformation, Edwards reasonably pursued the flight logs in discovery.\n80. In the fall of 2009, Epstein gave a recorded interview to George Rush, a reporter\nwith the New York Daily News about pending legal proceedings. In that interview, Epstein\ndemonstrated an utter lack of remorse for his crimes (but indirectly admitted his crimes) by\nstating:\n• People do not like it when people make good and that was one reason he (Epstein)\nwas being targeted by civil suits filed by young girls in Florida;\n• He (Epstein) had done nothing wrong;\n33\n• He (Epstein) had gone to jail in Florida for soliciting prostitution for no reason;\n• If the same thing (i.e., sexual abuse of minor girls) had happened in New York, he\n(Epstein) would have received only a $200 fine;\n• Bradley J. Edwards was the one causing all of Epstein's problems (i.e., the civil\nsuits brought by Jane Doe and other girls);\n• L.M. came to him as a prostitute and a drug user (i.e., came to Epstein for sex,\nrather than Epstein pursuing her);\n• All the girls suing him are only trying to get a meal ticket;\n• The only thing he might have done wrong was to maybe cross the line a little too\nclosely;\n• He (Epstein) was very upset that Edwards had subpoenaed Ghisline Maxwell, that\nshe was a good person that did nothing wrong (i.e., had done nothing wrong even\nthough she helped procure young girls to satisfy Epstein's sexual desires);\n• With regard to Jane Doe 102 v. Epstein, which involved an allegation that Epstein\nhad repeatedly sexually abused a 15-year-old girl, forced her to have sex with his\nfriends, and flew her on his private plane nationally and internationally for the\npurposes of sexually molesting and abusing her, he (Epstein) flippantly said that\nthe case was dismissed, indicating that the allegations were ridiculous and untrue.\nSee Affidavit of Michael J. Fisten attached hereto as Exhibit \"QQ.\"\n81. The Rush interview also demonstrated perjury (a federal crime) on the part of\nEpstein. Epstein lied about not knowing George Rush. See Epstein Deposition, February 17,\n2010, taken in L.M. v. Jeffrey Epstein, case 50-2008-CA-028051, page 154, line 4 through 155\nline 9, (Deposition .attachment #7), wherein Jeffrey Epstein clearly impresses that he does not\nrecognize George Rush from the New York Daily News. This impression was given despite the\nfact that he gave a lengthy personal interview about details of the case that was tape recorded\nwith George Rush.\n34\nEpstein's Harassment of Witnesses Against Hinz\n82. At all relevant times Edwards has a good faith basis to believe and did in fact\nbelieve that Epstein engaged in threatening witnesses. See Incident Report, Exhibit \"A\" at p. 82,\nU.S. Attorney's Correspondence, Exhibit \"C\" - Indictments drafted by Federal Government\nagainst Epstein; and Edwards Affidavit, Exhibit \"N\" at ¶11.\n83. Despite three no contact orders entered against Epstein (see Exhibit C, supra),\nEdwards learned that Epstein continued to harass his victims. For example, Jane Doe had a trial\nset for her civil case against him on July 19, 2010. As that trial date approached, defendant\nEpstein intimidated her in violation of the judicial no-contact orders. On July 1, 2010, he had a\n\"private investigate\" tail Jane Doe -- following her every move, stopping when she stopped,\ndriving when she drove, refusing to pass when she pulled over. When Jane Doe ultimately drove\nto her home, the \"private investigate' then parked in his car approximately 25 feet from Jane\nDoe house and flashed his high beam lights intermittently into the home.\nEven more\nthreateningly, at about 10:30 p.m., when Jane Doe fled her home in the company of a retired\npolice officer employed by Jane Doe's counsel, the \"private investigate' attempted to follow\nJane Doe despite a request not to do so. The retired officer successfully took evasive action and\nplaced Jane Doe in a secure, undisclosed location that night. Other harassing actions against\nJane Doe also followed. See Motion for Contempt filed by Edwards in Jane Doe v. Epstein\ndetailing the event, including Fisten Affidavit attached to Motion, Composite Exhibit \"RR.\"\nEpstein Settlement of Civil Claims Against Him for Sexual Abuse of Children\n84. The civil cases Edwards filed against Epstein on behalf of L.M., E.W., and Jane\nDoe were reasonably perceived by Edwards to be very strong cases. Because Epstein had\n35\nsexually assaulted these girls, he had committed several serious torts against them and would be\nliable to them for appropriate damages.\nSee Preceding Undisputed Facts. Because of the\noutrageousness of Epstein's sexual abuse of minor girls, Edwards reasonably expected that\nEpstein would also be liable for punitive damages to the girls. Because Edwards could show that\nEpstein had molested children for years and designed a complex premeditated scheme to procure\ndifferent minors everyday to satisfy his addiction to sex with minors, the punitive damages\nwould have to be sufficient to deter him from this illegal conduct that he had engaged in daily for\nyears. Epstein was and is a billionaire. See Complaint, ¶49 (referring to \"Palm Beach\nBillionaire'); see also Epstein Deposition, February 17, 2010, at 172-176 (Deposition\nAttachment #7) (taking the Fifth when asked whether he is a billionaire). Accordingly, Edwards\nreasonably believed the punitive damages that would have to be awarded against Epstein would\nhave been substantial enough to punish him severely enough for his past conduct as well as deter\nhim from repeating his offenses in the future. See Edwards Affidavit, Exhibit \"I\\T” at ¶19.\n85. On July 6, 2010, rather than face trial for the civil suits that had been filed against\nhim by L.M., E.W., and Jane Doe, defendant Epstein settled the cases against him. The kilns of\nthe settlement are confidential. The settlement amounts are highly probative in the instant action\nas Epstein bases his claims that Edwards was involved in the Ponzi scheme on Epstein's inability\nto settle the L.M., E.W., and Jane Doe cases for \"minimal value\". His continued inability to\nsettle the claims for \"minimal value' after the Ponzi scheme was uncovered would be highly\nprobative in discrediting any causal relationship between the Ponzi scheme and Edwards's\nsettlement negotiations. See Edwards Affidavit, Exhibit 'IT' at ¶21.\nEdwards Non-Involvement in Fraud by Scott Rothstein\n36\n86. From in or about 2005, through in or about November 2009, Scott Rothstein\nappears to have run a giant Ponzi scheme at his law funi of Rothstein, Rosenfeldt and Adler P.A.\n(\"RRA\"). This Ponzi scheme involved Rothstein falsely informing investors that settlement\nagreements had been reached with putative defendants based upon claims of sexual harassment\nand/or whistle-blower actions.\nRothstein falsely infoinied the investors that the potential\nsettlement agreements were available for purchase. Plea Agreement at 2, United States v. Scott\nW. Rothstein, No. 9-60331-CR-COHN (S.D. Fla. Jan. 27, 2010) attached hereto as Exhibit \"SS.\"\n87. It has been alleged that among other cases that Rothstein used to lure investors\ninto his Ponzi scheme were the cases against Epstein that were being handled by Bradley J.\nEdwards, Esq. Edwards had no knowledge of the fraud or any such use of the Epstein cases. See\nEdwards Affidavit, Exhibit \"N\" at ¶9.\n88. Bradley J. Edwards, Esq., joined RRA in about April 2009 and left RRA in\nNovember 2009 — a period of less than one year. Edwards would not have joined RRA had he\nbeen aware that Scott Rothstein was running a giant Ponzi scheme at the firm. Edwards left\nRRA shortly after learning of Rothstein's fraudulent scheme. Id. at ¶8.\n89. At no time prior to the public disclosure of Rothstein's Ponzi scheme did Edwards\nknow or have reason to believe that Rothstein was using legitimate claims that Edwards was\nprosecuting against Epstein for any fraudulent or otherwise illegitimate purpose. Id. at ¶20.\n90. Edwards never substantively discussed the merits of any of his three cases against\nEpstein with Rothstein. See Deposition of Bradley J. Edwards taken March 23, 2010, at 110-16.\n(hereinafter \"Edwards Depo\") (Deposition Attachment #22).\n37\n91. On July 20, 2010, Bradley Edwards received a letter from the U.S. Attorney's\nOffice for the Southern District of Florida — the office responsible for prosecuting Rothstein's\nPonzi scheme. The letter indicated that law enforcement agencies had deteamined that Edwards\nwas \"a victim (or potential victim)\" of Scott Rothstein's federal crimes. The letter infolined\nEdwards of his rights as a victim of Rothstein's fraud and promised to keep Edwards informed\nabout subsequent developments in Rothstein's prosecution. See Letter attached hereto as Exhibit\n\"TT.\"\n92. Jeffrey Epstein filed a complaint with the Florida Bar against Bradley Edwards,\nEsq., raising allegations that Edwards and others were involved in the wrongdoing of Scott\nRothstein. After investigating the claim, the Florida Bar dismissed this complaint. See Edwards\nAffidavit, Exhibit \"N\" at ¶23.\nEpstein Takes the Fifth When Asked Substantive Questions About His Claims Against Edwards\n93. On March 17, 2010, defendant Epstein was deposed about his lawsuit against\nEdwards.\nRather than answer substantive questions about his lawsuit, Epstein repeatedly\ninvoked his Fifth Amendment privilege.\nSee Epstein Depo. taken 3/17/10, Deposition\nAttachment #1.\n94.

Edwards, et al.\nCase No.: 50 2009 CA 040800200UMBAG\nHII\nAFFIDAVIT OF RADLEY JAMES EDWARDS\n1. I am an attorney in good standing with the Florida Bar and admitted to practice in the\nSouthern District of Florida. I am currently a partner in the law firm of Farmer, Jaffe,\nWeissing, Edwards, Fistos & Lehrman, P.L.\n2. In 2008, I was a sole practitioner running a perso injury law l„ in Hollywood, FL.\nWhile a sole practitioner I was retained by three clients, L.M., E.W., and Jane Doe to\npursue civil litigation against Je ey Epstein for sexually abusing them while ey were\ninor girls. I agreed to represent these girls, along wi y. attorney Jay Howell (an\nattorney in Jacksonville, Florida with Jay Howell & Associates) and Professor Paul\nCassell (a law professor at the University of Utah College Of Law). I filed s e court\nactions on behalf of L.M. and E.W. and a federal court action on behalf of Jane Doe.\nAll of the cases were filed in the summer of 2008.\n3. My clients received correspondence from the U.S. Department of Justice regarding\ntheir rights as victims of Epstein's federal sex offenses. (True and accurate copies of\nthe letters are attached to Statement of Undisputed Facts as Exhibit \"M\")\n4. mid June 2008, I contacted Assistant United States Attorney Marie Villafafia to\ninform her I represented Jane Doe #1(E.W.) and, later, Jane Doe #2(L.M.). I asked\nto meet to provide information regarding Epstein. AUSA Villafafia did not advise me\nthat a plea agreement had already been negotiated with Epstein's attorneys that would\nblock federal prosecution. AUSA Villafafia 'd indicate that federal inve 'gators h\nconcrete evidence and information that Epstein had sexually molested at least 40\nunderage rainor females, including EN., Jule Doe and L.M.\n5. I also requested from the U.S. Attorney's Office the information and evidence that they\nhad collected regarding Epstein's sexual abuse of his clients. However, the U.S.\nAttorney's Office declined to provide any such information to me. The U.S. Attorney's\nOffice also declined to provide any such information to the other attorneys who\nrepresented victims of Epstein's sexusl assaults.\n6. I was informed that on Friday, June 27, 2008, at approximately 4:15 p.m., AUSA\nVillafafia received a copy of Epstein's proposed state plea agreement and learned that the\nplea was scheduled for 8:30 a.m., Monday, June 30, 2008. She called me to provide\nnotice to my clients regarding the hearing. She did not tell me that the guilty pleas in\nstate court would bring an end to the possibility of federal prosecution pursuant to the\nplea agreement. My clients did not learn and understand this fact until July 11, 2008,\nwhen the agreement was described during a hearing held before Judge Marra on the\nCrime Victims' Rights Act action that I had filed.\n7. In the summer of 2008 I filed complaints against Jeffwy Epstein on behalf of L.M.,\nE.W., and Jane Doe.\n8. In the Spring of 2009 (approximately April), I joined the law farm of Rothstein,\nRosenfeldt and Adler, P.A. (\"RRA\"). I brought my existing clients with me when I\njoined RRA, including L.M., E.W., and Jane Doe. When I joined the firm, I was not\naware that Scott Rothstein was running a Ponzi scheme at RRA. Had I known such a\nPonzi scheme was in place, I would never have joined RRA.\n9. I am now aware that it has been alleged that Scott othstein made fraudulent\npresentations to investors about the lawsuits that I had filed on be of my clients\nagainst Epstein and that it has been alleged that these lawsuits were used to fraudulently\nlure investors into Rothstein's Ponzi scheme. I never met a single investor, h: no part\nin any such presentations and had no knowledge any such fraud was occurring. If these\nallegations are true, I had no knowledge any such fraudulent presentations were\noccurring and no kn wledge of any such improper use of the case files.\n10. Epstein's Complaint against me alleges that Rothstein made false statements about\ncases filed against Epstein, i.e., that RRA 50 anonymous females who had filed suit\nagainst Epstein; that Rothstein sold an interest in personal injury lawsuits, reached\nagreements to share attorneys fees with non-lawyers, paid clients ``tip front\" money; and\nthat he used the judici process to further his Ponzi scheme. If Rothstein did any of\nthese things, I h no knowledge of his actions. Because I maintained close contact\nwith my clients, EW, LM and Jane Doe, and Scott Rothstein never met any of them, I\nknow for certain that none of my clients were paid ''up front\" money by anyone.\n11. Epstein alleges that I attempted to take the depositions of his \"high profile friends and\naccpnkintances\" for no legitimate litigation purpose. This is untrue, as all of my actions\nin representing L.M., E.W., and Jane Doe were aimed at providing them effective\nrepresentation in their civil suits. With regard to Epstein's friends, through documents\nand information obtained in discovery and other means of investigation, I learned that\nEpstein was sexually itolesting 'nor girls on a daily basis and h been for many\nyears. I also learned the unsurprising fact that he was molesting the girls in the privacy\nof his mansion in West Palm Beach, meaning that locating witnesses to corroborate\ntheir testimony would be difficult to find. I also learned, from the course of the\nlitigation, that Epstein and his lawyers were constantly attacking the credibility of the\ngirls, that Epstein's employees were all represented by lawyers who apparently were\npaid for (directly or indirectly) by Epstein, that co-conspirators whose represen :.tion\nwas also apparently paid for by Epstein were all taking the Fifth (like Epstein) rather\nthan provide information in discovery. For example, I was given reason to believe that\nSarah Kellen, Larry Visoski, Larry Harrison, David Rogers, Louella Rabuyo, Nadia\nMarcinkova, Ghislaine Maxwell, Mark Epstein, and Janusz Banasiak all had lawyers\npaid for by Epstein. Because Epstein and the co-conspirators in his child molestation\ncriminal enterprise blocked normal discovery avenues, I needed to search for other\nordinary approaches to strengthen the cases of my clients. Consistent with my training\nand experience, these other ordinary approaches included finding other witnesses who\ncould corroborate allegations of sexual abuse of my clients or other girls. Some of these\nwitnesses were friends of Epstein. Given his social status, it also turned out that some\nof his friends were high-profile. individuals.\n12. In light of information I received suggesting that British socialite Ghislaine Maxwell,\nformer girlfriend and long-time friend of Epstein's, was involved in managing Epstein's\naffairs and companies I had her served for deposition for August 17, 2009. (Deposition\nNotice attached to Statement of Undisputed Facts as Exhibit B). Maxwell was\nrepresented by Brett Jaffe of the New York firm of Cohen and Gresser, and I\nunderstood that her attorney was paid for (directly or indirectly) by Epstein. She was\nreluctant to give her deposition, and I tried to work with her attorney to take her\ndeposition on terms that would be acceptable to both sides. er attorney and I\nnegotiated a confidentiality agreement, under which Maxwell agreed to drop any\nobjections to the deposition. Maxwell, however, still avoided the deposition. On June\n29, 2010, one y before I was to fly to NY to take Maxwell's deposition, her attorney\ninformed me that Maxwell's mother was deathly ill and Maxwell was consequently\nflying to England with no inteh tion of returning and certainly would not return to the\nUnited S tes before the conclusion of Jane Doe's trial period (August 6, 2010).\nDespite that assertion, I later learned that Ghislaine Maxwell was in fact in the country\non approximately July 31, 2010, as she attended s e wedding of Chelsea Clinton\n(former President Clinton's daughter) and was captured in a photograph taken for US\nWeekly 'magazine.\n13. Epstein alleges that there was something improper in the fact that I notified him that I\nintended to take Donald Trump's deposition in the civil suits against him. Trump was\nproperly noticed because: (a) after review of the message pads confiscated from\nEpstein's home, the legal and investigative team assisting my clients learned that Trump\ncalled Epstein's West Palm Beach mansion on several occasions during the time period\nmost relevant to my clients' complaints; (b) Trump was quoted in a Vanity Fair article\nabout Epstein as saying \"I've known Jeff for fifteen years. Terrific guy.\" \"He's a lot\nof fu a to be with. It is eve said that he likes beau I wo en as much as I do, and\na y of then are on the you ger side. No doubt about it — Jeffrey enjoys his social\nlife.\" Jeffrey Epstein: International Moneyman of Mystery; He's pals with a passel of\nNobel Prize—wi ning scientists, CEOs like Leslie Wexner of the Limited, socialite\nGhislaine Maxwell, even Donald Trump. But it wasn't until he flew Clinton,\nKevin Spacey, awed Chris Tucker to Africa on his private Boeing 727 that the world\nbegan to wonder who he is. By Lando Thomas Jr.; (c) I learned through a source\nthat Trump banned Epstein from his Maralago Club in West Pahn Beach because\nEpstein sexually assaulted an underage girl at the club; (d) Jane Doe No. 102's\ncomplaint alleged that Jane Doe 102 was initially approached at Trump's Maralago by\nGhislaine Maxwell and recruited to be Maxwell and Epstein's underage sex slave; (e)\nMark Epstein (Jefftzy Epstein's brother) testified that Trump flew on Jeffrey Epstein's\nplane with him (the same plane that Jane Doe 102 alleged was used to have sex with\nunderage girls) deposition of Mark Epstein, September 21, 2009 at 48-50; (f) Trump\nvisited Epstein at his home in Palm Beach — the same home where Epstein abused\nminor girls daily; (g) Epstein's phone directory from his computer contains 14 phone\nnumbers for Donald Trump, including emergency numbers, car numbers, and numbers\nto Trump's security guard and houseman. Based on this information, I believed that\nTrump might have relevant information to provide in the cases against Jeffrey Epstein\nand accordingly provided notice of a possible deposition.\n14. Epstein alleges that there was something improper in the fact that I notified him that I\nintended to take Alan Dershowi's deposition in the civil suits against him. IDershowitz\nwas properly noticed because: (a) Dershowitz has been friends with Epstein for many\nyears; (b) in one news article Dershowitz comments t, \"I'm on my 20th book... The\nonly person outside of my immediate family that I send drafts to is Jeffrey\" The\nTalented Mr. Epstein, By Vicky Ward on J uary, 2005 in Published Work, Vanity\nFair; (c) Epstein's housekeeper Alfredo Rodriguez testified that Dershowitz stayed at\nEpstein's house during the years most relev t to my clients; (d) Rodriguez testified\nthat Dershowitz was at Epstein's house at times when underage females where there\nbeing molested by Epstein (see Alfredo Rodriguez deposition at 278-280, 385, 426\n427); (e) Dershowitz was reportedly involved in persuading the Palm Beach State\nAttorney's office ot to file felony criminal charges against Epstein because\nunderage females lacked credibility and thus could not be believed that they were at\nEpstein's house, despite him being an eyewitness that the underage girls were actually\nthere; (f) Jane Doe No. 102 stated generally that Epstein forced her to be sexually\nexploited by not only Epstein but also Epstein's \"adult male peers, includhag royalty,\npoliticians, academicians, businessmen, and/or other professional and personal\nacquaintances\" — categories that Dershowitz and acquaintances of Dershowitz fall into;\n(g) during the years 2002-2005 Alan Dershowitz was on Epstein's plane on several\noccasions according to the flight logs produced by Epstein's pilot and information\n(described above) suggested that sexual assaults may have taken place on the plane; (h)\nEpstein donated Harvard $30 Million dollars one year, and Harvard was one of the only\ninstitutions that did not return Epstein's donation after he was charged with sex offenses\nagainst children. Based on this information, I believed that Dershowitz might have\nrelevant information to provide in e cases against Jeffrey Epstein and accordingly\nprovided notice of a possible deposition.\n15. Epstein alleges that there was something improper in the fact that I notified him that I\nintended to take Bill Clinton's deposition. Clinton was properly noticed because: (a) it\nwas well known that Clinton was friends with Ghislaine Maxwell, and several witnesses\nhad provided information that Maxwell helped to run Epstein's companies, kept images\nof naked underage children on her computer, helped to recruit underage children for\nEpstein, engaged in lesbian sex with underage females that she procured for Epstein,\nand photographed underage females in sexually explicit poses and kept child\npornography on her computer; (b) newpaper articles stated that Clinton had an affair\nwith Ghislaine Maxwell, who was thought to be second in charge of Epstein's child\nmolestation ring. The Cleveland Leader newspaper, April 10, 2009; (c) it was national\nnews when Clinton traveled with Epstein (and Maxwell) aboard Epstein's private plane\nto Africa and the news articles classified Clinton as Epstein's friend; (d) the flight logs\nfor the relevant years 2002 - 2005 showed Clinton traveling on Epstein's plane on more\nthan 10 occasions and his assistant, Doug Band, traveled on many more occasions; (e)\nJane Doe No. 102 stated generally that she was required by Epstein to be sexually\nexploited by not only Epstein but also Epstein's \"adult male peers, including royalty,\npoliticians, academicians, businessmen, and/or other professional and personal\nacquaintances\" — categories Clinton and acquaintances of Clinton fall into; (f) flight\nlogs showed that Clinton took many flights with Epstein, Ghislaine Maxwell, Sarah\nKellen, and Adriana Mucinska, -- all employees and/or co-conspirators of Epstein's that\nwere closely .connected to Epstein's child exploitation and sexual abuse; (g) Clinton\nfrequently flew with Epstein aboard his plane, then suddenly stopped — raising the\nsuspicion that the friendship abruptly ended, perhaps because of events related to\nEpstein's sexual abuse of children; (h) Epstein's personal phone directory from his\ncomputer contains e-mail addresses for Clinton along with 21 phone numbers for him,\nincluding those for his assistant (Doug Band), his schedulers, and what appear to be\nClinton's personal numbers. Based on this information, 1 believed that Clinton might\nhave relevant information to provide in the cases against Jeffrey Epstein and\naccordingly provided notice of a possible deposition.\n16. Epstein alleges that Tommy Mottola was improperly noticed with a deposition. 1 did\nnot notice Mattola for deposition. He was noticed for deposition by a law firm\nrepresenting another one of Epstein's victims — not by me.\n17. Epstein alleges that ere was something improper in the fact that 1 notified him\nintended to take the illusionist David Copperfield's deposition. Copperfield was\nproperly noticed because: (a) Epstein's housekeeper Alfredo Rodriguez testified that\nDavid Copperfield was a guest on several occasions Epstein's house; (b) according to\nthe message pads confiscated from Epstein's house, Copperfield called Epstein quite\nfrequently and left messages that indicated they socialized together; (c) Copperfield\nhimself has had similar allegations made against him by women claiming he sexually\nabused them; (d) one of Epstein's sexual assault victims also alleged that Copperfield\nhad touched her in an improper sexual way while she was at Epstein's house. eased on\nthis information, believed that Copperfield might have relevant information to provide\nin the cases against Jeffrey Epstein and accordingly provided notice of a possible\ndeposition.\n18. Epstein alleges that there was something improper in the fact that 1 identified Bill\nRichardson as a possible witness against him in the civil cases. Richardson was\nproperly identified as a possible witness because Epstein's personal pilot testified to\nRichardson joining Epstein at Epstein's New Mexico Ranch. See deposition of Larry\nMorrison, October 6, 2009, at 167-169. There was information indicating that Epstein\nhad young girls at his ranch which, given the circumstances of the case, raised the\nreasonable inference he was sexually abusing these girls since he had regularly and\nfrequently abused girls in West Palm Beach and elsewhere. Richardson had also\nreturned campaign donations that were given to him by Epstein, in 'eating that he\nbelieved that there was something about Epstein that he did not want to be associated\nwith. Richardson was not called to testify nor was he ever subpoenaed to testify.\n19. Epstein alleges that discovery of plane and pilot logs was improper during discovery in\nthe civil cases against him. Discovery of these subjects was clearly proper and\nnecessary because: (a) Jane Doe filed a federal RICO claim against Epstein that was an\nactive claim through much of the litigation. The RICO claim alleged that Epstein ran an\nexpansive criminal enterprise that involved and depended upon his plane travel.\nAlthough Judge Marra dismissed the RICO claim at some point in the federal litigation,\nthe legal team representing my clients intended to pursue an appeal of that dismissal.\nMoreover, all of the subjects mentioned in the RICO claim remained relevant to other\naspects of Jane Doe's claims against Epstein, including in particular her claim for\npunitive damages; (b) Jane Doe also filed and was proceeding to trial on a federal claim\nunder 18 U.S.C. § 2255. Section 2255 is a federal statute which (unlike other state\nstatutes) guaranteed a minimum level of recovery for Jane Doe. Proceeding under the\nstatute, however, required a \"federal nexus\" to the sexual assaults. Jane Doe had two\ngrounds on which to argue that such a nexus existed to her abuse by Epstein: first, his\nuse of the telephone to arrange for girls to be abused; and, seco d, his vel on planes\nin interstate commerce. During the course of the litigation, I anticipated that Epstein\nwould argue that Jane Doe's proof of the federal nexus was inadequate. These fears\nwere realized when Epstein filed a summary judgment motion raising this argument. In\nresponse, the other attorneys and I representing Jane Doe used the flight log evidence\nto res nd to Epstein's summary judgment motion, explaining that the flight logs\ndemonstrated that Epstein had traveled in interstate commerce for the purpose of\nfacilitating his sexual assaults. Because Epstein chose to settle the case before trial,\nJudge Marra did not rule on the summary judgment motion. (c) Jane Doe No. 102's\ncomplaint outlined Epstein's daily sexual exploitation and abuse of underage minors as\nyoung as 12 years old and alleged that he used his plane to transport underage females\nto be sexually abused by him and his friends. The flight logs accordingly rnight have\ninformation about either additional girls who were victims of Epstein's abuse or 'ends\nof Epstein who may have witnessed or even participated in the abuse. Based on this\ninformation, I believed that the flight logs and related information was relevant\ninformatio to prove e cases against Jeffrey Epstein and accordingly I pursued them\nin discovery.\n20. In approximately November 2009, the existence of Scott Rothstein's Ponzi scheme\nbecame public knowledge. It was at that time that I, o,i, g with many other reputable\nattorneys at RRA, first became aware of Rothstein criminal scheme. At that time, I left\nRRA with several other RRA attorneys to form the law firm of Farmer Jaffe Weissing\nEdwards Fistos and Lehrman (\"Farmer Jaffe\"). I was thus with RRA for less than one\nyear.\n21. In July 2010, along with other attorneys at Farmer Jaffe and Professor Cassell, I reached\nfavorable settlement terms for my three clients L.M., E.W., and Jane Doe in their\nlawsuits against Epstein.\n22. On July 20, 2010, I received a letter from the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern\nDistrict of Florida — the office responsible for prosecuting Rothstein's Ponzi scheme.\nThe letter indicated that law enforcement agencies had determined that I was \"a victim\n(or potential victim)\" of Scott Rothstein's federal crimes. The letter informed me of my\nrights as a victim of Rothstein's federal crimes and promised to keep me informed about\n/01\nsubsequent developments in his prosecution. A copy of this letter is attached to this\nAffidavit. (A copy of the letter is attached to Statement of Undisputed Facts as Exhibit\nUU)\n23. Jeffrey Epstein also filed a complaint with the Florida Bar against me. His complaint\nalleged that I had been involved in Rothstein's scheme and had thereby violated various\nrules of professional responsibility. The Florida Bar investigated and dismissed the\ncomplaint.\n24. I have reviewed the Statement of Undisputed Facts filed contem raneously with this\nAffidavit. Each of the assertions concerning what I learned, what I did, and the good\nfaith beliefs formed by me in the course of my prosecutions of claims against Jeffrty\nEpstein as contained in the Statement of Undisputed Facts is true, and the foundations\nset out as support for my beliefs are true and correct to e best of my knowledge.\n25. All actions taken by me in the course of my prosecution of claims against Jeffrey\nEpstein were based upon a good faith belief that they were reasonable, necessary, and\nethically proper to fulfill my obligation to zealously represent the interests of my\nclie ts.\nI declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true and correct.\nDated:\n.24\n2010\nIN THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE 15TH\nJUDICIAL CIRCUIT IN AND FOR PALM\nBEACH COUNTY, FLORIDA\nCase No.: 50 2009CA 040800)0OCKMBAG\nJEFFREY EPSTEIN,\nPlaintiff,\nvs.\nSCOTT ROTHSTEIN, individually, and\nBRADLEY J. EDWARDS, individually,\nDefendants,\nDEFENDANT BRADLEY J. EDWARDS'S\nRENEWED MOTION FOR FINAL SUMMARY JUDGMENT\nDefendant, Bradley J. Edwards, Esq., by and through his undersigned counsel and\npursuant to Rule 1.510, Florida Rules of Civil Procedure, hereby moves for Final Summary\nJudgment and in support thereof states as follows:\nI. INTRODUCTION\nThe pleadings and discovery taken to date show that there is no genuine issue as to any\nmaterial facts and that Bradley J. Edwards, Esq. is entitled to summary judgment for all claims\nbrought against him in Plaintiff Jeffrey Epstein's Second Amended Complaint. Not only is there\nan absence of competent evidence to demonstrate that Edwards participated in any fraud against\nEpstein, the evidence uncontrovertibly demonstrates the propriety of every aspect of Edwards'\ninvolvement in the prosecution of legitimate claims against Epstein. Epstein sexually abused\nthree clients of Edwards — L.M., E.W., and Jane Doe — and Edwards properly and successfully\nrepresented them in a civil action against Epstein. Nothing in Edwards's capable and competent\nrepresentation of his clients can serve as the basis for a civil lawsuit against him. Allegations\nabout Edwards's participation in or knowledge of the use of the civil actions against Epstein in a\n\"Ponzi Scheme\" are not supported by any competent evidence and could never be supported by\ncompetent evidence as they are entirely false.\nA. Epstein's Complaint\nEpstein's Second Amended Complaint essentially alleges that Epstein was damaged by\nEdwards, acting in concert with Scott Rothstein (President of the Rothstein Rosenfeldt Adler law\nfiiiii (\"RRA\") where Edwards worked for a short period of time). Epstein appears to allege that\nEdwards joined Rothstein in the abusive prosecution of sexual assault cases against Epstein to\n\"pump\" the cases to Ponzi scheme investors. As described by Epstein, investor victims were\ntold by Rothstein that three minor girls who were sexually assaulted by Epstein: L.M., E.W., and\nJane Doe were to be paid up-front money to prevent those girls from settling their civil cases\nagainst Epstein. In Epstein's view, these child sexual assault cases had \"minimal value\"\n(Complaint & 42(h)), and Edwards's refusal to force his clients to accept modest settlement\noffers is claimed to breach some duty that Edwards owed to Epstein. Interestingly, Epstein never\nstates that he actually made any settlement offers.\nThe supposed \"proof' of the Complaint's allegations against Edwards includes\nEdwards's alleged contacts with the media, his attempts to obtain discovery from high-profile\npersons with whom Epstein socialized, and use of \"ridiculously inflammatory\" language in\narguments in court. Remarkably, Epstein has filed such allegations against Edwards despite the\nfact that Epstein had sexually abused each of Edwards's clients and others while they were\n2\nminors. Indeed, in discovery Epstein has asserted his Fifth Amendment privilege rather than\nanswer questions about the extent of the sexual abuse of his many victims. Even more\nremarkably, since filing his suit against Edwards, Epstein has now settled the three cases\nEdwards handled for an amount that Epstein insisted be kept confidential. Without violating the\nstrict confidentiality terms required by Epstein, the cases did not settle for the \"minimal value\"\nthat Epstein suggested in his Complaint. Because Epstein relies upon the alleged discrepancy\nbetween the \"minimal value Epstein ascribed to the claims and the substantial value Edwards\nsought to recover for his clients, the settlement amounts Epstein voluntarily agreed to pay while\nthese claims against Edwards were pending will be disclosed to the court in-camera.\nB. Summary of the Argument\nBradley J. Edwards, Esq., is entitled to summary judgment on Epstein's frivolous claim\nfor at least three separate reasons.\nFirst, because Epstein has elected to hide behind the shield of his right against self\nincrimination to preclude his disclosing any relevant information about the criminal activity at\nthe center of his claims, he is barred from prosecuting this case against Edwards. Under the\nwell-established \"sword and shield\" doctrine, Epstein cannot seek damages from Edwards while\nat the same time asserting a Fifth Amendment privilege to block relevant discovery. His case\nmust therefore be dismissed.\nSecond, all of Edwards' conduct in the prosecution of valid claims against Epstein is\nprotected by the litigation privilege.\nThird, and most fundamentally, Epstein's lawsuit should be dismissed because it is not\nonly unsupported by but is also directly contradicted by all of the record evidence. From the\n3\nbeginning, Edwards diligently represented three victims of sexual assaults perpetrated by\nEpstein. As explained in detail below, each and every one of Edwards's litigation decisions was\ngrounded in proper litigation judgment about the need to pursue effective discovery against\nEpstein, particularly in the face of Epstein's stonewalling tactics.\nEdwards's successful\nrepresentation finally forced Epstein to settle and pay appropriate damages. Effective and proper\nrepresentation of child victims who have been repeatedly sexually assaulted cannot form the\nbasis of a separate, !`satellite\" lawsuit, and therefore Edwards is entitled to summary judgment on\nthese grounds as well.\nThe truth is the record is entirely devoid of any evidence to support Epstein's claims and\nis completely and consistently corroborative of Edwards's sworn assertion of innocence. Put\nsimply, Epstein has.made allegations that have no basis in fact. To the contrary, his lawsuit was\nmerely a desperate measure by a serial pedophile to prevent being held accountable for\nrepeatedly sexually abusing minor females. Epstein's ulterior motives in filing and prosecuting\nthis lawsuit are blatantly obvious. Epstein's behavior is another clear demonstration that he feels\nhe lives above the law and that because of his wealth he can manipulate the system and pay for\nlawyers to do his dirty work - even to the extent of having them assert baseless claims against\nother members of the Florida Bar. Epstein's Second Amended Complaint against Edwards is\nnothing short of a far-fetched fictional fairy-tale with absolutely no evidence whatsoever to\nsupport his preposterous claims. It was his last ditch effort to escape the public disclosure by\nEdwards and his clients of the nature, extent, and sordid details of his life as a serial child\nmolester. Edwards's Motion for Summary Judgment should be granted without equivocation.\n4\nARGUMENT\nII. EDWARDS IS ENTITLED TO SUMMARY JUDGMENT ON EPSTEIN'S\nCLAIM BECAUSE THERE ARE NO MATERIAL DISPUTED FACTS AND THE\nUNDISPUTED FACTS ESTABLISH THAT EDWARDS'S CONDUCT COULD\nNOT POSSIBLY FORM THE BASIS OF ANY LIABILITY IN FAVOR OF EPSTEIN\nA. The Summary Judgment Standard.\nRule 1.510(c), Florida Rules of Civil Procedure, provides that a court may enter summary\njudgment when the.pleadings, depositions and factual showings reveal that there is no genuine\nissue of material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. See\nSnyder v. Cheezem Development Corp., 373 So. 2d 719, 720 (Fla. 2d DCA 1979); Rule 1.510(c),\nFla. R. Civ. P. Once the moving party conclusively establishes that the nonmoving party cannot\nprevail, it is incumbent on the nonmoving party to submit evidence to rebut the motion for\nsummary judgment. See Holl v. Talcott, 191 So. 2d 40, 43 (Fla. 1966). It is not enough for the\nopposing party merely to assert that an issue of fact does exist. Fisel v. 11Tynns, 667 So.2d 761,\n764 (Fla.1996); Landers v. Milton, 370 So.2d 368, 370 (F1a.1979) (same).\nMoreover, it is well-recognized that the non-moving party faced with a summary\njudgment motion supported by appropriate proof may not rely on bare, conclusory assertions\nfound in the pleadings to create an issue and thus avoid summary judgment. Instead, the party\nmust produce counter-evidence establishing a genuine issue of material fact. See Bryant v.\nShands Teaching Hospital and Clinics, Inc., 479 So.2d 165, 168 (Fla. 1st Dist. Ct. App. 1985);\nsee also Lanzner v. City of North Miami Beach, 141 So.2d 626 (Fla. 3d Dist Ct. App. 1962)\n(recognizing that mere contrary allegations of complaint were not sufficient to preclude summary\njudgment on basis of facts established without dispute). Where the nonmoving party fails to\n5\npresent evidence rebutting the motion for summary judgment and there is no genuine issue of\nmaterial fact, then entry of judgment is proper as a matter of law. See Davis v. Hathaway, 408\nSo. 2d 688, 689 (Fla. 2d Dist. Ct. App. 1982); see also Holl, 191 So. 2d at 43.\nB. Epstein's Claim Regarding Edwards Have Absolutely No Factual Basis.\nThis is not a complicated case for granting summary judgment. To the contrary, this is a\nsimple case for summary judgment because each and every one of Epstein's claim against\nEdwards lacks any merit whatsoever.'\n1. Epstein's allegations regarding Edwards' involvement in Rothstein's \"Ponzi\nScheme\" are unsupported and unsupportable because he was simply not\ninvolved in any such scheme.\na. Edwards Had No Involvement in the Ponzi Scheme.\nThe bulk of Epstein's claims against Edwards hinge on the premise that Edwards was\ninvolved in a Ponzi •scheme run by Scott Rothstein. Broad allegations of wrongdoing on the part\nof Edwards are scattered willy-nilly throughout the complaint. None of the allegations provide\nany substance as to how Edwards actually assisted the Ponzi scheme, and allegations that he\n\"knew or should have known\" of its existence are based upon an impermissible pyramiding of\ninferences. In any event, these allegations all fail for one straightforward reason: Edwards was\nsimply not involved in any Ponzi scheme. He has provided sworn testimony and an affidavit in\nsupport of that assertion, and there is not (and could never be) any contrary evidence.\nEdwards has now been deposed at length in this case. As his deposition makes crystal\nclear, he had no knowledge of any fraudulent activity in which Scott Rothstein may have been\nI A decision by the Court to grant summary judgment on Epstein's claims against Edwards would not affect\nEpstein's claims against Scott Rothstein. Epstein has already chosen to dismiss all of his claims against L.M., the\nonly other defendant named in the suit.\n6\ninvolved. See, e.g., Edwards Depo. at 301-02 (Q: \" . . . [W]ere you aware that Scott Rothstein\nwas trying to market Epstein cases . . . ?\" A: \"No.\").\nEdwards has supplemented his deposition answers with an Affidavit that declares in no\nuncertain terms his lack of involvement in any fraud perpetrated by Rothstein.\nSee, e.g.,\nEdwards Affidavit attached to Statement of Undisputed Material Facts as Exhibit '1\\1' at ¶8-10,\n¶20, ¶22-23. Indeed, no reasonable juror could find that Edwards was involved in the scheme, as\nEdwards joined RRA well after Rothstein began his fraud and would have been already deeply in\ndebt. In fact, the evidence of Epstein's crimes is now clear, and Edwards's actions in this case\nwere entirely in keeping with his obligation to provide the highest possible quality of legal\nrepresentation for his clients to obtain the best result possible.\nIn view of this clear evidence rebutting all allegations against him, Epstein must now\n\"produce counter-evidence establishing a genuine issue of material fact.\" See Bryant v. Shands\nTeaching Hospital and Clinics, Inc., 479 So.2d 165, 168 (Fla. 1st Dist. Ct. App. 1985). Epstein\ncannot do this. Indeed, when asked at his deposition whether he had any evidence of Edwards's\ninvolvement, Epstein declined to answer, purportedly on attorney-client privilege grounds:\nQ. I want to know whether you have any knowledge of evidence that Bradley\nEdwards personally ever participated in devising a plan through which were sold\npurported confidential assignments of a structured payout settlement? . . .\nA. I'd like to answer that question by saying that the newspapers have reported\nthat his firm was engaged in fraudulent structured settlements in order to fleece\nunsuspecting Florida investors. With respect to my personal knowledge, I'm\nunfortunately going to, today, but I look forward to at some point being able to\ndisclose it, today I'm going to have to assert the attorney/client privilege.\nSee Deposition of Jeffrey Epstein, Mar. 17, 2010 (hereinafter \"Epstein Depo.\") at 67-68.\nTherefore summary judgment should be granted for Edwards on all claims involving any Ponzi\nscheme by Rothstein.\n7\nb. Epstein's Allegations of Negligence by Edwards are Unfounded and Not\nActionable in Any Event.\nIn his Second Amended Complaint Epstein recognizes at least the possibility that\nEdwards was not involved in any Rothstein Ponzi scheme. Therefore, seemingly as a fallback,\nEpstein alleges without explanation that Edwards \"should have known\" about the existence of\nthis concealed Ponzi scheme. Among other problems, this fallback negligence position suffers\nthe fatal flaw that it does not link at all to the intentional tort of abuse of process alleged in the\ncomplaint.\nEpstein's negligence claim is also deficient because it simply fails to satisfy the\nrequirements for a negligence cause of action:\n\"Four elements are necessary to sustain a negligence claim: 1. A duty, or\nobligation, recognized by the law, requiring the [defendant] to conform to a\ncertain standard of conduct, for the protection of others against unreasonable\nrisks. 2. A failure on the [defendant's] part to conform to the standard required: a\nbreach of the duty . . . 3. A reasonably close causal connection between he\nconduct and the resulting injury. This is what is commonly known as 'legal\ncause,' or 'proximate cause,' and which includes the notion of cause in fact. 4.\nActual loss or damage.\nCurd v. MOsaic Fertilizer, LLC, S o.2d , 2010 WL 2400384 at *9 (Fla. 2010). Epstein\ndoes not allege a particular duty on the part of Edwards that has been breached. Nor does\nEpstein explain how any breach of the duty might have proximately caused him actual damages.\nSummary judgment is therefore appropriate for these reasons as well.\nFinally, for the sake of completeness, it is worth noting briefly that no reasonable jury\ncould find Edwards to have been negligent in failing to anticipate that a managing pal tner at his\nlaw firm would be involved in an unprecedented Ponzi scheme. Scott Rothstein deceived not\n8\nonly Edwards but also more than 60 other reputable lawyers at a major law firm. Cf . Sun\nSentinel, Fort Lauderdale, Dec. 11, 2009, 2009 WLNR 25074193 at *1 (\"Sure, some outlandish\nJohn Grisham murder plot[s] sound far-fetched. But if you asked me a few months ago if Scott\nRothstein was fabricating federal court orders and forging a judge's signature on documents to\nallegedly fleece his friends, as federal prosecutors allege, I would have said that was far-fetched,\ntoo.\"). No reasonable lawyer could have expected that a fellow member of the bar would have\nbeen involved in such a plot. Nobody seemed to know of Rothstein's Ponzi scheme, not even his\nbest friends, or the people he did business with on a daily basis, or even his wife. Many of the\nattorneys at RRA had been there for years and knew nothing. Edwards was a lawyer at RRA for\nless than 8 months and had very few personal encounters with Rothstein during his time at the\nfirm, yet Epstein claims that he should have known of Rothstein's intricate Ponzi scheme. No\ndoubt for this reason the U.S. Attorney's Office has now listed Edwards as a \"victim\" of\nRothstein's crimes. See Statement of Undisputed Facts filed contemporaneously.\nEpstein's Complaint does not offer any specific reason why a jury would conclude that\nEdwards was negligent, and he chose not to offer any explanation of his claim at his deposition.\nAccordingly, Edwards is entitled to summary judgment to the extent the claim against him is\nsomehow dependent upon his negligence in failing to discover Rothstein's Ponzi scheme.\n2. Edwards is Entitled to Summary Judgment to the Extent the Claim Against\nHim is Dependent on Allegations Regarding \"Pumping the Cases\" Because\nHe Was Properly Pursuing the Interests of His Three Clients Who Had Been\nSexually Abused by Epstein.\nEpstein alleges that Edwards somehow improperly enhanced the value of the three civil\ncases he had filed against Epstein. Edwards represented three young women — L.M., E.W., and\nJane Doe — by filing civil suits against Epstein for his sexual abuse of them while they were\n9\nminors. Epstein purports to find a cause of action for this by alleging that Edwards somehow\nwas involved in \"'pumping' these three cases to investors.\"\nAs just explained, to the extent that Epstein is alleging that Edwards somehow did\nsomething related to the Ponzi scheme, those allegations fail for the simple reason that Edwards\nwas not involved in any such scheme. Edwards, for example, could not have possibly \"pumped\"\nthe cases to investors when he never participated in any communication with investors.\nEpstein's \"pumping\" claims, however, fail for an even more basic reason: Edwards was\nentitled — indeed ethically obligated as an attorney — to secure the maximum recovery for his\nclients during the course of his legal representation. As is well known, lals an advocate, a\nlawyer zealously asserts the client's position under the rules of the adversary system.\" Fla. Rules\nof Prof. Conduct, Preamble.\nEdwards therefore was required to pursue (unless otherwise\ninstructed by his clients) a maximum recovery against Epstein. Edwards, therefore, cannot be\nliable for doing something that his ethical duties as an attorney required.2\nAnother reason that Epstein's claims that Edwards was \"pumping\" cases for investors\nfails is that Edwards filed all three cases almost a year before he was hired by RRA or even knew\nof :Scott Rothstein.\nEpstein makes allegations that the complaints contained sensational\nallegations for the purposes of luring investors; however, language in the complaints remained\nvirtually unchanged from the first filing in 2008 and from the overwhelming evidence the Court\ncan see for itself that all of the facts alleged by Edwards in the complaints were true.\nEpstein ultimately paid to settle all three of the cases Edwards filed against him for more\nmoney than he paid to settle any of the other claims against him. At Epstein's request, the terms\n2 In a further effort to harass Edwards, Epstein also filed a bar complaint with the Florida Bar against Edwards. The\nFlorida Bar has dismissed that complaint. See Statement of Undisputed Facts.\n10\nof the settlement were kept confidential. The sum that he paid to settle all these cases is\ntherefore not filed with this pleading and will be provided to the court for in-camera review.\nEpstein chose to make this payment as the result of a federal court ordered mediation process,\nwhich he himself sought (over the objection of Jane Doe, Edwards' client in federal court) in an\neffort to resolve the case.\nSee Defendant's Motion for Settlement Conference, or in the\nAlternative, Motion to Direct Parties back to Mediation, Doe v. Epstein, No. 9:08-CV-80893\n(S.D. Fla. June 28, 2010) (Marra, J.) (doc. #168) attached hereto as Exhibit A. Notably,\nEpstein sought this settlement conference — and ultimately made his payments as a result of that\nconference - in July 2010, more than seven months after he filed this lawsuit against Edwards.\nAccordingly, Epstein could not have been the victim of any scheme to \"pump\" the cases against\nhim, because he never paid to settle the cases until well after Edwards had left RRA and had\nsevered all connection with Scott Rothstein (December 2009).\nIn addition, if Epstein had thought that there was some improper coercion involved in, for\nexample, Jane Doe's case, his remedy was to raise the matter before Federal District Court Judge\nKenneth A. Marra who was presiding over the matter. Far from raising any such claim, Epstein\nsimply chose to settle that case. He is therefore now barred by the doctrine of res judicata from\nsomehow re-litigating what happened in (for example) the Jane Doe case. \"The doctrine of res\njudicata makes a judgment on the merits conclusive not only as to every matter which was\noffered and received to sustain or defeat the claim, but as to every other matter which might with\npropriety have been litigated and determined in that action.\" AMEC Civil, LLC v. State Dept. of\nTransp., So.2d , 2010 WL 1542634 at *2 (Fla. 1st Dist. Ct. App. 2010) (quoting Kiinbrell\nv. Paige, 448 So.2d 1009, 1012 (Fla. 1984). Obviously, any question of improper \"pumping\" of a\n11\nparticular case could have been resolved in that vet)) case rather than now re-litigated in satellite\nlitigation.\n3. Edwards is Entitled to Summary Judgment on the Claim of\nAbuse of Process Because He Acted Properly Within the Boundaries of the\nLaw in Pursuit of the Legitimate Interests of his Clients.\nEpstein's Second Amended Complaint raises several claims of \"abuse of process.\" An\nabuse of process claim requires proof of three elements: \"(1) that the defendant made an illegal,\nimproper, or perverted use of process; (2) that the defendant had ulterior motives or purposes in\nexercising such illegal, improper, or perverted use of process; and (3) that, as a result of such\naction on the part of the defendant, the plaintiff suffered damage. \" S & Ilnvestments v. Payless\nFlea Market, Inc., 36 So.3d 909, 917 (Fla. 4 th Dist. Ct. App. 2010) (internal citation omitted). In\nfact, this Court is very familiar with this cause of action, as Edwards has correctly stated this\ncause in his counterclaim against Epstein. Edwards is entitled to summary judgment because\nEpstein cannot prove these elements.\nThe first element of an abuse of process claim is that a defendant made \"an illegal,\nimproper, or perverted use of process.\" On the surface, Epstein's Complaint appears to contain\nseveral allegations of such improper process.\nOn examination, however, each of these\nallegations amounts to nothing other than a claim that Epstein was unhappy with some\ndiscovery proceeding, motion or argument made by Edwards. This is not the stuff of an abuse of\nprocess claim, particularly where Epstein fails to allege that he was required to do something as\nthe result of Edwards' pursuit of the claims against him. See Marty v. Gresh, 501 So.2d 87, 90\n(Fla. 1st Dist. Ct. App. 1987) (affirming summary judgment on an abuse of process claim where\n\"appellant's lawsuit caused appellee to do nothing against her will\").\n12\nIn any event, none of the allegations of \"improper\" process can survive summary\njudgment scrutiny, because every action Edwards took was entirely proper and reasonably\ncalculated to lead to the successful prosecution of the pending claims against Epstein as detailed\nin Edwards' Affidavit.\nEpstein also fails to meet the second element of an abuse of process claim: that Edwards\nhad some sort of ulterior motive. The case law is clear that on an abuse of process claim a\n\"plaintiff must prove that the process was used for an immediate purpose other than that for\nwhich it was designed.\" MI Investments v. Payless Flea Market, Inc., 36 So.3d 909, 917 (Fla.\n4th Dist. Ct. App. 2010) (citing Biondo v. Powers, 805 So.2d 67, 69 (Fla. 4th Dist. Ct. App. 2002).\nAs a consequence, \"[w]here the process was used to accomplish the result for which it was\nintended, regardless of an incidental or concurrent motive of spite or ulterior purpose, there is no\nabuse of process.\" Id. (internal quotation omitted). Here, Edwards has fully denied any\nimproper motive, See Statement of Undisputed Facts, and Epstein has no evidence of any such\nmotivation. Indeed, it is revealing that Epstein chose not to ask even a single question about this\nsubject during the deposition of Edwards. In addition, all of the actions that Epstein complains\nabout were in fact used for the immediate purpose of furthering the lawsuits filed by L.M., E.W.,\nand Jane Doe. In other words, these actions all were both intended to accomplish and, in fact,\nsuccessfully \"accomplished the results for which they were intended\" -- whether it was securing\nadditional discovery or presenting a legal issue to the court handling the case or ultimately\nmaximizing the recovery of damages from Epstein on behalf of his victims. Accordingly,\nEdwards is entitled to summary judgment on any claim that he abused process for this reason as\nwell.\n13\n4. Edwards is Entitled to Summary Judgment to the Extent His Claim is Based\nOn Pursuit of Discovery Concerning Epstein's Friends Because All Such\nEfforts Were Reasonably Calculated to Lead to Relevant and Admissible\nTestimony About Epstein's Abuse of Minor Girls.\nEpstein has also alleged that Edwards improperly pursued discovery from some his close\nfriends.\nSuch discovery, Epstein claims, was improper because Edwards knew that these\nindividuals lacked any discoverable information about the sexual assault cases against Epstein.\nHere again, Edwards is entitled to summary judgment, as each of the friends of Epstein\nwere reasonably believed to possess discoverable information. The undisputed facts show the\nfollowing with regard to each of the persons raised in Epstein's complaint:\ne\nWith regard to Donald Trump, Edwards had sound legal basis for believing Mr.\nTrump had relevant and discoverable information. See Statement of Undisputed\nFacts.\n• With regard to Alan Dershowitz (Harvard Law Professor), Edwards had sound\nlegal basis for believing Mr. Dershowitz had relevant and discoverable\ninformation. See Statement of Undisputed Facts.\n• With regard to former President Bill Clinton, Edwards had sound legal basis for\nbelieving former President Clinton had relevant and discoverable information.\nSee Statement of Undisputed Facts.\n® With regard to Ramer Sony Record executive Tommy Mottola, Edwards was not\nthe attorney that noticed Mr. Mottola's deposition. See Statement of Undisputed\nFacts.\n® With regard to illusionist David Copperfield, Edwards had sound legal basis for\nbelieving Mr. Copperfield had relevant and discoverable information. See\nStatement of Undisputed Facts.\ne\nWith regard to framer New Mexico Governor Bill Richardson, Edwards had\nsound legal basis for naming Former New Mexico Governor Bill Richardson on\nhis witness list. See Statement of Undisputed Facts.\nIt is worth noting that the standard for discovery is a very liberal one. To notice someone\nfor a deposition, of course, it is not required that the person deposed actually end up producing\n14\nadmissible evidence. Otherwise, every deposition that turned out to be a false alarm would lead\nto an \"abuse of process\" claim. Moreover, the rules of discovery themselves provide that a\ndeposition need only be \"reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.\"\nFla. R. Civ. P. 1.280(b) (emphasis added).\nMoreover, the discovery that Edwards pursued has to be considered against the backdrop\nof Epstein's obstructionist tactics. As the Court is aware, in both this case and all other cases\nfiled against him, Epstein has asserted his Fifth Amendment privilege rather than answer any\nsubstantive questions. Epstein has also helped secure attorneys for his other household staff who\nassisted in the process of recruiting the minor girls, who in turn also asserted their Fifth\nAmendment rights rather than explain what happened behind closed doors in Epstein's mansion\nin West Palm Beach. See Statement of Undisputed Facts. It is against this backdrop that\nEdwards followed up on one of the only remaining lines of inquiry open to him: discovery aimed\nat Epstein's friends who might have been in a position to corroborate the fact that Epstein was\nsexually abusing young girls.\nIn the context of the sexual assault cases that Edwards had filed against Epstein, any act\nof sexual abuse had undeniable relevance to the case — even acts of abuse Epstein committed\nagainst minor girls other than L.M., E.W., or Jane Doe. Both federal and state evidence rules\nmake acts of child abuse against other girls admissible in the plaintiff s case in chief as proof of\n\"modus operandi\" or \"motive\" or \"common scheme or plan.\" See Fed. R. Evid. 415 (evidence of\nother acts of sexual abuse automatically admissible in a civil case); Fla. Stat. Ann. 90.404(b)\n(evidence of common scheme admissible); Williams v. State, 110 So.2d 654 (Fla. 1959) (other\nacts of potential sexual misconduct admissible).\n15\nA second reason exists for making discovery of Epstein's acts of abuse of other minor\ngirls admissible. Juries considering punitive damages issues are plainly entitled to consider \"the\nexistence and frequency of similar past conduct.\" TXO Production Corp. v. Alliance Resources\nCorp., 509 U.S. 443, 462 n.28 (1993). This is because the Supreme Court recognizes \"that a\nrecidivist may be punished more severely than a first offender . . . [because] repeated misconduct\nis more reprehensible than an individual instance of malfeasance.\" BMW of North America, Inc.\nv. Gore, 517 U.S. 559, 577 (1996) (supporting citations omitted). In addition, juries can consider\nother similar acts evidence as part of the deterrence calculation in awarding punitive damages,\nbecause \"evidence that a defendant has repeatedly engaged in prohibited conduct while knowing\n. . . that it was unlawful would provide relevant support for an argument that strong medicine is\nrequired to cure the defendant's disrespect for the law.\" Id. at 576-77. In the cases Edwards\nfiled against Epstein, his clients were entitled to attempt to prove that Epstein \"repeatedly\nengaged in prohibited conduct\" — i.e., because he was a predatory pedophile, he sexually\nassaulted dozens and dozens of minor girls. The discovery of Epstein's friends who might have\nhad direct or circumstantial evidence of other acts of sexual assault was accordingly entirely\nproper. Edwards is therefore entitled summary judgment to the extent his claim is based on\nefforts by Edwards to obtain discovery of Epstein's friends.\nIII. EPSTEIN'S LAWSUIT MUST BE DISMISSED BECAUSE OF HIS REFUSAL TO\nPARTICIPATE IN REASONABLE DISCOVERY.\nAs is readily apparent from the facts of this case, Epstein has filed a lawsuit but then\nrefused to allow any real discovery about the merits of his case. Instead, when asked hard\nquestions about whether he has any legitimate claim at all, Epstein has hidden behind the Fifth\n16\nAmendment. As a result, under the \"sword and shield doctrine widely recognized in Florida\ncaselaw, his suit must be dismissed.\n\"[T]he law is well settled that a plaintiff is not entitled to both his silence and his\nlawsuit.\" Boys & Girls Clubs of Marion County, Inc. v. J.A., 22 So.3d 855, 856 (Fla. 5th Dist.\nCt. App. 2009) (Griffin, J., concurring specially). Thus, \"a person may not seek affirmative\nrelief in a civil action and then invoke the fifth amendment to avoid giving discovery, using the\nfifth amendment as both a 'sword and a shield.'\" DePalma v. DePalma, 538 So.2d 1290, 1290\n(Fla. 4th Dist. Ct. App. 1989) (quoting DeLisi v. Bankers Insurance Co., 436 So.2d 1099 (Fla. 4th\nDist. Ct. App. 1983)). Put another way, \"[a] civil litigant's fifth amendment right to avoid selfincrimination\nmay be used as a shield but not a sword. This means that a plaintiff seeking\naffirmative relief in a civil action may not invoke the fifth amendment and refuse to comply with\nthe defendant's discovery requests, thereby thwarting the defendant's defenses.\" Rollins Burdick\nHunter of New York, Inc. v. Euroclassic Limited, Inc., 502 So. 2d 959 (Fla. 3rd Dist. Court App.\n1983).\nHere, Epstein is trying to do precisely what the \"well settled\" law forbids. Specifically,\nhe is trying to obtain \"affirmative relief' — i.e., forcing Edwards to pay money damages — while\nsimultaneously precluding Edwards from obtaining legitimate discovery at the heart of the\nallegations that form the basis for the relief Epstein is seeking. As recounted more fully in the\nstatement of undisputed facts, Epstein has refused to answer such basic questions about his\nlawsuit as:\n\"Specifically what are the allegations against you which you contend Mr.\nEdwards ginned up?\"\n® \"Well, which of Mr. Edwards' cases do you contend were fabricated?\"\n17\n• \"Is there anything in L.M.'s Complaint that was filed against you in September of\n2008. which you contend to be false?\"\n• \"I would like to know whether you ever had any physical contact with the person\nreferred to as Jane Doe in that [federal] complaint?\"\n• \"Did you ever have any physical contact with E.W.?\"\n• \"What is the actual value that you contend the claim of E.W. against you has?\"\nThe matters addressed in these questions are the central focus of Epstein's claims against\nEdwards. Epstein's refusal to answer these and literally every other substantive question put to\nhim in discovery has deprived Edwards of even a basic understanding of the evidence alleged to\nsupport claims against him. Moreover, by not offering any explanation of his allegations,\nEpstein is depriving Edwards of any opportunity to conduct third party discovery and\nopportunity to challenge Epstein's allegations.\nIt is the clear law that \"the chief purpose of our discovery rules is to assist the truthfinding\nfunction of our justice system and to avoid trial by surprise or ambush,\" Scipio v. State,\n928 So.2d 1138 (Fla.2006), and \"full and fair discovery is essential to these important goals,\"\nMcFadden v. State, 15 So.3d 755, 757 (Fla. 4th Dist. Ct. App. 2009). Accordingly, it is important\nfor the Court to insure \"not only compliance with the technical provisions of the discovery rules,\nbut also adherence to the purpose and spirit of those rules in both the criminal and civil context.\"\nMcFadden, 15 So.3d at 757. Epstein has repeatedly blocked \"full and fair discovery,\" requiring\ndismissal of his claim against Edwards.\n18\nIV. EDWARDS IS ENTITLED TO ADVERSE INFERENCES FROM\nEPSTEIN'S INVOCATION OF THE FIFTH AMENDMENT AND\nTHEREFORE TO SUIVIIVIARY JUDGMENT ON EPSTEIN'S CLAIM.\nEdwards is entitled to summary judgment on the claim against him for a second and\nentirely independent reason: Epstein's repeated invocations of the Fifth Amendment raise\nadverse inferences against him that leave no possibility that a reasonable factfinder could reach a\nverdict in his favor.\nIn ruling on a summary judgment motion, the court must fulfill a\n\"gatekeeping function\" and should ask whether \"a reasonable trier of fact could possibly\" reach\na verdict in favor of the plaintiff. Willingham v. City of Orlando, 929 So.2d 43, 48 (Fla. 5th Dist.\nCt. App. 2006) (emphasis added). Given all of the inferences that are to be drawn against\nEpstein, no reasonable finder of fact could conclude that Epstein was somehow the victim of\nimproper civil lawsuits filed against him. Instead, a reasonable finder of fact could only find that\nEpstein was a serial molester of children who was being held accountable through legitimate\nsuits brought by Edwards and others on behalf of the minor girls that Epstein victimized.\n\"[I]t is well-settled that the Fifth Amendment does not forbid adverse inferences against\nparties to civil actions when they refuse to testify in response to probative evidence offered\nagainst them.\" Baxter v. Pabnigiano, 425 U.S. 308, 318 (1976); accord Vasquez v. State, 777\nSo.2d 1200, 1203 (Fla. App. 2001). The reason for this rule \"is both logical and utilitarian. A\nparty may not trample upon the rights of others and then escape the consequences by invoking a\nconstitutional privilege — at least not in a civil setting.\" Fraser v. Security and Inv. Coip., 615\nSo.2d 841, 842 (Fla. 4th Dist. Ct. App. 1993). And, in the proper circumstances, \"'Silence is\noften evidence of the most persuasive character.'\" Fraser v. Security and Inv. Corp., 615 So.2d\n19\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

Our children\nalso must have children as well. And\nthis is a challenge entailing long-term\nexpenditures of energy. To account for\nthis, Cacioppo writes something about\nhuman infant dependency that is very\nclose to what both the Greek philosopher\nAristotle and the medieval Roman\nCatholic theologian Thomas Aquinas set\ndown many centuries earlier. Cacioppo\nsays,\n\nFor many species, the offspring need\nlittle or no parenting to survive and\nreproduce. Homo sapiens, however,\nare born to the longest period of\nabject dependency of any species.\nSimple reproduction, therefore, is not\nsufficient to ensure that one’s genes\nmake it into the gene pool. For an\nindividual’s genes to make it to the\ngene pool, one’s offspring must\nsurvive to reproduce. Moreover,\nsocial connections and the behaviors\nthey engender (e.g., cooperation,\naltruism, alliances) enhance the\nsurvival and reproduction of those\ninvolved, increasing inclusive\nfitness. ‘7\n\nAccording to this view, the\ntwofold interaction between inclusive\nfitness and the long period of infant\ndependency has shaped humans over the\nlong course of evolution into the social\n\nPage |35\n\nand caring creatures we are. Sociality is\na fundamental characteristic of humans,\nand, according to Cacioppo, spirituality,\nin its various forms, is an extension of\nsociality. Religion is generally,\nalthough not always, good for our\nmental and physical health - our heart,\nour blood pressure, our self-esteem, and\nour self-control - just like having good\nfriends and family or not being lonely\nare also good for our well-being. '*\nCacioppo and colleagues do not equate\nsociality and religion; they are fully\naware that religions are complex\nphenomena with many different\ndoctrinal, ethical, ritual, organizational,\npersonal, and social features that require\neither rigorous experimental or clinical\npopulation studies to sort out, even from\nthe perspective of how they affect\nhealth. Nonetheless, he seems to hold\nthat the sociality that most religions offer\nis a key reason for their efficacy in\nhuman well-being.\n\nDoes Christian Love Build on Health?\n\nBut my concern is the topic of\nChristian love and not simply\nChristianity’s contribution to mental and\nphysical health. Although Jesus is said\nto have performed miracles of health,\noffering health in this world has never\nbeen at the core of Christianity or, for\nthat matter, the other Abrahamic\nreligions of Judaism and Islam.\nBringing to maturity loving and self-\ngiving persons has been the primary\nconcern of Christianity, whether or not\nthis contributes to health and well-being.\nBut the question is, as I elaborated\nabove, does Christian love build on eros\n- that is, our strivings for health and\nother goods - or come exclusively from\nsome trans-natural source as Nygren\nbelieves the normative tradition taught?\nAnd did Christianity ever identify eros\nand our deepest motivations with\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_021281\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

Since these reports all dove-tailed, they recognized the Trust as a real underground\norganization.\n\nOnce the Trust had been established in the minds of the Western intelligence services, it\noffered them as well as exile groups the services of its network of collaborators. These services\nincluded smuggling out dissidents, stealing secret documents, and disbursing money inside Russia\nto sympathizers. Within a year, exile groups in Paris, Berlin, Vienna, and Helsinki were using the\n“Trust” to deliver arms and supplies to their partisans inside Russia. The Trust also furnished\nspies and exile leader’s fake passports which allowed them to sneak back into Russia to\nparticipate in clandestine missions. It even undertook sabotage and assassination missions paid\nfor by Western intelligence services. As they saw with their own eyes police stations blown up\nand political prisoners escape from prisons, these agents and dissidents came to further believe in\nthe power of the Trust.\n\nBy the mid-1920s, no fewer than eleven Western intelligence services had become almost\ncompletely dependent on the Trust for information about Russia. They also sent millions of\ndollars into Russia via couriers to finance its activities.\n\nBut suddenly exile leaders working in Russia under the aegis of the Trust began to vanish. Then\ntop western intelligence agents, such as Sydney Reilly and Boris Savinkov were arrested, and\ntheir networks were eliminated. Instead of the Communist regime collapsing, as the Trust had\npredicted, it consolidated its power and wiped out all the dissident groups. Finally, in 1929, the\nTrust was revealed by a defector to be a long-term false flag operation run by the Russian\nintelligence service. Even the Trust building, rather than being the cover for a subversive\nconspiracy, was the headquarters for the Russian secret police during this seven-year operation.\nThe secret police had provided the documents fed to Western intelligence, briefed the agents who\npretended to defect, published the dissident newspapers the Trust distributed, fabricated the\npassport it supplied exiles, blew up Russian buildings and staged jail breaks to make the deception\nmore credible. It also collected the money sent in by Western intelligence services, which more\nthan paid for the entire deception. Since it was running the show, it could offer those lured into\nthe trap an opportunity to work for it as double-agents. The alternative, if they refused, was to\nface a firing squad.\n\nEven after the “Trust” itself had been fully exposed, The Russian Intelligence Service continued\nto succeed with other false-flag deception, During the Cold War, for example, it set up a fake\nunderground in Poland modeled on the Trust. It was called WIN. It also set up other false flag\ngroups in Ukraine, Georgia, Lithuania, Albania, and Hungary. It also had agents masquerade as\nmembers of the security services of Israel, South Africa, Germany, France and the US to recruit\nunwitting agents. These deceptions became an integral part of the recruitments of the Russian\nintelligence services.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_020327\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

Others are struck by the insistence on transporting basic aid — food and cement — when it is no longer needed. Still others note the way the Israeli authorities portray the organizers as violent Islamists when most are middle-aged European pacifists. \n\nAlmost everything about the flotilla stuck in Greece and waiting to challenge Israel’s blockade of Gaza seems to be a parable for something else, part of an unstated effort to recast the Israeli-Palestinian narrative in extreme terms. Instead of helping to clarify what Gaza needs and how it might build a future, the saga has merely brought out the public relations demons on all sides. \n\nOstensibly the 10 or so boats, with several hundred advocates from more than a dozen countries, are trying to take goods to Gaza because of a siege imposed by Israel and Egypt to pressure Hamas, the Islamist ruler there. A year ago a similar flotilla was stopped by the Israeli Navy, and after commandos boarded and scuffles ensued, nine activists were killed. \n\nThe international outrage that followed helped force an easing of the siege. One result, largely unacknowledged by the flotilla leaders: far more goods have gone into Gaza over the past year, and while the 1.6 million people there still need many things, basic supplies are not among them. \n\nIsrael is therefore quick to say that Gaza is well provided for and does not need any flotilla. If it still wants to bring in aid, it should take it to either Israel or Egypt and it will be delivered by truck. Sea access must remain blocked to prevent weapons smuggling. \n\nThe Israeli position defies a brutal truth: last year’s flotilla made a big difference for the people of Gaza — at a terrible cost in lives — by refocusing international attention on their plight and forcing a change in Israeli policy. Today, twice as many goods enter from Israel as before. Nonetheless, Gaza remains a deeply sad and deprived place. \n\n“The focus on humanitarian aid by both flotilla organizers and the Israeli government is infuriating and misleading,” Gisha, an Israeli human rights group focused on Gaza, said in a statement. “There is no shortage of food in Gaza, but economic recovery is blocked by sweeping restrictions.” \n\nThe Exodus analogy supports a certain political and public relations strategy. In July 1947, when Britain ruled Palestine and the number of Jews allowed in was severely limited, the ship, with 4,500 Jewish refugees from Europe, tried to get through. British forces boarded it, killed three people, wounded dozens and essentially destroyed the ship as it listed in Haifa harbor. \n\nThe British ultimately sent the passengers to Hamburg. The sight of thousands of Jewish refugees shipped to Germany soon after the Holocaust sparked international outrage and sympathy for the Zionist cause, a key goal of the trip. “The Exodus showed that if the British are callous enough to send Jews back to Germany, the only ones who should be in charge of the fate of the Jews are the Jews themselves,” observed M. M. Silver, an Israeli historian and the author of “Our Exodus.” “Palestinian forces are trying to make the same point through the flotilla, that Israel has no right to control the fate of Palestinians.” \n\nSeveral months after the Exodus, the United Nations General Assembly voted for the establishment of two states in Palestine, Jewish and Arab, the key diplomatic moment in Israel’s history. The Palestinian leadership rejected that resolution, but this September plans to ask the United Nations for recognition of its statehood with the 1967 lines, a move strongly opposed by Israel. \n\nIsrael, for its part, has been campaigning against the flotilla and perhaps doing more — some of the boats have suffered sabotage. Israel says the Exodus is the wrong analogy; the flotilla is aimed at delegitimizing Israel and killing its soldiers. \n\n“The flotilla is entirely designed to attack Israel’s image around the world,” said Yuli Edelstein, minister for public diplomacy. “We know that there are representatives of different terror groups on their way to join the flotilla.” \n\nIsraeli military officials have told newspapers that some flotilla participants plan to pour sacks of sulfur on Israeli commandos and set them afire. The flotilla organizers have denied it. \n\nA government news release noted that Mr. Edelstein had participated in a simulation exercise for the flotilla in which Israeli forces were attacked. The description of the simulation indicates how the government expects the harsh information war to play out: “As the events were taking place, the media — with emphasis on the Internet, Facebook and Twitter — were flooded with mendacious reports (by private users, Hamas and others among Israel’s enemies).” \n\nMendacity has already reared its head. An Israeli actor put up a YouTube clip saying that he was a gay activist rejected by the flotilla because of his sexual orientation. The video was exposed as a fake. Israeli officials, who had promoted the clip on Twitter and Facebook, said they had been duped. But suspicions remained since the clip’s production quality was high and officials had long used the talking point that Hamas and other Islamist groups were intolerant of homosexuality. \n\nThe Turkish group I.H.H., which helps sponsor the flotillas, has ties to Hamas, and Israeli and Western concern that violence could occur if the flotilla sets sail does not seem far-fetched, despite the organizers’ vows to the contrary. \n\nSo the flotilla has virtually no support in Israel. Still, some are uncomfortable with the way the project has been criticized as an attack on Israel itself. \n\nShlomo Avineri, a historian and onetime director general of Israel’s foreign ministry, wrote in the Haaretz newspaper last week that when the flotilla is described as aimed at delegitimizing Israel, he recalls the Soviet Union’s reaction to any criticism as an assault on its right to exist. Opposition to Israeli policy is not the same as an attack on its existence, he said, and the government’s approach damages Israel. \n\nHis argument about the flotilla points to the larger dynamic: the Israeli-Palestinian dispute is increasingly disintegrating from a debate over borders and security into a battle between those claiming that Israel is a genocidal machine and those who dismiss every attack on its policy as an assault on its essence. \n\n\n\nEthan Bronner is the Jerusalem bureau chief of The New York Times. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\fArticle 2.\n\nThe Daily Beast\n\n5 Lessons of the DSK Affair\n\nBernard-Henri Lévy\n\n\n\nJuly 2, 2011 -- The Strauss-Kahn affair is not over.\n\nFor it to be over, the American system of justice must pursue its investigation and work to the very end.            \n\nIf it’s truly to be over, Dominique Strauss-Kahn must be granted not only his freedom, but—even more importantly—restoration of his honor.\n\nIn other words, “the Strauss-Kahn affair” will continue to be regarded as such as long as it hasn’t been clearly established that there never was any affair at all—and that the plaintiff, not content to have lied about this or that aspect of her past, also lied in accusing the former head of the IMF of having raped her.\n\nAnd yet, given recent revelations, we can already draw a few lessons from what will ultimately—no doubt very soon—be known as the Strauss-Kahn non-affair.\n\n1. The cannibalisation of Justice by the Sideshow.\n\nThis cannibalisation is not exclusively an American phenomenon, of course, and we have witnessed myriad examples of it in Europe and France. But it must be said that, with this affair, it has reached the heights of obscenity. The improvised press conference by the woman’s lawyer on the steps of a courthouse normally dedicated to the sober discernment of the truth was obscene. The “shame on you’s” that greeted Dominique Strauss-Kahn as he arrived for the hearing on June 6th, shouted by battalions of hotel chambermaids who knew nothing of the actual case and whose protest had been orchestrated and scripted, were obscene. And so, too, though in another manner, was the famous “perp walk” which, I’m aware, is the lot of all those charged with a crime, but which, given the identity of the accused in question, could only degenerate into globally observed torture—high punishment for a crime, which no one, at that point, knew whether or not he had committed.\n\nThis vision of Dominique Strauss-Kahn humiliated in chains, dragged lower than the gutter—this degradation of a man whose silent dignity couldn’t be touched, was not just cruel, it was pornographic. And it was at least as pornographic (because, I repeat, it’s the same thing) as attorney Kenneth Thompson’s visible glee in expounding on the state of his client’s “vagina” [sic] before the entire world.\n\n2. The Robespierrism of this judicial sideshow.\n\nWhat is Robespierrism?  It’s a word taken from the French Revolution, of course, one that describes the way those behind the terror at the time took hold of a man of flesh and blood and dehumanized him by transforming him into an abstract symbol, and, as the literal incarnation of that symbol, tailored his person to fit the skin of all they had decided to purge from society of the Ancien Régime.\n\nWell, we are compelled to observe that, regarding the Strauss-Kahn affair, America the pragmatic, that rebels against ideologies, this country of habeas corpus that de Tocqueville claimed possessed the most democratic system of justice in the world, has pushed this French Robespierrism, unfortunately, to the extremes of its craziness.\n\nIn this case, Dominique Strauss-Kahn was no longer Dominique Strauss-Kahn.  He was no longer a singular man gifted with a singular word, one whose version of the facts should have been carefully heard in order to compare it with that of his accuser. No. He was the symbol of arrogant France. He was the emblem of the world of the privileged, odiously sure of their own impunity. He was the mirror of this world of white global bankers that constitutes Wall Street—one that the other America, the Main Street of every city in the country, sees as the quintessential enemy. And, similarly, this woman was the allegory of all women who are not only battered and humiliated but also poor and immigrant—their words, silenced too long, finally expressed through hers.\n\nThe sad thing is, that’s not what justice is. Justice doesn’t oppose symbols, but human beings. Unless we succumb once more to what Condorcet—one among many of Robespierre’s victims—called the “sympathetic zeal of the supposed friends of mankind,” and what I would call the “lynching, in sympathy with minorities, by their supposed friends.”\n\n3. For in France, again, Robespierrism has always gotten on well with another -ism, apparently its opposite but in reality its twin, which is called Barrèsism. What is Barrèsism? It is a worldview that takes its name from the French nationalist writer, contemporary of the Dreyfus Affair, Maurice Barrès. And it is particularly and precisely in reference to Captain Alfred Dreyfus that he uttered the famous phrase, “That Dreyfus is guilty, I deduce not from the facts themselves, but from his race.”  The Strauss-Kahn affair is obviously unrelated to the Dreyfus affair. I must state, to be clear, that I don’t think it has much to do with this worldwide religion and delirium that is anti-Semitism.  But what I do believe is that this is the appearance of a new variation on Maurice Barrès’s phrase that has become, “That X—in this case Dominique Strauss-Kahn—is guilty, I deduce not from his race, but from his class.”\n\nAnd what I believe is that this utterance, along with the transformation (compliments of the Terror) of the “individual” Strauss-Kahn into “the suspect” delivered to the media guillotine, has been enough to fuel the fatal mechanism and make it run full throttle.\n\nIn a letter by Bill Keller, the executive editor of The New York Times, that I received May 20 and that I have no scruples about making public since publication was its purpose (it appeared in his commentary in The New York Times Magazine), he said he was “struck” and “puzzled” by the fact that “57 percent of the French public” and, in particular, “70 percent of the Socialists” seemed to embrace the cause of Dominique Strauss-Kahn, whereas “one might expect” them “to be ideologically empathetic to an African hotel maid.”\n\nI’m not saying that Keller was among those who found the powerful and white banker antipathetic. And I would say so even less since the Times ultimately provided the first elements of truth leading to the spectacular turnaround we are witnessing.\n\nBut I maintain that formulating the problem in these terms—bringing up political categories in a debate in which they are not relevant, in a word, introducing ideological considerations in an area with which they have nothing to do—is, in itself, very disturbing.\n\nAnd I maintain—as I have said and repeated here and elsewhere—that the very fact of admitting that empathies of this sort can enter into the realm of justice amounts to inventing a class justice in reverse, no less problematic nor, ultimately, less criminal than the former.\n\nIt’s no longer, as it once was, “bastard poor, the rich are always right,” but rather, “rich bastards, it’s the poor and the injured who are always, and inevitably, right.”\n\n4. Another temptation typical of our era is the sacralisation of the victim’s word.\n\nLet me make it clear. If there is a lifelong combat I have led of which I am proud, it is that which consists of giving voice to the humble and to those who have no voice. It is a combat I have fought in Bosnia, in the confines of Asia, in the forgotten wars of Africa but also, and as much or nearly so, in our officially democratic world where it took decades of struggle so that “equality of rights” wouldn’t be empty words, and so that rape, for example, would be recognized as a crime.\n\nBut giving voice to the lowly is one thing. Considering this voice as Gospel is quite another—which can be the source of new and dreadful injustices.  Yet this is exactly what has happened with his accuser’s charges.  \n\nAnd I am still asking myself how so many editorialists, so many great consciences and, by the way, so many feminists could take it as a given that the word of this woman—of whom we knew only what filtered through the incomplete language of justice—was necessarily infallible.\n\nThe truth is that we have passed from one extreme to the other. The era when the word of the System’s victims was, on principle, discredited has given way to one in which it is—also on principle—attributed all prestige.  \n\nYet I repeat: To be a victim of society is one thing, and no one doubts that the alleged victim of the supposed rape is at least the victim of a social order that pays its hotel maids peanuts and treats them like livestock.\n\nBut to be the victim of aggression is another thing entirely and of an entirely different nature. It must be established methodically, scrupulously, and with discretion, by comparing evidence, viewpoints and witness accounts and by avoiding the interference of emotion, even when justified, that may motivate one and another. This is a question of principle.\n\n5. Finally, as I immediately emphasized, there is already a victim in this case and that is the very principle, in the United States, of the presumption of innocence.  Soon there will be another, I mean another victim, should it be verified that the accuser also lied about what actually happened in this now-legendary suite at the Sofitel, and that will be Dominique Strauss-Kahn himself. But from now on, there is an established disaster, that being the destruction, in a country of which it was one of the pillars, of the sacrosanct principle that, even in an accusatory system, a man has the right to the respect of his honor and his integrity as long as his guilt has not been established.\n\nIn the case of Dominique Strauss-Kahn, this principle was flouted by the tabloids (The New York Post, The Daily News, etc.) whose competitions in humiliation transformed him, from the first moment, into a monster. He was trampled on by that part of the \"serious\" press, which, like Time magazine, with its astounding cover illustrating the “lies” and “arrogances” of the “powerful” with a photo of a pig, committed what the worst of the tabloids did not dare to.\n\nAnd he was crushed, then, by that fraction of the American judicial apparatus that, by putting Dominique Strauss-Kahn in stocks, by humiliating him before the entire world, by ruthlessly pursuing him, has probably ruined his life.  That is what I wished to say when I wrote that, after George W. Bush’s invention of the concept of “pre-emptive war,” America, under Cyrus Vance, Jr., has perhaps begun to invent the idea, scarcely less horrifying, of “pre-emptive penalty.”\n\nAnd please allow a friend of this country to repeat, here, what he has said in his own country, when media-judicial tornadoes of the same kind have swept the land: that all this calls, at the least, for serious, honest, and substantial soul-searching. \n\n\n\nBernard-Henri Lévy is one of France's most famed philosophers, a journalist, and a bestselling writer. He is considered a founder of the New Philosophy movement and is leading thinker on religious issues, genocide, and international affairs. His most recent book, Left in Dark Times: A Stand Against the New Barbarism, discusses political and cultural affairs as an ongoing battle against the inhumane.\n\n\n\fArticle 3.\n\nAl-Ahram Weekly\n\nNew paradigm in Palestine\n\nMahmoud Musa and Awni Sarrif \n\n\n\n30 June - 6 July 2011  -- All roads to a meaningful settlement of the Arab Israeli conflict are at a dead end. Nevertheless, should two states be established in historic Palestine, bloody conflict will persist. Putting aside disputes over natural resources, Israel will remain a Zionist supremacist state with a clear arsenal that can turn the entire Middle East into an inferno, and the enclaved improvised Palestinian Arab entity cannot exist without aid from the outside world. There will be democracy for the Jewish people of Israel, with second and perhaps third class citizenships for all others. \n\nThe Palestinians, as the last twenty years have shown, will be ruled under an autocratic corrupt police state. The plight of the Palestinian refugees living outside the new Palestine will continue and their right to return totally forgotten. The Jordanian regime may collapse to become the alternate home leading to civil wars between the indigenous Jordanians and the Palestinians. It is also reasonable to assume that, in order to preserve the Jewish identity of Israel, another Nakba will befall the Israeli Arabs who may be relocated to areas in the West Bank. \n\nThere can only be one solution -- one state where Palestinians and Israelis alike are equal citizens in a nation that belongs indeed to the Middle East. Three conditions must be met for the new state to take hold: dissolving the Palestinian Authority in Ramallah and the Hamas Government in Gaza, the rejection of Zionism by the Israelis, and the return of the Palestinian refugees. These can only be accomplished under the auspices of the United Nations (UN). \n\nWhereas the defunct two state solution was proposed in 1947, when the UN General Assembly passed Resolution 181 calling for dividing historic Palestine into two entities and for granting Jerusalem an international status, the reversal of this resolution by the Assembly is imperative. Although not legally binding, this resolution did grant legitimacy to the creation of the State of Israel. Ironically, since that resolution, there was no serious discussion concerning the establishment of two states in Palestine until the 1991 Madrid Conference and the signing of the Oslo Accords (Declaration of Principles on Interim Self-Government Arrangements) in Washington in 1993. Except for a few euphoric, but short-lived moments, not the slightest progress has been made towards granting the Palestinians statehood, and all attempts to establish two states have failed. \n\nWe propose that neutral member states should ask the UN General Assembly to rescind Resolution 181 and to request a new resolution for the establishment of one state in historic Palestine. Although this responsibility falls under the Security Council, the constant exercise by the US of its veto power to protect Israel against condemnations and sanctions has proven the council's ineffectiveness in dealing objectively with the Arab-Israeli conflict. \n\nAt the General Assembly, each state has an equal voting right, thus lending legitimacy to passed resolutions. In its deliberations, the Assembly should also address international law and human rights violations committed by Israel, the PA, and neighbouring states against the Palestinian people, and set a course for a new beginning in the Middle East through major shifts in the paradigms that have crippled the region for decades. \n\nA resolution for establishing one democratic state in historic Palestine will include as citizens all those who live there and all Palestinians in the Diaspora, reaffirming Palestinian refugees right to return, and acknowledging the special place that Palestine is for world Jewry. Such a resolution is supported by four facts: All attempts to establish two states have ended in failure; the Jewish and Palestinian populations are too intertwined to separate except forcibly which would constitute apartheid; the physical geography and natural resources such as water and natural gas in coastal waters make division a source of perpetual tension; it is imperative to eliminate the current legitimacy given to Israel's racist colonial system and to establish a just political culture for all.\n\nThe resolution's implementation would be the responsibility of the UN and Israel/Palestine, Jordan, Syria, Lebanon and Egypt. To succeed, representatives of world powers may have to serve as even-handed observers.\n\nThe international focus on the Goldstone Report elaborating Israel's alleged crimes in Gaza, and on its assault on the humanitarian aid flotilla uncover only the tip of the iceberg of Israel's violations of international law. The UN is within its rights to sanction Israel for its defiance of international laws and norms. However, although Israel is the primary offender, Lebanon (denying Palestinians minimum civilian rights), Jordan (withdrawing citizenship without due process of the law), and the PA (an autocratic police- state), should all be held accountable for gross human rights violations against the Palestinians. \n\nWhile a new course should be set based on reconciliation and forgiveness, Israeli and Arab individuals charged with such war crimes and human rights violations must be prosecuted. The General Assembly should, therefore, establish an International Criminal Tribunal as a \"subsidiary organ\" under Article 22 of the UN Charter for this very purpose. \n\nThe proposed shift in the paradigms regarding the Palestinian/Israeli conflict, once implemented will contribute to three UN goals: peace and security of the West Asian/North African region as the new state relinquishes occupied Lebanese and Syrian territories and dismantles it nuclear arsenal; cultural, political, and economic development of the region; and equal rights of all people living on that land.\n\nThe new state will be diverse -- an amalgam of different nationalities and faiths, all with equal rights and opportunities. To the Abrahamic faiths, historic Palestine is the Holy Land. The majority of the Palestinians see themselves as Arabs; as such, the new state should have a special status in a more meaningful Arab League. The nationalistic feelings of the Jewish population that link them to fellow Jews worldwide must be recognised and upheld. The Jewish population will, however, have to reject Zionism, a racist and apartheid ideology based on 19th century European colonialist thinking which preyed on the Jewish national feelings long before the Palestinians became its victims. \n\nThe new state will bring fundamental changes in governance to the region. Democracy based on equal opportunities will begin to take hold with economic and military unions of the independent states of the region. An EU-like union of the new state, Syria, Jordan and Lebanon will enhance peace and reconciliation and will be a nucleus for a larger regional union.\n\nThere are numerous challenges ahead. They range from developing trust to rebuilding the infrastructure, the judicial, educational and social institutions; from disposing of the nuclear arsenal to dealing with the issues of confiscated lands, demolished homes and erased towns and villages.

In this scenario, China replaces the US and the global hegemonic power sooner or later. As we study these America-is-finished-and-China-rules-the-world forecasts, it is important to recall that not so long ago many of the same pundits and futurologists were anticipating that globalisation and the Internet would lead to the collapse of the nation-state and the end of the business cycle, or that the US would dominate a unipolar international system and bring about the triumph of democracy and free markets worldwide.\n\nThat many of the same experts who were celebrating US triumphalism in the aftermath of the fall of the Berlin Wall and the First Gulf War have now been transformed into the prophets of American gloom and doom, should encourage us to embrace a certain sense of scepticism about the notion that China and the rest of the Rest are about to take charge and that Washington will turn out to be nothing more than a tourist attraction for Chinese and Indian tourists in the coming years.\n\nEven if we set aside indicators such as gross national income per capita (US$46,300 in the US; US$3,650 in China) or military spending (US$687.105 billion in the US; US$114.300 billion in China) that make it clear that the combined economic (G-8 and other industrial nations) and military power of the West overwhelms that of the Rest, the reality is that the Rest - occasionally being referred to as the South - remains an amorphous amalgam of nation-states and economies that have very little in common aside from some hostility - which is receding - towards past European colonialism and American hegemonism.\n\nThat Russia is both a member of the exclusive western club of the G-8 and of the BRIC grouping is just one example of the complex global reality in which governments like Russia, or for that matter China, Turkey or Brazil, find US power to be appealing while at the same time also trying to keep it at bay. Hence, the states and economies which belong to the elusive Rest are seeking to penetrate the markets of the US and the West and attract their investors, while also hoping to reform global rules and institutions in a way that would reflect their growing power.\n\nBut as Mexico failed in its attempt to win support from the South for its candidate for leading the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the long-term interests of China or India may lead them to support the current status quo in the institution. In fact, the G-20 that has been touted as the new global grouping for projecting the rising power of the Rest, has yet to demonstrate its effectiveness in charting a new direction for the global economy.\n\nMoreover, notwithstanding their occasional resort to anti-American rhetoric, China and Russia which are leading members of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation are each probably more worried over the threat that the other poses to its security interests than the US challenge.\n\nTurkey may be attempting to reassert its influence in the Middle East by defying US pressure. But it remains a loyal member of Nato and continues to press for membership in the EU. In fact, notwithstanding Turkey's regional ambitions, it has proved to be ineffective in trying to bring to an end the political upheaval and violence in neighbouring Syria. At the same time, despite its lessening influence in the Middle East, the US and its Nato and EU partners continue to play an active role in trying to provide support to its allies and bring some stability to the Middle East.\n\nAnd while Asean members are strengthening their economic ties with the rising Chinese giant - as are Japan, South Korea, Australia and India - they also support continuing strong US military and economic presence in East Asia as part of an effort to counter-balance Chinese efforts to establish its dominant position in the region.\n\nIn a way, even as emerging markets are gaining more economic clout and the international system is becoming multipolar, it is not clear that that is creating the conditions for the West versus the Rest confrontation or that the US or the EU is being marginalised. In the new global economy and international system with its many centres of power, interlocking trade and investment ties, and shifting balances of power, a wise and effective leadership coming out of Washington could help actually turn the US once again into a central and indispensable power.\n\n\n\nLeon T.

When Chinese Defense Minister General Liang Guanglie was telling the Shangri-la Dialogue on June 3 in Singapore that \"China is committed to maintaining peace and stability in the South China Sea\" and that \"China stood by\" the DOC, news media were reporting that on May 26 a Vietnamese survey ship operating on its claimed continental shelf had its seismic cables cut by a Chinese patrol boat.\n\nShortly after that event China sent two vice chairmen of the Central Military Commission to Southeast Asia to try to reassure other ASEAN claimants. But a second such incident occurred on June 9 — only two weeks later. Earlier, on March 4, the Philippines protested an incident on the Reed Bank in which two Chinese patrol boats allegedly threatened to ram a Philippine survey ship.\n\nThen on the eve of Gen. Liang's visit to Manila, Chinese fighter jets allegedly harassed members of the Armed Forces of the Philippines near disputed islands in the South China Sea.\n\nChina responded to frenetic protests from Vietnam and the Philippines that any exploration in the Spratly area without its consent is a violation of its jurisdiction and sovereignty. This real time link between its stark and sweeping position and its enforcement has sent a chill down the spines of other ASEAN claimant and drawn U.S. attention. These disputes and even such incidents are certainly not new but why are they occurring now, and why is China sending very mixed signals?\n\nThis was supposed to be a period of negotiations to transform the DOC into an official enforceable code. Needless to say, this effort may now be moribund.\n\nDespite China's rhetoric, ASEAN nations are genuinely alarmed and are looking to the United States for succor and support. The U.S. — having confronted China and injected itself into the issue via U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's speech at the ARF Foreign Minister's meeting in Hanoi in July 2010 — is only too happy to help — at least verbally and with signals that militaries understand.\n\nThe great irony is that none of this was necessary for China. Its problem with the U.S., or vice versa, concerns the intelligence-gathering activities of U.S. military vessels and aircraft — the EP-3, the Impeccable, the Victorious, the Bowditch in what it claims is its waters — not conflicting claims to islands or ocean space. These can only be linked in one worst scenario: that China has decided that it disagrees with portions of the U.N. Law of the Sea Treaty that it ratified and with international law that Western powers developed and have imposed on China while it was weak and that it now is set on revamping the international system.\n\nIn other words China is indeed serious about its nine-dashed line claim to all features, waters and resources of the South China Sea and it alone will decide the passage regime to be imposed therein.\n\nThis is radical and could lead to war.Otherwise, China could claim most of what it wants by using existing international law and the Law of the Sea Treaty. It could claim the features and, for legal islands, a continental shelf and 200 nautical mile exclusive economic zone for each. Of course it would have to negotiate boundaries with the other claimants.\n\nBut that is the present situation anyway and China's legal position is very weak. The area claimed would be almost the same as that within the nine-dashed line and the argument would be legitimate — supported by the convention.\n\nRegarding the navigational issues with the U.S., the U.S. has not ratified the convention and has little legitimacy in arguing it or its interpretation thereof. The U.S. would be widely seen as a \"bully\" if it tried to force its interpretation on the world.\n\nThe puzzle is that China has excellent experts on Law of the Sea who are aware of this opportunity and yet China seems to be eschewing this option.\n\nPerhaps U.S. strategy and tactics have pushed a portion of China's military leadership \"over the edge.\" Maybe they have concluded from what they perceive as the U.S. \"containment\" policy and the constant and active probing by high-tech spy vessels and planes that war is inevitable. In this scenario China feels it must defend its exposed underbelly and push its defense \"zone\" as far south and seaward as possible.\n\nOf course, this is anathema to the U.S., particularly its navy. In this case, the DOC or even a convention will be of little utility. Let us hope that the real explanation is more benign. One possibility is confusion and lack of coordination between high policy officials in foreign affairs and the military, particularly the PLA Navy. But this could also mean that China's foreign policy is in flux or disarray on this issue and that the PLA Navy has emerged as a trendsetter and spokesperson thereon.\n\nRemember that just as U.S. Secretary of Defense Robert Gates arrived in January on his historic visit to China, its military tested a stealth fighter and the civilian leadership appeared to have been caught unawares.\n\nIf the military is on occasion acting independently of the civilian leadership, this could explain the seeming dichotomy between Chinese officials' words and PLA Navy actions. But this would indeed be worrying.\n\nIn any event the situation looks likely to get worse before it gets better. More surveys and exploratory drilling are planned in areas claimed by China. And Vietnam has conducted an offshore live-fire drill and has called for international — including U.S. — help to resolve the issues. Rare anti-China protests have broken out in Hanoi and Manila. At this point all one can say is hold on to your hat.\n\n\n\nMark Valencia, a former senior fellow with the East-West Center, is a maritime policy analyst.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\fArticle 6.\n\nScientific American\n\nHow the Brain Understands Food and Appetite [Excerpt] \n\nDavid Linden  \n\n\n\nEditor's Note: The following is an excerpt from a chapter in the book Compass of Pleasure: How Our Brains Make Fatty Foods, Orgasm, Exercise, Marijuana, Generosity, Vodka, Learning, and Gambling Feel So Good by David Linden. Copyright (c) 2001 by David Linden. \n\n\nJuly 2, 2011  -- In studies where the food intake and energy expenditure of subjects are carefully monitored over a period of weeks to months (which tends to average out day-to-day fluctuations) a remarkable balance between calories consumed and calories burned was observed. When various mammals, from mice to monkeys, are either overfed or starved for a few weeks, their weight soon returns to normal levels when free access to food is resumed. Crucially, our mammalian bodies seem to be able to regulate feeding based on the amount of energy available in the food we consume, not just on the volume of that food. One example of many: When groups of rats were fed nutrient solutions of varying concentrations, they adjusted the volume consumed to achieve a constant inflow of calories. It's a lot like the thermostat in your house: When its thermometer registers a drop in temperature, it sends a signal to the heater to warm the house until the desired set point is reached. \nThese observations suggest that the brain must receive signals from the body that indicate its weight and that the brain makes use of the signals to modulate appetite and energy expenditure in order to maintain an individual's weight within a fairly narrow range. The signals are received in a structure at the base of the brain called the hypothalamus. The hypothalamus is involved in the control of many basic, subconscious drives and reflexes including sex, feeding, aggression, drinking, and regulation of body temperature. When rats received lesions in a particular subregion of the hypothalamus called the ventromedial area, they became obese. They behaved as if they were starving and compensated with an increase in food intake and a decrease in energy expenditure. Conversely, when a different part of the hypothalamus, called the lateral area, was destroyed, the rats behaved as if they had been overfed. They reduced food intake and increased energy use and thereby became dangerously lean. This is not just a rat trick: These experiments have been replicated in a wide variety of mammals, and humans who sustain damage to the ventromedial hypothalamus (usually from a tumor of the adjacent pituitary gland) will also increase their food intake and become obese. \nThis model raises one obvious question: How does your hypothalamus know how much you weigh? Let's step back and play God for a moment. If you wanted to build this system, how would you do it? By measuring blood glucose? Fat deposits? Core body temperature? Pressure on the soles of the feet? \nThis all remained a mystery until 1994, when Jeffrey Friedman and his colleagues at Rockefeller University reported their observations of two strains of mutant mouse, one called obese and the other called db. (These mutations were not created by scientists using genetic tricks but arose spontaneously in a breeding colony.) Both strains of mice were extremely fat, a trait that was passed on to their offspring in a simple, dominant pattern of inheritance, like eye color. This suggested that obesity in both obese and db mouse strains resulted from a mutation in a single gene in each case. Friedman's group was able to track down the mutation in the obese mice and found that it blocked production of a particular protein hormone, which they named leptin. The leptin protein is only secreted by fat cells. When similar analysis was performed on the db mice, it was found that the disrupted db gene was responsible for encoding a protein that functions as a leptin receptor: When it binds circulating leptin at the cell surface, it sets in motion a biochemical cascade inside the cell. Most provocatively, the leptin receptor is expressed strongly on neurons in those areas of the hypothalamus that cause obesity or leanness when destroyed.\nSo with Friedman's key findings we now have a reasonable hypothesis for how the hypothalamus can sense body weight and use that information to maintain it within a narrow range. When weight is gained, the amount of body fat increases, and since fat cells secrete leptin in proportion to their mass, leptin levels will consequently rise. Leptin circulates in the blood and crosses into the brain, where it is sensed by leptin receptors expressed on neurons in the hypothalamus. Activation of those neurons by leptin suppresses appetite and increases energy expenditure. When weight is lost, the system works in the opposite direction: Less fat means reduced levels of circulating leptin, increased appetite, and reduced energy expenditure. \nSo far, the evidence that supports this hypothesis is quite promising. Leptin levels in the blood do indeed increase with weight gain and decrease with weight loss. Injections of leptin in obese mutant mice cause them to reduce food intake and lose weight (and these injections work even if tiny doses are delivered directly to the hypothalamus). Injections of leptin in db mutant mice have no effect, because there are no leptin receptors in the hypothalamus for the exogenous leptin to activate. \nOf those people who are morbidly obese, less than 1 percent harbor DNA mutations that disrupt the function of the leptin gene—a low rate of incidence that is not surprising, as leptin-deficient humans and mice are both in fertile, so these mutations do not pass readily to subsequent generations. \n\nDavid J.

Helicoptered into the Sinai just hours\nearlier, the paratroopers had been sent to the Chinese Farm shortly before\nmidnight. As I would soon learn, they had no more idea than I did about what\nthey were about to face. They were told they were going in simply to clear out\nbands of “tank-hunters”. They weren ’t told of repeated attempts by some of\nArik’s top tank, paratroop and reconnaissance units to take the farm over the\nprevious 36 hours — attacks which had not only failed, but had cost dozens of\ntanks and hundreds of men. Without artillery, armor or air support, they\nimmediately came under rifle, machine-gun, mortar and heavy artillery fire.\n\nOur job was to get them out. Ordering my men to get ready for our first\ncombat mission of the war, I found myself face-to-face with a distraught and\ndetermined friend from military intelligence.

But before joining military intelligence,\nhe’d been a company commander in Battalion 890. Hearing that we were going\nto rescue his old unit, he insisted on joining me on the lead tank. I tried several\ntimes to refuse, but he said I had no moral authority to stash him in an APC\nwhen we were going in to rescue his friends and comrades. Aware that each\nwasted minute might cost more of the paratroopers’ lives, I relented. I told\nYishai he’d be sitting across from me on the turret, right above Yasha Kedmi,\nanother friend who, having served under me in my first tank company in the\nWar of Attrition, had asked to join back at Julis. Yasha was our loader and\nradio-operator. He got Yishai a machine gun, extra magazines for his Uzi and a\nbox of grenades.\n\nWe moved out through wave-like dunes in total darkness. After the first few\nmiles, the terrain leveled out a bit. Still, the sand was deep and the going slow.\nWhen we got within a couple of miles of where I assumed Yitzhik and his men\nwould be, I radioed him. His voice was chilling. ““They’re very close to us,\nshooting,” he said. “I’ve got many wounded.

Objective: an alliance between\nright-wing leaders, from Salvini to Orban in view of the 2019 elections\n\nNEW YORK. The invasion of Europe has begun. Steve Bannon, 65, the American far-right guru who was\nDonald Trump’s right-hand man in the White House — but let go last summer following the racist\nviolence in Charlottesville — is preparing to march on Brussels. Launching, he told the Daily Beast\nhimself, a new non-profit foundation called The Movement, (Il Movimento), right in the heart of Europe\nand its institutions. Through which he hopes to coordinate the populist right in view of the European\nelections which will be held in spring 2019.\n\nObjective: to compete with George Soros, the American billionaire of Hungarian origin, benefactor of the\nDemocratic party, who since 1984 with his Open Society has spent at least $32 billion in support of\nNGOs dealing with human rights. And for this he became the bogeyman of the populist right, accused of\nplots of all kinds: including that of wanting to replace Italians with immigrants in order to have labour at\nlow cost. A mantra repeated in the past on Twitter also by the current Minister of the Interior Matteo\nSalvini.\n\nThe ambition of Steve Bannon, former director of the alt-right American site Breitbart — which in the\nEuropean campaign preceded him since the platform had already opened bureaux in London and Rome\n— is therefore to become the coordinator of the one great “populist international” of which he has long\nsince been dreaming.\n\nThe Movement, in fact, intends to function as an extreme right-wing think tank: a source of strategic\nadvice to channel the not-so-politically structured discontent of the most extreme European movements.\nAnalysing data and giving strategic advice. But also by raising funds and channeling funding.\n\nThe aim is to create a populist alliance, a sort of “super group” that if victorious can conquer up to a third\nof the European Parliament in the elections next May.\n\nIndeed — putting the common policy of the Old Continent in the hands of Bannon and his own. The\nAmerican strategist is very attached to the Freedom Caucus — the extreme right of the US Congress —\nand in 2014 he was at the top of the Cambridge Analytica company, which in 2016 used data stolen from\nFacebook to try to influence the presidential election from which Donald Trump emerged victor. It is not\na mystery that for a long time he courts nationalists of the right from East to West. And he has already\nmet, among others, the Hungarian Orban, the French Marine Le Pen and the former leader of the British\nseparatists Nigel Farage. The latter reappeared, coincidentally, on Friday in Pennsylvania, USA, to a\nfundraiser in favor of the Republican congressman Lou Barletta. Without forgetting the Italians of Lega\nand 5 stars.

He is a professor of\nsoftware engineering at Carnegie Mellon University.\n\nIt has taken me a while to figure out how to undo about 25 years\nof teaching experience that was standing in front of a room and\ntalking, but I really like it.

Once a teacher gets\nthe idea that his job is not telling but helping, he gets into the swing\nof it fairly easily. Training teachers to teach in the kinds of SCCs we\npropose for high school is more an issue of familiarizing them with\nthe content, which will differ considerably from what they have been\nteaching.

This\nreveals just how much today’s 1.25 billion Indians, who are digitally\nhitched to the global flow of ideas, have adopted new views of their\ncapacity for progress — not only for India but for themselves.\n\nDuring his campaign, Modi tapped into this rising aspiration for India to\nemulate the best in other countries. One in eight voters went to the polls\nfor the first time, a sign of the fact that two-thirds of the population is\nunder 35.

Voter turnout was a record 66 percent. And the\nelectoral results cut across the old divides of caste, rural vs urban, old vs.\nyoung, poor vs. middle-class. On those measures alone, India has\nsurpassed China, which is not even allowed to have elections, and the\npolitical disunity in Europe and America.\n\nThe BJP’s election sweep was achieved in part out of public frustration\nwith the long-ruling Congress party.

Such a\nfeat was achieved only once before, in 1984, after the assassination of\nIndira Gandhi boosted the Congress party in an election.\n\nAs prime minister, Modi must not forget he is riding an awakening of\nIndian expectations as much as leading them.

Source: White House Office of Management and Budget.\na\nPS sacs rpeo com USA Inc. | Summary\n\nTake a step back, and imagine what the founding fathers would think if they saw how our\ncountry’s finances have changed. From 1790 to 1930, government spending on average\naccounted for just 3% of American GDP. Today, government spending absorbs closer to 24% of\nGDP.\n\nIt’s likely that they would be even more surprised by the debt we have taken on to pay for this\nexpansion. As a percentage of GDP, the federal government’s public debt has doubled over the\nlast 30 years, to 53% of GDP. This figure does not include claims on future resources from\nunderfunded entitlements and potential liabilities from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the\nGovernment Sponsored Enterprises (GSEs). If it did include these claims, gross federal debt\naccounted for 94% of GDP in 2010. The public debt to GDP ratio is likely to triple to 146% over\nthe next 20 years, per CBO. The main reason is entitlement expense. Since 1970, these costs\nhave grown 5.5 times faster than GDP, while revenues have lagged, especially corporate tax\nrevenues. By 2037, cumulative deficits from Social Security could add another $11.6 trillion to\nthe public debt.\n\nThe problem gets worse. Even as USA Inc.’s debt has been rising for decades, plunging interest\nrates have kept the cost of supporting it relatively steady. Last year’s interest bill would have\nbeen 155% (or $290 billion) higher if rates had been at their 30-year average of 6% (vs. 2% in\n2010). As debt levels rise and interest rates normalize, net interest payments could grow 20% or\nmore annually. Below-average debt maturities in recent years have also kept the Treasury’s\nborrowing costs down, but this trend, too, will drive up interest payments once interest rates rise.\n\nCB www.kpcb.com USA Inc. — xii\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_020835\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

If there was going to be an Israel — if\nthere was going to be a Mishmar Hasharon — we had to win and the Arabs had\nto lose. At first, even the fact our kibbutz had been given a share of the land of\nWadi Khawaret seemed just another product of the war. After all, Ben-Gurion\nhad accepted the plan for two states. The Arabs had said no, deciding to attack\nus instead. Someone had to farm the land.

The Palestinians\nwere not the only refugees. More than 600,000 Jews fled into Israel from Arab\ncountries where they had lived for generations. More than 100,000 arrived from\nIraq, and several hundred thousand from Morocco, Tunisia and Algeria in north\nAfrica. Immediately after the war, about 50,000 were airlifted out of Yemen,\nwhere they had endured violent attacks ever since the UN partition vote.\n\nThe reality that greeted the Yemenis in Israel was more complex. Most were\ninitially settled in tented transit camps. I’m not sure how several dozen Yemeni\nfamilies made their way to Wadi Khawaret, but it made sense for them to move\ninto the village’s vacant homes. It was empty except for several deserted\nbuildings which we and other kibbutzim began using for storage and, later, for\nour transport co-operative. Yet a few nights after the Yemenis moved in, a\nposse of young men, including some from Mishmar Hasharon, descended on\nthem and, armed with clubs and wooden staves, drove them away.\n\nI was shocked. I’d seen the photos in Davar le Yeladim celebrating the\nairlift, with the Yemenis kissing the airport tarmac in relief, gratitude and joy at\nfinding refuge in the new Israeli state. Now, for the “crime” of moving into a\nrow of empty buildings in search of a decent place to live, they’d been beaten\nup and chased away. By us. I realized Wadi Khawaret no longer belonged to the\nArabs. But, surely, our kibbutz had no more right to the buildings than Jews\nwho had fled from Yemen and needed them a lot more than we did. For days, I\ntried to discover who had joined the vigilante attack. Though everyone seemed\nto know what had happened, no one talked about it.

I do not work alone, I have a team whom I lead and encourage and on whom I rely. Within each human\nbeing there is an inexhaustible source of potential, but there is no human being with unlimited capacity. What is\nimportant is to know your capacities -- and how you should use them.\n\nFor fun, I spend my time with my family at the beach or in the desert. I love to read. I ride horses. My love for\nhorses is indescribably enormous; it is part of20my soul and history.\nThe National Abu Dhabi Media Company - Matt Slater\n\nHow are the Federal Government and the Government of Dubai cooperating to re-tool\nthe development model to address what many economists predict is a permanent\nreduction in credit available from international capital markets\n\nWhether the available global credit declines or increases, the model of our economy is stable and is developing\nwithin the framework that we created earlier. Dubai’s needs for credit tend to decline and the government’s\nloans, which are modest, compared to the size of the economy, all concern investment in infrastructure, not\ncurrent expenditures or operational budgets. The majority of our infrastructure projects are of a long-term\nproductive nature, such as the Dubai Metro, the expansion of the power generation station, and so on. With\nregard to the loans of state-owned companies -- they are purely commercial in nature, and their calculations are\nbased on the cost of the loan and the return on investment. The global financial crisis has affected the liquidity\nof the companies, and we believe that it is only a temporary impact. We have sufficient means to provide the\nnecessary liquidity for these companies. I would like to stress that Dubai's economy is part of the UAE\neconomy, and we cannot in any way deal with the situation as an independent entity. I will give you one\nexample: We say Abu Dhabi banks, Dubai banks and Sharjah banks. These terms relate to the location of the\nheadquarters only, since all banks operate in all the seven Emirates, and are subject to fiscal and monetary\npolicy overseen by one body, and one central bank. In any case, credit is always available, and even a few\nmonths after the financial crisis, it had been available. Of course, this does not mean that all the available credit\nis desirable. This issue is a subject to extensive studies and discussions and to cost-benefit equations.\n\nBy Al-Sharq al-Awsat Daily\n\nThe question of population demography has been a source of worry to the UAE\nnationals, as it must certainly worry Your Highness. You have announced some\ninitiatives in this regard, uncovering a few of them. Could you tell us more about these\ninitiatives?\n\nThis question is important because of its ramifications and interconnection of its economic, social, and cultural\ndimensions. His Highness the President of the UAE has defined our approach toward this question. He has said\nthat we have a positive outlook toward the demographic structure, showing the ability of our people and state to\nmix this human quantity and variety in a human framework, capable of creating a model highlighting the power\nof human interaction in the process of building and raising our state to assume an advanced position on the level\nof civilization and development. Such a model will help us in gaining the respect and appreciation of local and\nin ternational organizations for our human and civilized treatment of all residents in our country, providing\nincentives for them to take active part in the development process of the UAE.\n\nThis vision, as defined by His Highness the President, does not remove from our sight the necessity of\npreserving our national identity. This was the starting point which led to the formation of a high-level\ncommittee, headed by the minister of interior, to deal with the question of demographic structure. We highly\nappreciate the work of this committee, which drew out a number of initiatives to deal with this question and\ntake active measures in this connection. We are preparing other measures and decisions within our declared and\ntransparent policy for dealing with the question of demographic structure in a civilized manner, without\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_024939\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

It was an urgent message\nfrom Lod Airport, now renamed in honor of David Ben-Gurion, who passed\naway after the 1973 war. Radio contact had been lost with Air France Flight 139\nfrom Tel Aviv to Paris, shortly after a stopover in Athens.\n\nWe couldn’t know for sure what had gone wrong. Maybe a mechanical\nmalfunction, a glitch in the electronics, a crash. Or a hijack. But we did know\nthere were roughly 300 passengers and a dozen crew on board. Many of the\npassengers were Israelis, and others were Jews from abroad. Ever since the\nSabena hijacking four years earlier, whenever a civilian airliner was thought to\nbe under attack within three hours of Israel, step-one in our response had been\nautomatic. Sayeret Matkal was ordered to the airport.\n\nBecause I’d commanded the Sabena operation — the first, and still the only,\ntime we had attacked and freed a hijacked plane — it was probably inevitable I\nwould take some part in figuring out how, or whether, to intervene if the Air\nFrance plane turned out to have been hijacked. But my pivotal role, as the crisis\nintensified, was down to a combination of factors: my broader experience as\nsayeret commander, the fact that I now worked in the kirya, just one floor up\nfrom the chief of staff, and, as so often, pure chance.\n\nAs the sayeret assembled at the airport, its current commander —Yoni\nNetanyahu, my former deputy — was hundreds of miles away in the Sinai,\npreparing for an operation across the canal. So it was Mookie Betzer, now\nYoni’s deputy, who began briefing the men for a possible hostage rescue in case\nthe jet returned to Israel. At the kirya, we were also without our commander:\nMotta was in the Negev observing a major military exercise. So it was his\ndeputy — the head of the operations branch, Kuti Adam — who buzzed me on the\nintercom at two in the afternoon and summoned me to his office.\n\nBy now, we knew the plane had been hijacked, but that it wasn’t heading\nback to Israel. The terrorists had renamed it “Arafat” and it was on its way to\nLibya. I took the stairs down to Kuti’s office, two floors below mine, and he\nimmediately handed me a large, black-and-white aerial photo. It showed the\ninternational airport in Benina, just outside Benghazi on the eastern edge of\nLibya. “Can we do anything, Ehud?” he asked me. I didn’t say no outright. But\nI told him that even if we had a treasure trove of intelligence about Benina —\n\n165\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_011636\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

As demonstrated by the work of Kurt Gray, Andres Martinez, and others, labeling someone a\npsychopath, autistic, or schizophrenic effectively pigeon holes the individual into a class of individuals\nwith less than fully human qualities. This is a good thing when it focuses us on protection, intervention\nand rehabilitation. It is a bad thing when it allows us to morally disengage because those lacking the full\ncompliment of qualities associated with agency and experience are less morally worthy. Humanness\ndrives our moral concerns and our sense of others’ moral worth. When we lower our sense of another’s\nvalue, we are willing to violate our sense of the sacred, engaging in trade-offs that are normally taboo.\nExperiments by the American psychologists Philip Tetlock and Jonathan Haidt help us see what\nis sacred by asking individuals what they would pay to do something sacrilegious. If something is sacred,\nof great moral worth either personally or to your group, could you be paid off by a wealthy investor to\ngive up the object or engage in an act against it? For each of the acts below, think about your payoff\npoint in dollars from $0 (for free) to $1million, including the option of saying that you would never do it\nfor any amount of money. Keep in mind that if you choose to carry out an act and receive payment you\n\nwill not suffer any consequences:\n\n* Kick a dog in the head, hard.\n\n* Sign a secret but binding pledge to hire only people of your race into your company\n* Burn your country’s flag in private\n\n* Throw a rotten tomato at a political leader that you dislike.\n\n* Get a one pint transfusion of disease-free, compatible blood from a convicted child molester.\n\nIf you are like the subjects in these experiments, the mere process of considering a payoff, even\nfor a short period of time, will have turned your stomach into knots and triggered a deep sense of disgust.\nThis is because violating the sacred is akin to violating our sense of humanness. It is playing with the\ndevil, accepting a Faustian offer of money to strip something of its moral worth. As Haidt notes, even\nthough it is sacrilege to accept payment across different moral concerns, including avoiding harm, acting\nfairly, and respecting authority, different experiences can modulate the aversion we feel when we imagine\nsuch transgressions. Women typically demand more money for each of these acts than men, and more\noften reject them as taboo. Those who lean toward the conservative end of the political spectrum either\nask for more money or consider the act taboo when compared to liberals, and this was especially the case\nfor questions focused on acting against an in-group (race), an authority figure (political leader), or ones\n\npurity (blood transfusion).

Like most, I model\ninheritance as zero and physical capital acquisition as beginning after age of\nindependence A. That can be modeled as age 20. As human depreciation begins then\nat zero, if depreciation theory is right, gross realized work (pay) simplifies at first to\nrealized work. This takes up all the new worker's time and attention, yet\n\nsimultaneously enables subliminal self-invested work in job experience.\n\nIt seems reasonable to model pay at job entry as equal to the new worker's\nmaintenance consumption, on the reasoning that independence means reaching the\nability to earn it. Thus nothing is left for investment in physical capital at first. But\nthe quick buildup of job experience soon means pay left for investment. As I model\n\nno pay plowback, that means physical capital acquisition.\n\nHuman depreciation rises slowly while the self-invested work of job experience\ndiminishes, so that overall growth in human capital peaks and then declines.\nPhysical capital owned does the same as we acquire it and then spend it on the\nyoung. Young arrive, on average, as a cohort reaches age 28.5 (my estimate of the\ngeneration length). The cohort of adults begins divesting its capital of both factors in\n\nnurture and schooling received by the young as invested consumption.\n\nThe young reach independence on average when the adult cohort reaches age 57 (2\nx 28.5). Some young will have been born after parental age 28.5, and will continue to\nreceive parental investment over the eight years remaining between age 57 and\nretirement modeled at age 65. But my model cannot account confidently for this\neight year gap on the whole, or for the retirement period following, which runs\ntwice as long. My hypothesis is that retirees are effectively employees hired by\nproductives to help take care of the kids, while the eight-year gap might show a\nhuman capital reserve against nasty surprises.\n\nAPPENDIX A: The Argument in Notation 3/7/16 24\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_011150\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

China shared (or exchanged) the fruits of its espionage on\nnuclear warhead design with North Korea, Pakistan, Iran and Russia.\n\nDespite its formidable intelligence coups in the US, the Chinese intelligence service managed to\nremain among the most elusive of America’s intelligence adversaries. Its espionage organizations\nare hidden behind layers of bureaucracy in the Ministry of State Security, Chinese Communist\nparty structures, and the second, third and fourth department of the General Staff of the People’s\nLiberation Army. Much of its cyber espionage units are concealed on the campuses of its\nuniversities. Its hierarchy, or order of battle, is also obscure. Few traces have been uncovered of\nany conventional espionage networks in the United States and no major Chinese spy has ever\nbeen arrested. Part of the reason that Chinese espionage has proved so elusive to the eyes of\nwestern counter-intelligence, was that, unlike Russia, it did not ordinarily rely on intelligence\nofficers in its embassies to recruit penetration agents to steal secrets. It did not even have an\nembassy in the United States during most of the Cold War. Instead, its services specialize it\nassembly mosaics of intelligence assembled from a wide variety of sources including non-classified\ndocuments, returning graduate students, scientific conferences, exchanges with allies, and a vast\noperation of hacking into computers, or cyber- espionage.\n\nCyber-espionage is indeed a vast enterprise in China. Graduating over 150,000 computer science\nengineers, it had no shortage of personnel. It also had developed the cyber tool kit to gain access to the\ncomputer networks of US government contractors and consultants in the private sector and government\nagencies, planting “sleeper” bugs in net-worked computers. Like human “sleeper” agents, these hidden\nprograms can be activated when needed for operational purposes. Chinese controllers can retrieve emails,\ndocuments and turn on the cameras and microphones of personal computers, tablets and smart phones. By\n2007, Paul Strassmann, a top US defense expert on cyber-espionage, reported that China had inserted\n“zombie” programs in some 700,000 computers in the US which could be used to mount cyber attack to\nretrieve emails from other computers. The Chinese service also reportedly penetrated companies that\nprovide Internet services, including Google Yahoo, Symantec, and Adobe, which allowed it to track emails\nand enclosures of individuals. With such an invisible army of zombie computers, it is not entirely\nsurprising that China finds little need to employ human: sleeper” agents.\n\nChinese cyber-specialists used this capability to hack into computers of outside contractors,\nincluding Booz Allen and other companies that supplied technologists to the NSA. It also had\nnotable successes in obtaining the dossiers of US employees and independent contractors at the\nNSA, CIA and other intelligence services. Its intrusions, as previously noted, into computer\nnetwork at the Office of Personnel Management traced back to 2009. Eventually, by 2015,\naccording to US estimates, the cyber attack had harvested over twenty million personnel files of\npast and present Federal government employees. In addition, it reaped in over 14 million\nbackground checks of intelligence workers done by the Federal Investigative Service.

Based on calculations from the stated investment strategy for the fund, the\nreturns were not only orbiting outside the financial stratosphere, but were mathematically impossible. The\nofficer contacted the Securities and Exchange Commission, outlined the problem, and asked them to look\ninto it. No reply. Year after year, the officer continued to contact the SEC about this case, explaining that\nit was potentially lethal, that he had no personal investments in the fund, and had never been an\nemployee. No reply. Then, in 2007, he sent the SEC a 17-page report, showing why there was only one\nplausible conclusion: the stated strategy for the fund was a fraudulent cover up for a massive money-\nmaking scheme. Eventually, in 2008, the brains behind this scheme was ousted, escorted to a life in prison\nas number 61727-054, and welcomed to his new home by a community of like-minded white-collar\ncriminals.\n\nMeet HARRY MARKOPOLOS — the investment officer — MADOFF SECURITIES — the seductive\ninvestment opportunity — and BERNARD MADOFF — the genius behind one of the most spectacular\nPonzi schemes in recorded history. Whistleblowers started warning the SEC as early as 1992, but no one\nlistened. Madoff was making money hand over fist by pocketing new investments and if needed, using\nsome of these to pay off individuals wishing to redeem their funds. Ponzi schemes work as long as new\ninvestments exceed the number of investors wishing to redeem their own investments. And for Madoff,\nthis balancing act worked for 16 years. Then, as in the Bible’s Book of Joshua, the walls came tumbling\ndown, with Jericho riding in to hand Madoff a 150-year prison term for the financial murder of his\ntrusting clients. Altogether, these innocent and trusting people lost approximately $65 billion dollars, all\n\nbecause one man allowed his desire for wealth and power to run out of control.

But who knows, I \nmight be wrong. \ntoo many people, so many mass executions of the elderly and infirm make sense \nis the fundamental fact that everyone dies at some time .make it imporrisbole to ask so why not earilier. if \nthe brain discards unused neurons, why shold socieity keep their equivalent \nThe radical idea of treating individuals in a society as cells and the society itself as a well-organized organism \nis fascism, or course. Probably the most efficient and rationally stringent way of governance, if someone could \npull it off in a sustainable way; and if it is aggressive and expansive, its efficiency makes it a virus that \neverybody will want to stomp out. Fascism makes romantic doo-gooders like me very uncomfortable (I visited \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 026394 \nKZ Buchenwald five times and it had a profound influence on me; we East Germans inoculated ourselves very \nthoroughly against fascism), and the general public will not be willing to consider it. \nI rather like the treatment Fascism gets in the Amazon Series \"The Man in the High Castle\", which explores \nwhat would have happened if the Germans and Japanese had won the war: A society that tries to function as a \nbrutal and ruthlessly efficient machine, eliminating all social and evolutionary slack. It is very dark, but not a \nflat caricature of pointless evil for its own sake. Heinlein's late book \"Starship Troopers\" explores fascism, too, \nbut unlike Philipp K Dick he does not see it as a form of insanity, but as the most desirable order. \nI find your \"political incorrectness\" very fascinating. In the beginning, I thought it is a form of costly signaling, \nbut now I think you are simply entirely unconstrained in your thoughts. How did you manage in your youth? \nDid you get in trouble, or did you keep your thoughts to yourself? I wonder what kind of person you want to \ntransform into. \nIt was interesting to notice that at the Forbidden Research conference, nobody managed to say anything \nremotely out-of line. One large discussion group wanted to address the question of whether \"democracy still \nworks\", and mostly expressed their disagreement with Trump. Ideology is like halitosis: easy to see in others, \nhard in oneself A speaker felt that the media \"stifle all criticism of Trump\", another wanted to remove \"men \nand Elon Musk from government\", and everybody strongly agreed that we need more diversity everywhere. \nI noticed some time ago that Joi has remarkable public communication skills. He picks controversial, insight-\nladen topics, but sanitizes them by carefully replacing the parts of content that would divide his audience with \nsymbolic messages that everybody can fill with their own content in a way that resonates with them. The non-\ncontroversial parts will still be insightful. He manages to come across as very subversive, while rarely \noffending anyone (except the hard scientists, that miss hard substance). \nHe also asks influential people and smart students or faculty to write parts of his essays and speeches for him. \nThis invests them in his success, especially because he is going to reward and acknowledge them. Very few of \nhis ideas are original, instead he is good at identifying and testing thoughts he reads or hears from others. \nI am still beset by the ruinous instinct that the goal of communication ought to be mutual understanding. Joi is \nright. Public communication is about reaching one's goals. \nBests, \nJoscha \nOn Sun, Jul 10, 2016 at 12:42 AM, Joscha Bach <_ \nDear Jeffrey, \n> wrote: \nthank you for your support and encouragement, even where I fail. \nSorry for being such an embarrassment today. I will spell out today's argument a bit better and cohesive when \nI get to it. Also, I should have recognized that the main point I tried to make would trigger Noam (who was as \nalways very generous, patient, kind and humble on the personal level, even though he did not feel like \nconceding anything on the conceptual one). Almost all of Noam's work focused on the idea that humans have \nvery specific circuits or modules (even when most people in his field began to have other ideas), and his \nfrustration is that it is so hard to find or explain them. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 026395 \nI found Noam's hypothesis very compelling in the past. I still think that the idea that language is somehow a \ncultural or social invention of our species is wrong. But I think that there is a chance (we don't know that, but \nit seems to most promising hypothesis IMHO) that the difference between humans and apes is not a very \nintricate special circuit, but genetically simple developmental switches. The bootstrapping of cognition works \nlayer by layer during the first 20 years of our life. Each layer takes between a few months and a few years to \ntrain in humans. While a layer is learned, there is not much going on in the higher layers yet, and after the low \nlevel learning is finished, it does not change very much. This leads to the characteristic bursts in child \ndevelopment, that have famously been described by Piaget. \nThe first few layers are simple perceptual stuff, the last ones learn social structure and self-in-society. The \nswitching works with something like a genetic clock, very slowly in humans, but much more quickly in other \napes, and very fast in small mammals. As a result, human children take nine months before their brains are \nmature enough to crawl, and more than a year before they can walk. Many African populations are quite a bit \nfaster. In the US, black children outperform white children in motor development, even in very poor and \nsocially disadvantaged households, but they lag behind (and never catch up) in cognitive development even \nafter controlling for family income. \nGorillas can crawl after 2 months, and build their own nests after 2.5 years. They leave their mothers at 3-4 \nyears. Human children are pretty much useless during the first 10-12 years, but during each phase, their brains \nhave the opportunity to encounter many times as much training data as a gorilla brain. Humans are literally \nsmarter on every level, and because the abilities of the higher levels depend on those of the lower levels, they \ncan perform abstractions that mature gorillas will never learn, no matter how much we try to train them. \nThe second set of mechanisms is in the motivational system. Motivation tells the brain what to pay attention \nto, by giving reward and punishment. If a brain does not get much reward for solving puzzles, the individual \nwill find mathematics very boring and won't learn much of it. If a brain gets lots of rewards for discovering \nother people's intentions, it will learn a lot of social cognition. \nLanguage might be the result of three things that are different in humans: \n- extended training periods per layer (after the respective layer is done, it is difficult to learn a new set of \nphonemes or the first language) \n- more layers \n- different internal rewards. Perhaps the reward for learning grammatical structure is the same that makes us \nlike music. Our brains may enjoy learning compositional regular structure, and they enjoy making themselves \nunderstood, and everything else is something the universal cortical learning figures out on its own. \nThis is a hypothesis that is shared by a growing number of people these days. In humans, it is reflected for \ninstance by the fact that races with faster motor development have lower IQ. (In individuals of the same \ngroup, slower development often indicates defects, of course.) \nAnother support comes from machine learning: we find that the same learning functions can learn visual and \nauditory pattern recognition, and even end-to-end-learning. Google has built automatic image recognition into \ntheir current photo app: \nhttp://blogs.wsj . com/digits/2015/07/01/go o gle-mistakenly-tags-black-p eop le-as-gorillas-showing-limits-o f-\nalgorithms/  \nThe state of the art in research can do better than that: it can begin to \"imagine\" things. I.e. when the \nexperimenter asks the system to \"dream\" what a certain object looks like, the system can produce a somewhat \ncompelling image, which indicates that it is indeed learning visual structure. This stuff is something nobody \ncould do a few months ago: \nhttp://www.creativeai.net/posts/Mv4WG6rdzAerZF7ch/synthesizing-preferred-inputs-via-deep-generator-\nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 026396 \nnetworks \nA machine learning program that can learn how to play an Atari game without any human supervision or \nhand-crafted engineering (the feat that gave DeepMind 500M from Google) now just takes about 130 lines of \nPython code. \nThese models do not have interesting motivational systems, and a relatively simple architecture. They \ncurrently seem to mimic some of the stuff that goes on in the first few layers of the cortex. They learn object \nfeatures, visual styles, lighting and rotation in 3d, and simple action policies. Almost everything else is \nmissing. But there is a lot of enthusiasm that the field might be on the right track, and that we can learn motor \nsimulations and intuitive physics soon. (The majority of the people in Al do not work on this, however. They \ntry to improve the performance for the current benchmarks.) \nNoam's criticism of machine translation mostly applies to the Latent Semantic Analysis models that Google \nand others have been using for many years. These models map linguistic symbols to concepts, and relate \nconcepts to each other, but they do not relate the concepts to \"proper\" mental representations of what objects \nand processes look like and how they interact. Concepts are probably one of the top layers of the learning \nhierarchy, i.e. they are acquired *after* we learn to simulate a mental world, not before. Classical linguists \nignored the simulation of a mental world entirely. \nIt seems miraculous that purely conceptual machine translation works at all, but that is because concepts are \nshared between speakers, so the structure of the conceptual space can be inferred from the statistics of \nlanguage use. But the statistics of language use have too little information to infer what objects look like and \nhow they interact. \nMy own original ideas concern a few parts of the emerging understanding of what the brain does. The \n\"request-confirmation networks\" that I have introduced at a NIPS workshop in last the December are an \nattempt at modeling how the higher layers might self-organize into cognitive programs. \nCheers! \nJoscha \nplease note \nThe information contained in this communication is \nconfidential, may be attorney-client privileged, may \nconstitute inside information, and is intended only for \nthe use of the addressee.

Rev. 861, *935\n\nOnce the victim receives relevant information from a presentence report, the victim no less than other participants at sentencing\nshould be entitled to be heard on any disputed issues. For example, in a fraud case, if the defendant claims to have swindled\nonly $ 5,000 and the government claims the loss is $ 10,000, the victim should be entitled to press her argument that the loss\nwas $ 40,000. To do otherwise, is to deprive the victim of an opportunity to participate in the sentencing process and to turn the\nvictim impact statement into a meaningless charade.\n\nThe Advisory Committee's view on this point is curious. The Advisory Committee did not directly quarrel with the position\nthat victims should have the opportunity to be heard on disputed sentencing issues. Instead, the Advisory Committee would\nonly go so far as to suggest that it\n\nfelt it would be desirable for the courts gradually to flesh out what the right to be heard means in this [sentencing] context\n(determining, for example, when the right to be heard would include the right to introduce evidence). It is by no means clear\nthat the CVRA contemplates that victims will be entitled to access all of the particulars of the presentence report and be entitled\nto litigate issues concerning the application of various guidelines, etc. +1\n\nThis view is objectionable on many levels. First, given the congressional purpose of fundamentally changing the way crime\nvictims are treated in the criminal justice process, it can hardly be desirable for courts to \"gradually\" determine what rights\nvictims have. As Senator Kyl explained, \"A central reason for these rights is to force a change in a criminal justice culture\nwhich has failed to focus on the legitimate interests of crime victims.\" 419 The CVRA was \"meant to correct, not continue, the\nlegacy of the poor treatment of crime victims in the criminal process.\" 4°\n\nSecond, the Committee diffidently opines that \"it is by no means clear\" that victims have the right to litigate disputed issues.\n421 | will turn to the substance of that claim shortly. But even assuming it to be true, a fundamental purpose of the Federal\nRules of Criminal Procedure is to provide clarity on issues that would otherwise have to be litigated. *** The Advisory\nCommittee could be \"clear\" that victims can litigate by simply putting in place my proposed rule. To do otherwise [*936] is,\nunfortunately, to invite continued uncertainty over a point of vital importance to crime victims.\n\nFinally, perhaps the reason that the Advisory Committee would venture only that it is unclear whether victims have the right to\ndispute sentencing issues was a reluctance to stake out the contrary position. To maintain that victims cannot dispute sentencing\nissues would collide with both statutes and common sense. As for statutory requirements, it is hard to understand how victims\nwill be \"reasonably heard\" at sentencing (as the CVRA commands) if they cannot contest the factors that may well drive a\nsentence - the Guidelines calculations. Moreover, Congress has already directly mandated that victims will have the\nopportunity to dispute sentencing factors when they relate to restitution. 4°? Thus, if the Advisory Committee really wanted to\nstake out a victims-can't-litigate-at-sentencing position, it would have to awkwardly carve out a restitution exception. Finally, a\nvictim is simply not treated with \"fairness\" if she is entirely excluded from the Guidelines process. The Supreme Court has\nexplained that \"it is ... fundamental that the right to ... an opportunity to be heard \"must be granted at a meaningful time and in\na meaningful manner.\" 44 It is not \"meaningful\" for victims to make sentencing recommendations without the benefit of\nknowing what everyone else in that courtroom knows - what the recommended Guidelines range is.

Why is this? Diagnosis is a\nmatter of both reasoning from evidence and understanding what to\nlook for to gather evidence. Given all the evidence, it is easy to make\na diagnosis in an area of knowledge you don’t know very well. So, the\ngathering of the evidence is the most important part. Crime analysts\nand gardeners both do diagnosis. They both reason from evidence.\nWhat separates them is knowing what constitutes important evidence\nand what does not. Here again, this comes from experienced cases.\n\nAnalytic processes involve attention to details that enable the\nforming of hypotheses that can be tested by a variety of methods.\nThese three pieces, determining evidence, forming hypotheses, and\ntesting hypotheses, are what is commonly referred to as the scientific\nmethod. When science is taught, it often dwells on the facts of science\nrather than the process. Diagnosis is about the process. But the process\nis not of much use without domain knowledge. Domain knowledge\nis often about causality, although that knowledge of causality may be\nsubconscious. Experts know what causes an engine to misfire so they\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_023795\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

This regulatory change\nfollowed a favorable Supreme Court ruling for a young girl who treated her Lennox-\nGastaut syndrome with CBD oil in 2015. It is permitted to have medical cannabis\nproducts with up to 1% THC content and these products are regulated by the Health\nMinistry. Aurora (through their subsidiary Farmacias Magistrales) recently received a\nlicense to import medical cannabis products containing over 1% THC. Pharamacielo\nrecently announced a JV with Mexican pharmaceutical company MINO Labs S.A. de CV.\nto distribute medical cannabis domestically.\n\nMexico is the second largest hemp producer in Latin America. The law changed in 2017\nto permit the cultivation and processing of industrial hemp. In November 2018, the\ngovernment released a list of 38 OTC products — 21 food supplements, 9 cosmetics, 6\nedibles or beverages, 2 raw material - that have been approved for sale in the country.\nSeven companies received authorization for these products, which includes 2 American,\n4 Mexican and 1 Spanish company. These products must contain no more than 1% THC.\nProducts can be purchased through retail stores and e-commerce sites. The regulatory\nagency authorizing these products is the Mexican Federal Commission for Protection\nAgainst Sanitary Risks.\n\nMexico has announced plans to legalize cannabis for adult-use purposes in 2019, which\nwould significantly change the shape of the market opportunities. The country would\nbecome the third in the world to implement a nationwide policy to legalize cannabis for\nall purposes. In the proposed legislation there would include six types of cultivation\nlicenses — 1. Personal, 2. Scientific, 3. Therapeutic, 4. Recreational, 5. Pharmaceutical\nand 6. Industrial - five manufacturing licenses - 1. Personal, 2. Therapeutic, 3.\nPharmaceutical, 4. Recreational and 5. Industrial - and three distribution licenses - 1.\nTherapeutic, 2. Pharmaceutical and 3. Industrial. These considerations are still pending.\nWhile this will bring many changes to the regulatory framework, home-grow has been\nlegal for personal use since 2015.\n\nFormer President Vicente Fox has become a public figure in the cannabis industry by\naccepting a position at Khiron Life Sciences, one of the leading Latin American\nproducers. The company launched a nutraceutical line, Kuida Life Mexico S.A., at the end\nof 2018. They receive approval to import CBD-based supplement products for sleep,\ndigestion and muscle recovery. Khiron also entered a JV with American edibles company\nDixie Brands for distribution in the Latin American market.\n\nUruguay\n\nUruguay was the first country in the world to legalize cannabis for all purposes\nnationwide in 2017. However, medical cannabis has been regulated in the country since\n2013 and an industrial hemp program has been implemented since 2010. The Institution\nof Regulation and Control of Cannabis provides regulatory oversight for the medical\nmarket.\n\nThere are two licensed producers in Uruguay, and thus, the market has not opened to\nmany foreign entities. This has led to a shortage of supply for the domestic market.\n\nAddressing supply issues, the country announced plans to rework the framework to\npermit more imports and opened applications for up to five more licenses.\n\nCOWEN.COM 85\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_024901\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

You likely know that ARCOM is working\nwith Mr. Trump to re-install a hedge on his North County Road property. | believe this case is now\npending in front of Code Enforcement. In May, ARCOM approved a plan to replace the former hedge\nwith silver buttonwood shrubbery, which would additionally be back-planted with silver buttonwood\ntrees....the overall effect would be an eventual 20' high screen. The shrubs have been planted, but\nyesterday attorney Ray Royce asked for postponing the trees until the end of the Hurricane season.\nARCOM said NO and directed the attorney and landscaper to get the trees in ASAP. Also, more\nshrubbery was required at the main entry (north side) to match the newly installed hedge on the south\nside.\n\nAs the meeting was ending, the Commissioners asked for one of two things. They asked that either 1) a\nquick written report from Code Enforcement be made available to them at their next meeting on July 23\n(9:00 a.m.) about the enforcement status of the case, or 2) that someone from Code Enforcement attend\ntheir meeting to provide a verbal status report. Their patience is wearing thin with the whole hedge issue,\nand it has them naturally curious about what is happening with their counterparts on Code Enforcement.\n\nWould you or the appropriate representative from Code Enforcement be available on July 23? That\n\nwould be my preference because follow-up questions almost always pop up. If not, can you provide me\nwith a brief summary of your enforcement history and pending status?

He\ncomes to us once again from Beijing. We talked this time\nyesterday. Good to have you back. And we discussed\nyesterday what we would learn about that lineup of the\nstanding committee. It hadn’t been revealed at that point\nthat we spoke, but we now know and is it correct to say the\nmost significant thing is no sign of a leader in waiting?\nRLK: I think the most significant sign is who the people are\nand how they relate to each other. It’s a group that actually\nrespects traditional norms.\nRLK: There was thought that Wang Qishan, for example,\nmight violate norms by being on the Standing Committee\nafter the traditional retirement age and that’s not the case.\nThere is balance among the member in terms of their\ngeographies, even their political affiliations within the party\nwhich internally are important. Two are from Shanghai,\ntwo are from the Communist Youth League - one is actually\nfrom Shanghai and the Youth League as well but he’s really\nfrom Shanghai - two have a long relationship with General\nSecretary Xi. And then of course General Secretary Xi has\nthe overarching power as everyone says - and that is correct\nand will be correct for a long time to come.\n\nHOST: Absolutely, well certainly but breaking precedent by\nnot having a young leader coming up behind him and we\ndiscussed this yesterday. The transfer of Mr. Xi will remain\nin power for many more years to come, perhaps revive the\nposition of party chairman and stick around indefinitely.\nRLK: There’s no question about the power and longevity of\nXi. I would put it a little differently. I’d say that it is not\neven necessary for him to have the party chairmanship or\nany particular title because of his overarching power by\nhaving his name associated with “Xi Jinping Thought on\nSocialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era” - that\nwhole phrase is now in the Party Constitution. Moreover, he\nalready had the designation of “Core” of the Party.\nRLK: So those two elements – name in Constitution and\nCore - are totally overarching over any particular title. That\nsaid, not having a younger member of the Standing\nCommittee who is an obvious candidate for future\nleadership, prevents there being a separate power center\nthat could undermine what Xi wants to do. So the fact that\nXi will be there until, potentially, the mid-2030s is very real.\nI think now we should shift our attention to what Xi Jinping\nwants to do. We need to look at the policies he is putting\nforth, and see what they mean for China and for the world.\nHOST: And I want to touch on that in a moment, but given\nthis power and position afforded to him in the constitution\nno less, I mean where is room for discussion?\n2\nHOST: If not dissent at least a little difference in opinion\nwhen those who don’t agree with him basically, because he’s\nin the constitution, are against the communist party. They\ncan leave or they can put up with it, no middle ground or\nperhaps question?\nRLK: This is a very interesting point and it goes to the party\nconcept of what they call democratic centralism and\ncollective leadership. When Xi was appointed Core about a\nyear ago, which was a very significant move, the party also\nsaid it was reaffirming collective leadership. Now that\nseems on its surface an oxymoron, contradictory, but in the\nChinese system it was not, and it’s good to understand why.\nRLK: Xi has overarching decision making power which he\ndidn’t have before he was made ‘core’. But he is obligated\nunder the system to respect the system - if he continues to\ndo so, and I certainly expect he will - to really listen to all of\nthe opinions of the senior leaders, certainly the people in\nthe standing committee. And to conduct substantial\nresearch, reviews with experts, and polling and iterative\nkinds of research that they do for all their major documents.\nSo he is obligated to do such serious consultation under the\nparty system. Now can he subvert it the way Mao did? I\ndon’t think that’s really possible even if he tried and I don’t\nthink he will do that. So it’s a combination of him now\nhaving the absolute power, no question about it, but still\nrespecting party norms of how they go about the research\nand decision-making process.\n3\nRLK: Now this will not mean overt dissent from the media.\nCertainly, that has been suppressed and will arguably for\nthe foreseeable future continue to be. But in the inner\ncircles, he is obligated to continue to seek guidance and get\nalternative opinions.\nHOST: Speaking of the media you just reminded me of\nsomething and we were having a lovely conversation\nyesterday. I don’t think either of was being particularly\nrude or anything. And let’s put up the video because you\nand I were chatting about, just regular Chinese politics and\nwhat was happening and this was what happened in our\noffice. We were shut down by the censors in the middle of\nour conversation. What does that say about how things are\ngoing to be run?\nRLK: China is extremely sensitive during this particular\ntime of the 19th CPC National Congress. They do that for all\nnational meetings but this is probably the most central time.\nAll elements of media are under strictures. Who knows at\nwhat level decisions are made? But even internet\nconnections this week have been terrible because of\nextreme censorship. I expect that will lessen in the future.\nBut it is endemic of the situation and we will all learn to live\nwith it. As I said, there’s a larger picture here about what Xi\nis going to do in terms of his people orientation,\nrejuvenating China, comprehensively deepening reform,\nand strengthening rule of law.\n4\nRLK: We have to wait and see how that strengthening of\nreform and strengthening of rule of law is going to turn out.\nHOST: Indeed. I do have one final question because Mr.\nTrump is heading that way in a matter of days really. What\ndoes Mr. Xi make of Donald Trump? Donald Trump thinks\nthey’re best buddies. What do you think Mr. Xi makes of\nDonald Trump?\nRLK: Before Trump came into office I know very specifically\nthere were various think tanks that were engaging in\nvarious scenario planning on how to deal with Trump and\nhis vicissitudes.\nRLK: And the conclusion was to let it play out, don’t react\nto virtually anything, and treat the U.S. just like it did in\nnormal times. And so I think that will be the approach. It’ll\nbe very straight forward. China won’t react to the highs or\nlows. It’ll treat the protocol at a very high level. And I think\nbased on Trump’s personality that he will react well to that.\nThe substance that comes out of that, whether it’s North\nKorea or trade, will have to wait. We could be quite\nskeptical about the substance of the results, but I think the\nform will look good.\nHOST: It’s going to be fascinating. Robert Lawrence Kuhn,\ngreat to have you on again. Appreciate your insights. Thank\nyou.\n5\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

As a Pole who is at least somewhat aware of the politics and economics of Poland, and a\njournalist who follows world politics and news developments daily, I am severely disappointed at the number of\npeople that are flocking to these conspiracy theories, and academics and professionals who propagate such ideas\nshould themselves feel ashamed.\n\nFirstly, there is absolutely no proof that there was any sabotage or subterfuge by either the Russians or the\nPrime Minister's political allies. Such accusations, then, without presenting any credible evidence, are\nslanderous.\n\nAlso, there would be no political or diplomatic capital gained by either of the \"accused\"... there would be little\nfor the Russian government to gain - it would be a huge diplomatic embarrassment for the Russian government\nto be found guilty of essentially assassinating a head of state. Kaczynski was one of the strongest allies of the\nU.S. among European leaders, and even Russia with its assertive diplomatic policies would not risk a complete\nbreakdown with the U.S. by killing a close ally. International condemnation would also follow, and the\nPresident - perhaps even the Prime Minister - would have to resign and wave good-bye to any political career in\nthe foreseeable future. Yes, \"even in Russia.\"\n\nSimilarly, for the Prime Minister's party, if he were actually complicit in the crash, that would mean he - or his\nallies - committed a coup d'etat. Also, there will be early presidential elections in June, which might actually go\nin favor of the President's party because of a sympathy vote. The \"acting\" Presidency is in the hands of his party\nfor only two months... so, again, the Prime Minister and his allies have nothing to gain and potentially\neverything to lose in the June vote.\n\nConspiracy-monging cheapens a national tragedy\n\nPolitical profit or loss questions aside, however, the conspiracy-monging seems to be taken as a way to discover\nwho's responsible for the tragedy and thus somehow bring them justice. However, it is not a healthy way to deal\nwith the tragedy. It is not conducive to national or personal healing. Furthermore, it disgraces and taints the\nmemory of those who died.\n\nIt only cheapens the tragedy and, sadly, may foreshadow what's to come in the coming presidential campaign -\nthe tragedy may be used by certain groups or individuals to propagate their own agenda and assume the\npresidency.\n\nIt is not so different than what has been going on in the U.S., with the \"birthers\" claiming Barack Obama is not\nlegally the President because he is not actually a citizen, or even natural-born citizen. Not as morbid, of course,\nbut still, in my honest opinion, ridiculous.\n\nBaseless, nonsensical conspiracies simply destroys the abiltiy of the nation and people of Poland to move on\nand honor the memory of those lost, and cheapens the tragedy that has been felt by Poles as far away as Chicago\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_032048\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

OLC found this to be a difficult question before concluding\nthat a grand jury could indict the vice president. The memo notes that Vice President Spiro\nAgnew was said to be part of a conspiracy and that it would be difficult to have a proper\nindictment of co-conspirators without including the vice president (a point also true of a\nconspiracy involving a president). Moreover,\n\nAnother circumstance counselling prompt presentation of evidence to the grand jury is that\nthe statute of limitations is about to bar prosecution of the alleged offenders with respect to\nsome or all of the offenses. The problem presented by the statute of limitations would be\navoided by an indictment within the statutorily specified period.\n\n(The issue of statute of limitations arises as well in cases involving a president.)\n\nThe Dixon memo concludes that “[a]fter indictment, the question of whether the\nGovernment should ... delay prosecution until the expiration of the Vice President’s duties\ninvolves questions of trial strategy” beyond OLC’s expertise.\n\nThe conclusion that the sitting president should not be indicted was not necessarily a\ncategorical constitutional-judgment conclusion but seems, rather, to be a balance of policy\nconsiderations. That, it appears, is how it was read by the office of Special Prosecutor Leon\nJaworski—as I will describe below.\n\n2. The Oct. 5, 1973, Brief for the United States in In re Agnew. Lawyers for Vice\nPresident Spiro T. Agnew argued that if a president could not be indicted while in office,\nthat same immunity should apply to a serving vice president. The vice president should have\nthe same immunity as the president, they wrote, because he “must maintain himself in a state\nof constant preparation to replace the president.” And as the official with responsibility for\ninitiating the 25th Amendment removal process, he must “continuously ... monitor the\nability of the President” to discharge his duties. These responsibilities, they argued, were\nincompatible with being a defendant in a criminal case. Agnew’s civil action, moreover,\nsought to enjoin the grand jury from even “conducting any investigation” into the allegations\nagainst Agnew as well as precluding “issuing any indictment.”\n\nThe United States, in a response filed in U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia by\nSolicitor General Robert Bork, opposed any immunity from criminal process for a vice\npresident. The solicitor general did inform the court, however, that if the grand jury were to\nreturn an indictment, the Department of Justice “will hold the proceedings in abeyance for a\nreasonable time, if the Vice President consents to a delay, in order to offer the House of\nRepresentatives an opportunity to consider the desirability of impeachment proceedings.”\nWhat was critical, according to Bork, was this: “The issuance of an indictment ... would in\nthe meantime toll the statute of limitations and preserve the matter for subsequent judicial\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_030202\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

In my first meeting, as a\nnewly promoted Major General, with our then Defence Minister Ariel Sharon,\nSharon turned to me and the army’s Chief of Staff, Rafael Eitan, and said: “Tell\nme. Why the hell is Arafat still alive?” He looked first at Raful, then at me, and\nadded: “When I was 20 years younger than you are, I never waited for someone\nlike Ben-Gurion or Dayan to ask me to plan an operation. I would plan it! Then\nI’d take it to them and say, you’re the politicians, you decide, but if you say yes,\nwe'll do it.” I smiled, telling him that I’d done exactly that, a decade earlier,\nonly to have one of his mates in the top brass say no. Sharon now said yes. But\nthe plan was overtaken: by his ill-fated plan to launch a full-scale invasion of\nLebanon in 1982, targeting not just Arafat, but with the aim of crushing the\nPLO militarily once and for all.\n\nI finally met Arafat face-to-face at the end of 1995. Although the Oslo peace\nprocess had dramatically changed things, it was clear that the real prize — real\npeace — was still far away. We were in Barcelona, for a Euro-Mediterranean\nmeeting under the auspices of King Juan Carlos, aimed at trying to re-invigorate\nnegotiations. The ceremonial centrepiece of the event was a dinner at one of the\nroyal palaces, and it was arranged for me and Arafat to meet for a few minutes\nbeforehand. | arrived first. I found myself in a breathtakingly opulent, but\notherwise empty, room. Empty, that is, except for a dark-brown Steinway piano.\nFrom childhood, I have loved music. And while I am never likely to threaten the\ncareer of anyone in the New York Philharmonic, I have, over the years,\ndeveloped some ability, and drawn huge enjoyment, as a classical pianist. I\npulled back the red-velvet bench and began to play. With my back to the\ndoorway, I was unaware that Arafat had arrived, and that he was soon standing\nonly a few feet away, watching as I played one of my favourite pieces, a Chopin\nwaltz. My old commando antennae must have been blunted. I may not have\nbecome “fat”.

Adams\n\nWhen children are born, they come with distinct personalities. Ask\nany mother of a second child. “It even behaved differently in the\nwomb,” she will say. One kid is aggressive while the other is contem-\nplative. One kid is constantly talking while the other hardly says a\nword. One kid is shy while the other is outgoing.\n\nOften, when we think about teaching and learning, we have the\nidea that if we want someone to do something, or know something,\nor behave in a certain way, all we have to do is teach it to them. So we\nteach kids to appreciate music, when they may have no interest in,\nor inclinations toward, music at all, or to act in the class play, when\nthey are simply bad at acting, or to throw a baseball when they simply\ncan’t do it and don’t care. Often, but not always, we are forgiving of\nthe differences between people and their individual talents and we\nacknowledge that she is tone deaf, or he will always throw poorly, and\nwe give up.\n\nSmall children are like sponges. They ask questions constantly\nand, if they have reasonable parents, get answers. The belief system\nthat children adopt is usually quite similar to that of their parents.\nThey don’t decide to try out a different religion at age 5; they do what\nthey have always known. They eat what they were fed and they like\nto go to places they have been taken. Parents influence every aspect of\na child’s belief system. Because of that, we have the sense that we can\nteach children anything, but this gets less true as they get older. The\nJesuits have a saying about teaching a child before he is 7 and thus\nproducing the man he will become. There is some truth to this. If you\nreally learn honesty when you are 5, it is unlikely you will become a\ncrook. Your subconscious wouldn’t permit it.\n\na5\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_023781\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

The answer is simple. There is lots of\nmoney invested in testing by powerful players. Kids are no one’s main\nconcern.\n\nSo the money for the new plan will not be coming from the\ngovernment.\n\nWhat about from business? Venture capital, for example?\n\nIs a new kind of high school offered online likely to be a successful\nbusiness venture? One mentor in the story-centered curriculum can\nhandle between 20 and 50 students, depending on the mentot’s expe-\nrience. Assuming that the students pay tuition that covers the men-\ntor’s salary, which means they need to pay at least $3,000 a year, more\nor less, in tuition, it shouldn’t cost anything to run.

Initial investment is about $2 million\nto build a curriculum, but enough students paying reasonable tuitions\nwill pay that investment back quickly enough. So, is this a big business\nopportunity?\n\nActually I doubt it. I think that it is a big opportunity for universi-\nties that traditionally charge large tuitions. We have had a great deal\nof success with master’s degrees, for example. But universities typically\ndon’t invest $2 million in anything, even if it does have great upside\npotential. When Carnegie Mellon University made that investment in\nits West Coast campus (where I was designing the curriculum), it did\nso without quite knowing it was doing so because the person in charge\ndidn’t tell the University officials what he was up to. Universities typi-\ncally don’t think about investing money in order to make money in\nthe daily enterprise. Businesses do think that way, of course, but busi-\nnesses have trouble starting universities that are accredited. I worked for\nTrump University, which supposedly was going to do exactly that, but\nthey never could raise enough money or figure out how to be accred-\nited. So there is a potentially very big business in master’s degrees, but\nit needs some well-financed and prescient people to make it happen.\n\nHigh schools are another story. I actually do not believe that busi-\nness will invest in online high schools whose mission is to overthrow\nthe existing system. Venture capitalists are not revolutionaries.

Even without official confirmation of that source’s name, the news so\n\nfar holds some stunning implications.\n\nAmong them is that the Justice Department and Federal Bureau of Investigation outright hid critical\ninformation from a congressional investigation. In a Thursday press conference, Speaker Paul Ryan bluntly\nnoted that Intelligence Chairman Devin Nunes’s request for details on this secret source was “wholly\n\n99 66\n\nappropriate,” “completely within the scope” of the committee’s long-running FBI investigation, and\n“something that probably should have been answered a while ago.” Translation: The department knew full\nwell it should have turned this material over to congressional investigators last year, but instead deliberately\n\nconcealed it.\n\nHouse investigators nonetheless sniffed out a name, and Mr. Nunes in recent weeks issued a letter and a\nsubpoena demanding more details. Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein’s response was to double\ndown—accusing the House of “extortion” and delivering a speech in which he claimed that “declining to\nopen the FBI’s files to review” is a constitutional “duty.” Justice asked the White House to back its\nstonewall. And it even began spinning that daddy of all superspook arguments—that revealing any detail\n\nabout this particular asset could result in “loss of human lives.”\n\nThis is desperation, and it strongly suggests that whatever is in these files is going to prove very\n\nuncomfortable to the FBI.\n\nThe bureau already has some explaining to do. Thanks to the Washington Post’s unnamed law-enforcement\nleakers, we know Mr. Nunes’s request deals with a “top secret intelligence source” of the FBI and CIA, who\nis a U.S. citizen and who was involved in the Russia collusion probe.

He said he\nwas not denying there were incidents with Duke. Palm Beach County had the dog\ntaken into custody and the hearing was held June 5, 2008. At that hearing, it was\nagreed upon by the County and Dr. Lynn that the dog would be classified as\ndangerous. The dog was classified as dangerous which required certain\nrestrictions on the dog which Dr. Lynn complied with and the dog was returned to\nhim. In the event Duke has another incident, pursuant to state and county law, but\nsome reason not Town law, the dog would be taken into custody and euthanized.\nMr. Merola said Dr. Lynn feels very badly about the situation and agreed with the\nCounty to do what they required. Mr. Merola said Dr. Lynn then received a\nletter, dated June 16, 2008 from the police department, mentioning the order of\nthe County and stating for the first time, the Town was declaring the dog\ndangerous and giving him ten (10) days to appeal, which he did not. On June 20,\n2008, four (4) days after the dog was declared dangerous by the Town, the police\ndepartment sent a second letter, citing 10-45 (i), advising that since the dog\nalready had two incidents, they wanted it removed or euthanized. The dog had not\ndone anything since being declared dangerous. This letter did not mention an\nappeal, but he sent a letter anyway, stating that they did not agree with that. He\nsaid the dog was declared dangerous on the 16\", requirements were imposed and\nthey complied with those, including the filing of a $1000 bond and they did not\nagree the dog should now be removed.

Consequently, it is now critically important that the United States and \nits few allies cooperate closely. Unfortunately, this has not been the case in recent weeks for US-\nIsrael relations regarding Iran's nuclear program. The disagreement about attacking Iran's \nnuclear facilities has turned into ugly bickering, much of it disguised. This is harmful for both \nIsrael and the United States. \nTo heal this rift — which is necessary to effectively address the Iranian threat — we must \nunderstand the following basic facts: \n1. The Israeli fear of a nuclear Iran is genuine. It is not a political trick of Prime Minister \nBenjamin Netanyahu or Defense Minister Ehud Barak. A nuclear Iran would bolster and \nencourage extremist militant forces across the region. The moderates would be discouraged, \nintimidated and invariably weakened to the point where they would be unable to negotiate with \nIsrael. In just a few years, Israel will be surrounded by three Pakistan-like' countries: Saudi \nArabia, Egypt and Turkey. All three would possess nuclear weapons and be dominated \npolitically by Islamists. In such a scenario, Israel would lose its strategic advantage in the region. \nIt would lose its lead as a country of entrepreneurship and excellence, as foreign investment \nwould decline and talented young Israelis would build their future abroad. No responsible Israeli \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 027099 \nleader will allow such a nightmare to become a reality. The hateful declarations of Iran's leaders, \ncommitted to wiping the Jewish state off the map, do not assuage Israelis' fears. \n2. Economic sanctions cannot convince the regime in Teheran to abandon its nuclear project. \nHowever, sanctions can bring about the collapse of the regime if they are vigorously \nimplemented and enforced. \n3. An American military strike against Iran's nuclear facilities would be more effective \nthan an Israeli one. But disparaging Israel's capabilities and its military ingenuity, undermining \nits deterrence effect, is a grave mistake. \n4. Israel's operational window is closing. If Israel has to cope alone with the Iranian threat, its \nwindow of operational opportunity is narrower than the American one. It has to act sooner. \n5. An Israeli military strike in the next two months, contravening repeated demands by the \nU.S. President to postpone it, would be counterproductive. The damage of defying the \nPresident would be greater than the damage sustained by allowing the Iranian regime an \nadditional few months of advancing toward acquiring the bomb. Such a strike may broaden the \ngap between the U.S. and Israel and weaken the alliance, which all previous Israeli Prime-\nMinisters have safeguarded as a strategic asset of Israel. \n6. The United States has failed to prevent countries like Pakistan or North Korea from \nobtaining nuclear weapons. This record feeds Israeli skepticism about a U.S. success in the \ncase of Iran. This skepticism prevails despite the clear rhetoric and unquestionable commitments \nof the President and the Secretaries of State and Defense to prevent a nuclear Iran. \n7. The fact that the Israeli Prime Minister and the Republican presidential candidate share \nthe same political benefactor feeds suspicions in the Obama administration about Netanyahu's \nmotives for attacking Iran a few weeks before the U.S. presidential elections. \n8. The regional perspective cannot continue ignoring the unresolved Israeli-Palestinian \nconflict. This issue can no longer be swept under the rug. Maintaining the status quo is politically \ncomfortable in the short-run, but it will be combustible and devastating in the long run. \nAchieving the two-state solution will preserve Israel as a Jewish, democratic state. It will end \nIsrael's regional isolation. It will rebuild America's standing and influence in the Arab and \nMuslim world. Furthermore, these last two outcomes will strengthen America's and Israel's \nhands in thwarting Iran's nuclear weapons ambitions. \nThese eight basic facts combine to produce a complex reality. When fully understood, they can \npave the way to restoring U.S.-Israeli harmony. There is no symmetry between the United States, \nthe super-power, and its tiny ally, Israel. But the \"package\" required from each side in order to \nmend fences has to include the following mutual commitments: \n1. Israel will not attack Iran in 2012. \n2. The United States will hold a joint intelligence estimate session with Israel in the early spring \nof 2013. If the conclusion of this joint estimate is that there is no substantial slow-down of the \nIranian nuclear project, the U.S. will take military action to destroy this project. \n3. The United States will oppose any attempt to intervene in Israel's strategic capacities and will \nprevent any monitoring of Israel's own strategic installations. At the same time, the United States \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 027100 \nwill uncompromisingly support Israel's right to preserve and develop its indigenous military \ncapacities. \n4. Israel will accept an American invitation to attend a peace conference that will be convened \nin the U.S. no later than mid-2013. This gathering will address the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, \naiming to resolve it once and for all with an agreed-upon timetable for implementation. \nThese four commitments would serve the interests of both the United States and Israel. They \nwould enable the U.S. to resume its leadership role of peacemaking in the Middle East. And they \nwould provide a basis for binding the U.S. and Israel together as they face these challenging \ntimes. \nEphraim Sneh, a retired IDF General, served as Israel's deputy minister of defense.

In the article, Gloria Steinem says that anyone could\nhave walked into the Ms. office in the 1970s and gotten a job. But I certainly never felt\nlike I could do that. I was actually living in New York when Ms. started, and I was even\nworking in publishing... but I grew up on a farm in the midwest, and I wasn't like the\nwomen who ran Ms. They felt like a club.\"\n\nMy upbringing has not been like my mother's. I grew up with a lot more privilege; my\nmother used to call me a spoiled \"princess\" when she was angry, and one of my ex-\nboyfriends used to tease me by calling me \"East Coast Intellectual.\" Yet in a lot of ways,\nit took me a while to get into feminism, too. Gender issues have always been a strand of\nmy thinking, but plenty of feminist discourse never impressed me. In university, I felt\nlike everything I heard from feminism was a tortured conspiracy theory. And although I\nidentified as \"feminist\" from the very beginning of blogging, it was out of a sense of\nresistance rather than feeling included. I felt like: Goddamnit, I will show you that I can\nbe an independent and rational woman who values voting and abortion rights and equal\nopportunity and consent -- and be into S&M at the same damn time.\n\nAs I kept writing, I was looking at other blogs about gender and sexuality, too. The ones\nwhose analysis really spoke to me were usually feminist blogs. And those were also,\noften, the bloggers who noticed me in return. My work was highlighted by a number of\nfeminist writers who wanted to raise my profile. Talking to them, I began to understand\nsome sophisticated critiques that I'd previously labeled \"conspiracy theories.” I expanded\nmy understanding of topics like rape culture, as well as \"tangential\" social justice issues\nlike race and class. My mother said to me, long afterwards: \"Feminism really reached out\nand grabbed you, didn't it.”\n\nIn 2011, I heard from a feminist friend about organizations that train volunteer advocates\nfor rape survivors. In Chicago and many other cities, when people who have been raped\ngo to the emergency room, the hospital will ask if they want an advocate. The advocate's\nrole is to provide immediate crisis counseling and to help the survivor deal with\ncomplexities of the medical and legal system. The minute I heard about advocacy, I knew\nI wanted to do it.\n\nIn 1970, my mother didn't have an advocate, for the simple reason that advocates did not\nyet exist. Rape Trauma Syndrome was first recognized by feminists in the 1970s, and\nassault advocacy was developed by feminists during that time as well.\n\nI told Mom all about the advocacy curriculum while I was completing it, and she drank\nup every detail. \"I never got support like that,\" she said. \"My boyfriend insisted that we\ngo to the emergency room, and I guess he tried to advocate for me, but the doctors and\nnurses ignored me for 20 hours and then sent me home. It was worse that the nurses did.\nIf sisterhood was powerful, then couldn't they reach out to me somehow?\" (Rape\nsurvivors -- at least in Illinois -- are now prioritized in emergency rooms, second only to\nlife-and-death situations.)\n\nMom often regales me with tales about how things used to be.

In Carlsmith’s experiments, the\nwitnesses learn of a misfortune, but the offender’s defection has a direct bearing on the witness in terms\nof money lost. Thus, although punishment may feel good, the benefit may not make up for the lost\nincome.\n\nEveryone in Carlsmith’s experiments also believed that punishment would cause people to think\nless about the offender. They were wrong again. Punishers, but not those who simply witnessed\npunishment, ruminated more about the selfish offenders. Rumination led to more bad feelings. These bad\nfeelings led to more rumination, giving birth to a vicious cycle of feeling bad and ruminating about those\nwho cheated them of some money. Rumination heightened the comparative difference in resources.\n\nCarlsmith’s findings are paradoxical and disturbing. Paradoxically, they suggest that in some\nsituations, our expectations about the feeling of punishing an immoral act are inverted from the feelings\nwe feel following punishment: rather than feeling a happy high, we feel a depressing low, often\naccompanied by increasing anger. In the context of punishing a free-rider who stiffed the group, everyone\nexpects to feel a tingle of delicious delight, but many end up feeling angry instead. The entire polarity of\nthe emotion has switched, with rumination and anger dominating our thoughts. This is a dangerous state\nto enter. Faced with the strong belief and desire that revenge should feel good, but lacking any\nconfirmation, we are moved to find new evidence. With anger at the helm, there is only one solution:\nescalate the level of punishment, and continue to do so until it feels good. This is precisely the pattern I\ndescribed above for obesity: the wanting system continues to search for liking and reward, but fails, and\nthus continues. Whether it is an unsatisfied desire for food or revenge, the unfortunate consequence is an\nescalation to excess. Evil isn’t far behind, fueled by a variety of situations in which we fail to obtain what\n\nwe want.\n\nThe great leveler\n\nWe are often envious of those who have what we desire, whether it is good looks, money, a warm\nsupportive family, or a better tennis stroke. Envy can motivate us to change our looks, find careers that\nwill improve our finances, seek relationships that will provide additional support, and pick up a few extra\ntennis lessons to win the next match. Unfortunately, envy can quickly turn, as desire and a deep sense of\ninferiority transform into insatiable cravings to acquire whatever is necessary to gain superiority. Envy\nthus wears two masks, one benign and inspirational, the other malignant and destructive. As the writer\n\nDorothy Sayers noted, envy “is the great leveler; if it cannot level things up, it will level them down.”\n\nHauser Chapter 2.

Middle-class taxpayers, people that are working-class\npeople, right, people making incomes under $50,000 and $60,000, it was the burden of\nthose taxpayers, right, that bailed out the elites. And let’s think about it for a second.\nHere’s how capitalism metastasized, is that all the burdens put on the working-class\npeople who get none of the upside. All of the upside goes to the crony capitalists.\n\nThe bailouts were absolutely outrageous, and here’s why: It bailed out a group of\nshareholders and executives who were specifically accountable. The shareholders were\naccountable for one simple reason: They allowed this to go wrong without changing\nmanagement. And the management team of this.

Loneliness has\nalso been associated with a decrease in\nhealth-restoring processes. Sleep is the\nquintessential example. Much of what\nfeels stressful and depressing at the end\nof a long day is perceived differently\nfollowing a good night’s sleep. Good\nquality sleep is the clincher. Lonely and\nnon-lonely individuals do not differ in\nthe amount of sleep they get, but lonely\npeople have poorer sleep quality than do\nnon-lonely people. They experience\nmore micro-awakenings during the night\nand they awake feeling more tired and\nless capable of meeting the demands of\nthe day.

In short, lonely days extend\ninto the nights and lessen the restorative\nnature of sleep.\n\nLoneliness and Health: It’s Not Just\nPeripheral\n\nFrom this sampling of the\nwidespread effects of loneliness on\nhealth, lifestyle behaviors, physiological\nfunctioning, genetic transcription, and\nsleep quality, it should be clear that the\ninvisible power of felt isolation has long\ntentacles that have the potential to\ninfluence all of physiology. Not only\nphysical health, but also cognitive health\nis compromised. Indeed, one of the most\nsobering findings of recent years is that\nloneliness places people at risk for\nimpaired cognition and dementia.\" In a\n4-year prospective study of initially\ndementia-free older adults, the risk of\nAlzheimer’s Disease was more than\n\nPage |45\n\ntwice as great in lonely than in\nnonlonely individuals. In addition,\nloneliness was associated with lower\ncognitive ability at baseline and with a\nmore rapid decline in cognition during\nthe 4-year follow-up. Similar results\nwere reported for a sample of 75-85-\nyear-old individuals over a 10-year\nfollow-up.\n\nThe effects of loneliness on\ncognition are evident at an even more\nfundamental level.\"' Self-regulation, or\nthe ability to regulate one’s attention,\ncognition, emotion, and/or behavior to\nbetter meet social standards or personal\ngoals, is impaired in lonely individuals.\nFor instance, among young adults,\ninstructions to shift auditory attention\nfrom the dominant right ear to the non-\ndominant left ear resulted in impaired\nperformance in lonely relative to\nnonlonely individuals. Loneliness also\nalters emotion regulation. In middle-\naged and older adults, loneliness was\nassociated with a diminished tendency to\ncapitalize on positive emotions, and this\nexplained why lonely individuals were\nless likely than nonlonely individuals to\nengage in physical activity. Impaired\ncognitive regulation is evident in\nexperimental studies that manipulate\nfeelings of isolation.
