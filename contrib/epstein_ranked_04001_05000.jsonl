The RICO claim alleged that Epstein ran an\nexpansive criminal enterprise that involved and depended upon his plane travel.\nAlthough Judge Marra dismissed the RICO claim at some point in the federal litigation,\nthe legal team representing my clients intended to pursue an appeal of that dismissal.\nMoreover, all of the subjects mentioned in the RICO claim remained relevant to other\naspects of Jane Doe’s claims against Epstein, including in particular her claim for\npunitive damages; (b) Jane Doe also filed and was proceeding to trial on a federal claim\nunder 18 U.S.C. § 2255. Section 2255 is a federal statute which (unlike other state\nstatutes) guaranteed a minimum level of recovery for Jane Doe. Proceeding under the\nstatute, however, required a “federal nexus” to the sexual assaults. Jane Doe had two\ngrounds on which to argue that such a nexus existed to her abuse by Epstein: first, his\nuse of the telephone to arrange for girls to be abused; and, second, his travel on planes\nin interstate commerce. During the course of the litigation, | anticipated that Epstein\nwould argue that Jane Dee’s proof of the federal nexus was inadequate. These fears\nwere realized when Epstein filed a summary judgment motion raising this argument. In\nrespo-nse, the other attorneys and I representing Jane Doe used the flight log evidence\nto respond to Epstein’s summary judgment motion, explaining that the flight logs\ndemonstrated that Epstein had traveled in interstate commerce for the purpose of\nfacilitating his sexual assaults. Because Epstein chose to settle the case before trial,\nJudge Marra did not rule on the summary judgment motion. (c) Jane Doe No. 102’s\ncomplaint outlined Epstein’s daily sexual exploitation and abuse of underage minors as\nyoung as 12 years old and alleged that he used his plane to transport underage females\nto be sexually abused by him and his friends. The flight logs accordingly might have\ninformation about either additional girls who were victims of Epstein’s abuse or friends\nof Epstein who may have witnessed or even participated in the abuse. Based on this\ninformation, 1 believed that the flight logs and related information was relevant\ninformation to prove the cases against Jeffrey Epstein and accordingly I pursued them\nin discovery.\n\n20. In approximately November 2009, the existence of Scott Rothstein’s Ponzi scheme\nbecame public knowledge. It was at that time that I, along with many other reputable\nattorneys at RRA, first became aware of Rothstein criminal scheme. At that time, I left\nRRA with several other RRA attorneys to form the law firm of Farmer Jaffe Weissing\n\nEdwards Fistos and Lehrman (“Farmer Jaffe”). I was thus with RRA for less than one\nyear.\n\n21. In July 2010, along with other attorneys at Farmer Jaffe and Professor Cassell, I reached\nfavorable settlement terms for my three clients L.M., E.W., and Jane Doe in their\nlawsuits against Epstein.\n\n22. On July 26, 2010, I received a letter from the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern\nDistrict of Florida — the office responsible for prosecuting Rothstein’s Ponzi scheme.\nThe letter indicated that law enforcement agencies had determined that I was “a victim\n(or potential victim)” of Scott Rothstein’s federal crimes.

US economic\ndata is forecast to stabilize and then show moderate economic growth in the second half of 2012 and into\n2013. The greater domestic sales exposure of US mid caps reduces the earnings risk coming from Europe.\n\ne In Europe, we prefer companies with a large market capitalization (large caps) over ones with a small one\n(small caps) in the current very challenging economic environment. Small caps generate more sales in\nContinental Europe than large caps. Thus, they are more negatively affected by weak domestic demand.\nSmall caps also have a more cyclical earnings exposure than large caps.\n\n¢ Globally, high-quality dividend paying stocks promise to provide a real and stable income stream to\ninvestors in the current low-yield environment. Furthermore, they give exposure to the long-term potential\nof equity markets while tending to suffer less in declining markets.\n\nA Positive scenario Prefer value, low quality and small caps\n\ne Leading indicators continue to move higher, and risks related to the Eurozone debt crisis subside. In this\ncase, add deep cyclical value (cheap price/book, price/earnings) regardless of the sector, with high beta and\nhigh leverage. In such an environment, small and mid-cap stocks should also perform well. A dividend\nstrategy would be too defensive to outperform the market.\n\n& Negative scenario Prefer quality and large caps\n\n¢ The global economic picture deteriorates markedly. In this case, buy high-quality growth companies and\nlarge caps. Do not look for value opportunities, but be as defensive as possible with your equity exposure.\nLook to high-quality, dividend-paying stocks for yield.\n\nNote: Scenarios refer to global economic scenarios (see slide 7).\n\nWhat we're watching Why it matters\n\nEarnings revisions — see\nchart\n(3-month moving\n\naverage upgrades vs.\ndowngrades)\n\nWatch for signs of improvement in earnings revisions (aggregated from stock\nlevel).

He moved onto the next stop. Same result. And the next. Same result. Eventually\nBaran’s engineering colleagues back at RAND were so affronted by the routine\ndismissal of his logic that they spoke up. They had seen the classified briefings. They\nknew just how easily the nation could be hobbled - and their Santa Monica building\nwas surely on some target list somewhere too. RAND’s scientists demanded a\ndetailed, critical study of the “distributed network model”. By the time they were\nfinished, the Air Force was preparing to begin construction.\n\nSurvivability. Plucked from that impossible looking puzzle was the first honestly\ndistributed network. You can sense the power of this inversion: A network with no\ncentral control, survivable, uncuttable. The earliest large network built on the\nBaran’s principles became known as ARPANET, the Advanced Research Project\nAgency NETwork - a mesh of connections that, even today, serves as the backbone\nfor parts of the Internet. Even with the risk of nuclear war (hopefully) long gone,\npacket switching networks of one sort or another still account for most of the data\nmoving in the world. Think of how true, how heat-hardened and useful an idea must\nbe to endure more than fifty years of technological change. And all the efficiencies\nBaran first predicted 50 years ago on his slide rules are still at work. Every time you\nmake a call, share a video or ask a machine to think for you, that whole transaction\nlikely takes place through fishnet routed packets. If we had stayed with that old\nAT&T model, we'd be living in a different world. Riots would be flipped off with a\nsingle switch. Data flows would be monitored with the ease of watching a subway\nturnstile. The far flung, wild creativity of our plug-and-play connected world would\nbe stilted, stifled. Each additional connection to the system would demand\nbureaucratic central approval by the Switch Despots, concerned more with their\nown power more than their survival. Instead, we have a slice-resistant mesh that\nhas grown by a billion times over, with its original architecture largely intact.\n\nPacket switched systems such as the Internet mean that anyone with some string\nand an ability to tie knots (which, in tech-speak, is anyone with some blinking fiber\noptics and a TCP/IP connection) can add themselves into the global web. They can\nconnect. They can share. Practically, this is why you can so easily snap your phone\nor tablet on and touch, more or less instantly, a whole world of data. Every minute\nnow an additional 10,000 devices are connected to the Internet. Medical tools,\nBitcoin mines, airplane diagnostic systems - and of course wired citizens, smart-\nphones and laptops and tablets. This ease of connection is an implicit part of a\nSeventh Sense worldview. Anyone can connect. It’s as fundamental as Luther’s “Let\nanyone can speak to God.” Or Kant’s “Dare to know.” When someone says “Why\nwould anyone want to share photos with the world?” or “Why would you ever hand\nyour DNA over?” they are missing the point that many objects now are only\ncomplete or useful once they’re connected. When we say “connection changes the\nnature of an object” we’re nodding towards the idea that constant connection is\nalmosta kind of right for devices and programs and people. Anyhow, it is certainly\na kind of yearning.\n\nWhen we described network power as stretched between distribution and\nconcentration, we should understand too that it is this design of Baran’s that\n\n82\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_018314\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

The lag between a year and its peak is partly due to the length of\nthe authorship and publication process. For instance, a book about the events of 1950 may be written\nover the period from 1950-1952 and only published in 1953.\n\nFor each year, we estimated the slope of the exponential decay shortly past its peak. The exponent was\nestimated using the slope of the curve on a logarithmic plot of frequency between the year Y+5 and the\nyear Y+25. This estimate is robust to the specific values of the interval, as long as the first value (here,\nY+5) is past the peak of Y, and the second value is in the fifty years that follow Y. The Inset in Figure 4A\nwas generated using 5 and 25. The half-life could thus be derived.\n\nHalf-life can also be estimated directly by asking how many years past the peak elapse before frequency\ndrops below half its peak value. These values are noisier, but exhibit the same trend as in Figure 4A,\nInset (not shown).\n\nTrends similar to those described here may capture more general events, such as those shown in Figure\n89.\n\nIlI.7. The Pursuit of Fame\n\nWe study the fame of individuals appearing in the biographical sections of Encyclopedia Britannica and\nWikipedia. Given the encyclopedic objective of these sources, we argue these represent comprehensive\nlists of notable individuals. Thus, from Encyclopedia Britannica and Wikipedia, we produce databases of\nall individuals born between 1800-1980, recording their full name and year of birth. We develop a method\nto identify the most common, relevant names used to refer to all individuals in our databases. This\nmethod enables us to deal with potentially complicated full names, sometimes including multiple titles and\nmiddle names. On the basis of the amount of biographical information regarding each individual, we\nresolve the ambiguity arising when multiple individuals share some part, or all, their name. Finally, using\nthe time series of the word frequency of people’s name, we compare the fame of individuals born in the\nsame year or having the same occupation.\n\nIII.7A) Complete procedure\n\n7.A.1 - Extraction of individuals appearing in Wikipedia.\n\nWikipedia is a large encyclopedic information source, with an important number of articles referring to\npeople. We identify biographical Wikipedia articles through the DBPedia engine (Ref $9), a relational\ndatabase created by extensively parsing Wikipedia. For our purposes, the most relevant component of\nDBPedia is the “Categories” relational database.\n\nWikipedia categories are structural entities which unite articles related to a specific topic. The DBPedia\n“Categories” database includes, for all articles within Wikipedia, a complete listing of the categories of\nwhich this article is a member. As an example, the article for Albert Einstein\n(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Einstein) is a member of 73 categories, including “German physicists”,\n“American physicists”, “Violonists”, “People from Ulm” and “1879_births”. Likewise, the article for Joseph\nHeller (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph Heller) is a member of 23 categories, including “Russian-\n\nAmerican Jews”, “American novelists”, “Catch-22” and “1923 _births’.\n\nWe recognize articles referring to non-fictional people by their membership in a “year_births” category.\nThe category “1879 births” includes Albert Einstein, Wallace Stevens and Leon Trotsky likewise\n“1923 births” includes Henry Kissinger, Maria Callas and Joseph Heller while “1931_births” includes\nMichael Gorbachev, Raul Castro and Rupert Murdoch.

The Christian\nwho believes God is his or her creator is\ntherefore confident that God continues to\nwork for his or her ultimate good, that\nGod is engaged in the effort to increase\nit, whatever the impediments in human\nlife suggesting the contrary, absent, that\nis, almost any confirming evidence.\n\nThe Problem of Inattention\n\nAlthough invisibility and\napparent absence do not pose the same\nproblem here as they do when God is\none’s friend, this rather more impersonal\nunderstanding of God’s influence as\ncreator and sustainer has its own\nproblem maintaining a strong sense of\nconnection to God. The diffuseness of\ninfluence that lies behind God’s constant\ninvisible presence can prompt simple\nChristian inattention to God. The very\nmonotony of the always pertinent\nChristian affirmation that everything is\nto be attributed to God can make that\naffirmation recede from focal awareness,\nmake it fail to come focally to mind.\nBelief in God’s uniform presence would\nthereby become functionally\nindistinguishable from the sense of\nGod’s absence.

Such a\nGod has little to offer as a “para-social”\nentity, as a factor fomenting or\nsupplementing a sense of social\nconnection.\n\nIn the back of their minds\nChristians may believe that God is the\nsource of everything, but they may not\nfeel compelled to consider that fact\nactively in the course of their everyday\nlives. God hides behind, so to speak, all\nthe creaturely influences that God is\nworking through, which become matters\nof primary Christian preoccupation. At\nthe center of attention are all the\nordinary influences and connections with\none’s natural and human environments;\npreoccupation with them pushes out of\nfocal awareness the fact of God as the\nultimate source of them all. Apart from\nspecifically religious obligations—say,\nthe demand to give God thanks and\npraise at times of worship—Christians\nwho believe God is their creator would\nhave no particular reason to dwell on\nthat fact.\n\nChristian theologians commonly\ntie this sort of practical worry--about\nwhat from a Christian point of view\namounts to sinful neglect of one’s\nconnection to God--to the understanding\nof double agency in the account of\ncreation I sketched above.“ According\nto that account, it is true, God’s\ninfluence on human life does not have to\ngo by way of the human and natural\ncausal powers and influences on human\nlife that God creates; God can influence\nhuman life without producing sufficient\ncreated causes for what God wants to\nhappen in human life.

The Church was merely one of\nmany institutions that had sat massively, reliably, comfortably (and greedily)\nbetween people and power.\n\nLuther, it later emerged, was not alone. An era of awkward answers had begun. The\nPrussian astronomer Nicolaus Copernicus, for instance, had preceded Luther by a\ncouple of decades with his own questioning of the unquestionable. “Those who\nknow that the consensus of many centuries has sanctioned the idea that the earth\nremains at rest while the heavens move around it would regard it as an insane\npronouncement if I said the opposite,” he wrote. Machiavelli, Galileo, Erasmus, a\ngrowing list of great, transformative names - they were all working away in this\nsame questioning spirit. Their insane pronouncements, when proven true, opened\nthe way to still further insights. The Enlightenment had begun. The old power\ncenters acted almost as if nothing had changed; maybe they believed nothing would\never need to. “What was, still is,” the Catholic Church pronounced confidently (and\nabsurdly) at the Council of Trent in response to Luther’s Reformation. But there was\nno turning back. As the German philosopher Immanuel Kant wrote, the motto of the\nera could best be summarized as: Dare to know! “The Enlightenment,” he explained,\n“requires nothing but freedom.”\n\nThis, it emerged, was a hell of an expensive requirement.\n4.\n\nIn the years after Luther’s 95 Theses, Europe was torn apart. The continent’s\nlongstanding image of power - balled up, concentrated, unquestioned - was ripped\naway. Another picture emerged. The idea of personal access to God, a kind of “one\nman, one prayer” approach to religion, which opened in turn other fundamental\nstruggles. The credibility of nearly every sacred body that had once depended on\ncontrolling people and limiting their choices - the Church, those kings, feudalism,\nmyths - faced a creeping erosion. “Human knowledge and human power come to the\nsame thing,” the English philosopher and statesman Francis Bacon observed in the\nmidst of this shift in his artillery shell of a book The New Organum. Human\nknowledge, he means, is human power. You can imagine the energy, the promise of\nthe book as it was passed in Latin copy to Kepler in his study in Linz (then Lintz), to\nGallileo in Venice a decade before his imprisonment. It was this same human power\nto question even the most sacred ideas that the masses of Enlightenment Europe\nwould use, gleefully at times, to claw apart most of the old structures.??

Create fame cohorts for individuals with the same occupation.\ni. Use most famous 20\" year, ranking on the basis of the 20\" best year in the\nterms of fame for the individual.\n\nIII.7B. Cohorts of fame\n\nFor each year, we defined a cohort of the top 50 most famous individuals born that year. Individual fame\nwas measured in this case by the average frequency over all years after one's birth. We can compute\ncohorts on the basis of names from Wikipedia, or Encyclopedia Britannica. In Figure 5, we used cohorts\ncomputed with names from Wikipedia.\n\nAt each time point, we defined the frequency of the cohort as the median value of the frequencies of all\nindividuals in the cohort.\n\nFor each cohort, we define:\n\n(1) Age of initial celebrity. This is the first age when the cohort's frequency is greater than 10-9. This\ncorresponds to the point at which the median individual in the cohort enter the \"English lexicon\" as\ndefined in the first section of the paper.\n\n(2) Age of peak celebrity. This is the first age when the cohort's frequency is greater than 95% of its peak\nvalue. This definition is meant to diminish the noise that exists on the exact position of the peak value of\nthe cohort's frequency.\n\n(3) Doubling time of fame. We compute the exponential rate at which fame increases between the ‘age of\nfame' and the 'age of peak fame’. To do so, we fit an exponential to the timeseries with the methods of\nleast squares. The doubling time is derived from the estimated exponent.\n\n(4) Half-life of fame. We compute the exponential rate at which fame decreases past the year at which it\nreaches its peak (which is later than the \"age of peak celebrity\" as defined above). To do so, we fit an\nexponential to the timeseries with the methods of least squares. The half-life is derived from the\nestimated exponent.\n\nWe show the way these parameters change with the cohort’s year of birth in Figure $13.\n\nThe dynamics of these quantities is sensibly the same when using cohorts from Wikipedia or from\nEncyclopedia Britannica. However, Britannica features fewer individuals in their cohorts, and therefore the\ncohorts from the early 49\" century are much noisier. We show in Figure $14 the fame analysis\nconducted with cohorts from Britannica, restricting our analysis to the years 1840-1950.\n\nIn Figure 5E, we analyze the trade-offs between early celebrity and overall fame as a function of\noccupation. For each occupation, we select the top 25 most famous individuals born between 1800 and\n1920. For each occupation, we define the contour within which all points are close to at least 2 member of\nthe cohort (it is the contour of the density map created by the cohort).\n\n25\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_017033\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

Following in the\nfootsteps of the equities market, Mr. Callahan expects the fixed income ETF market\nto grow significantly and be very impactful to the overall market structure.\n\n= Greater concern around speed at which liquidity can change vs. liquidity in the\nmarket. There is a lot of concern around liquidity in fixed income markets. That\nsaid, Mr. Brown is more concerned with the speed at which liquidity can change.\nThere has been growing evidence that the market is going to adjust greater and\nfaster than the underlying fundamental reasons for the correction. As such, this is\ncausing participants to revisit how they look at risk management. Now market\nparticipants need to take into account not only their behavior, but their reaction to\nother participants’ behavior (i.e. contagion effect).\n\n= Fewer, well-established platforms reduce overall risk within system.

Using the government\nbond market as an example, Mr. Olesky points out that the growing contribution\nfrom PTFs to the overall treasury trade volume has increased the risk outside the\nprimary-dealer system.

As a Bok Fellow this year, and alongside Bok director Rob Lue in\nthe years to come, | will be working to substantially expand Bok's capacity and resources to train\nhumanists in 21st-century methods of public engagement-- developing courses, digital fellowship\nopportunities and also securing distribution outlets and partners for content produced in Bok by\nHarvard humanists. By next year at this time, | will be turning some of my attention beyond poetry\n(my favorite, but hardly the only humanistic mode of communication!) to create a wider base of\nhumanities materials for use in American schools and other institutions. We will begin integrating and\nanchoring Poetry in America content (on art, sport and play; on the environment; and on health and\nwell being) with content created by others. As | continue to experiment with use of digital media\nwithin my residential courses for undergraduates and graduates, | shall also be working with other\nfaculty and graduate students. My work at Bok will also facilitate collaborations between humanists\nworking across the whole university. Projects for 2017 include work with HarvardX on drama and\nShakespeare, with Harvard’s Center for the Environment, with the Arts and Humanities Initiative at\nHarvard Medical School, and with several programs within Harvard’s Graduate School of Education.\n\nLaunching in 2017: Our First Course Designed Specifically for Teachers\n\nVerse Video Education has allocated much of its staff time this year to bringing its first course\ndesigned specifically to support the American secondary classroom to completion. Poetry in America\nfor Teachers: The City from Whitman to Hip Hop draws on assets created at HarvardX, along with\nfootage captured with our TV partners and independently by Verse Video Education. The resulting\ncourse, designed for English, Social Studies, and Arts teachers, as well as for librarians,\nadministrators and others, provides deep content instruction as well as pedagogical training.\nCommon Core aligned, this course, the first of its kind, is now open for enrollment, and will launch\nJanuary 23rd. We are currently discussing group enrollments with major educational systems and\nreformers across the nation, and we are also raising scholarship funds for strapped enrollees. Over\ntime, we hope to play a leading role in improving literacy and in strengthening the humanities across\nthe American educational landscape.\n\nAiring Nationwide in 2018: Poetry in America, The Television Series\nIn May 2016, Verse Video Education was asked by WGBH and American Public Television to\nexpand its television series in development from 8 to 13 episodes, listed below.\n\nThe following episodes are entering post-production:\n\nOn Edward Hirsch’s “Fast Break”: Shaquille O'Neal, Pau Gasol, Shane Battier, Edward Hirsch,\nand an on-court pick-up basketball chorus filmed at Success Academy Charter School; On W.H.\nAuden’s “Musee Des Beaux Arts”: Ambassador Samantha Power, David Brooks, Peter Sacks; On\nRobert Hayden’s “Those Winter Sundays”: Vice President Joe Biden, Elizabeth Alexander,\nAngela Duckworth, Kevin Young, and a chorus of fathers and sons; On Carl Sandburg’s\n“Skyscraper”: Frank Gehry, Robert Polito, and a chorus of Young Student Poets; On Nas’s “New\nYork State of Mind”: Nas, Russell Simmons, Salamishah Tillet, Steve Stoute, and a chorus of hip\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_019331\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

In August, the Cabinet approved\nan economic stimulus package totaling JPY28trn (roughly 5.5% of GDP). Though “real\nwater” government spending is a comparatively modest JPY7.5trn (1.5% of GDP}, this is\nenough to put the fiscal impulse back in expansionary territory, after three years of\ntightening (Chart 10). The stimulus measures, which are centered on public investment\nand cash transfers to households, should boost CY2017 GDP by O.5ppt. Public\nconstruction orders are already rebounding as the government front-loaded public\ninfrastructure spending (Chart 11). Meanwhile, the next stage of the consumption tax\nincrease has been postponed until October 2019.\n\nChart 10: After 3 years of tightening, fiscal policy to turn loose in FY17\n2.5\n2.0\n1.5\n1.0\n0.5\n0.0\n\n0.5\n-1.0\n\nContractionary\n\nForecasts 5\n\nExpansionary\nFY10 FY11 FY12 FY13 FY14 FY1Sf FY16f FYI7f\nm Fiscal impulse (change in cyclically-adjusted primary balance), % GDP\n\nSource: BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research, IMF, CAO\n\nTo be clear, we are not talking about massive shifts in the fiscal stance here—the\nMinistry of Finance remains very much opposed to expanding the deficit and Prime\nMinister Abe has yet to abandon the government’s long-standing goal of balancing the\nprimary balance by FY2020.\n\nHowever, there is a growing consensus among Japanese policymakers that premature\nfiscal tightening is counter-productive for reflation efforts, especially when monetary\npolicy is stretched. Even Bo) Governor Kuroda, who initially underplayed the risks from\n2014 fiscal tightening, has recently acknowledged that loose monetary and fiscal\npolicies will have a “synergistic effect.” The upshot is that the risk of another policy\nerror is low, in our view. If anything, we see upside risks from greater fiscal stimulus in\nthe form of a third supplementary budget or relatively aggressive FY17 ordinary budget.\nWe would not rule out further delays to the October 2019 consumption tax hike, either.\n\nChart 11: Public investment is poised to pick up in the months ahead\n30\n20\n10\n0\n-10\n\n-20\n2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016\n\n= Public construction orders received %YoY 3mma\n=—=Public construction orders completed %YoY 3mma\n\nSource: BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research, MITI\n\nBankof America >\n4 Japan Economics Viewpoint | 18 November 2016 Merrill Lynch\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_014413\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

Examples would include:\n\ne Banking Organizations:\n\n© ABN Amro: In December 2005, ABN Amro was assessed an $80 million Civil Money Penalty (CMP) for\nfailure to implement an adequate system of internal controls reasonably designed to assure compliance\nwith U.S. AML laws and regulations. The CMP cited deficiencies within the North American Regional\nClearing Center (NARCC), a unit within the New York Branch of ABN Amro that operated as a clearing\ncenter for funds transfers in U.S. dollars for members within the ABN Amro network and more than 400\nthird-party financial institutions. Specific findings included the following:\n\n« Failure to staff the compliance function and train compliance personnel adequately\n= Failure to file accurate and timely Suspicious Activity Reports (SARs)\n\n= Lack of formal procedures for collecting and reviewing due diligence and assessing the risks of\nforeign financial institutions accessing correspondent banking services\n\n= Lack of adequate monitoring of funds transfers for potentially suspicious activity, particularly\nfunds transfers conducted by financial institutions independent of the ABN Amro network\n\n« Failure to incorporate information on subjects of previous SAR filings, terminated relationships,\nand publicly available information on shell companies into its suspicious activity monitoring\nprogram\n\n» Failure to investigate alerts and utilize the capabilities of its automated monitoring software to\nmanage its money laundering and terrorist financing risk effectively\n\no American Express: !n August 2007, American Express International Bank (AEIB) was issued a Cease\nand Desist (C&D) order and assessed a $20 million CMP and $55 million forfeiture. American Express\nTravel Related Services Co. (AETRSC) also was assessed a $5 million CMP. Cross-border payment\nmade total effective charges, including forfeiture, $65 million. AEIB provided private banking services to\nhigh net worth clients and AETRSC operated as a money services business (MSB). Specific findings\nincluded the following:\n\n» Failure to implement comprehensive customer due diligence (CDD) and enhanced due\ndiligence (EDD) processes\n\n= Failure to implement effective control measures for bearer shares and other private investment\ncompanies (PICs)\n\n» Failure to adhere to the internal policies for periodic reviews of high-risk accounts\n# Inadequate transaction monitoring system due to data integrity and other problems\n= Inadequate independent testing of the AML Compliance Program\n\n« Failure to provide adequate oversight of and accountability for the AML Compliance Program\nby management of AEIB and its parent company, AEB\n\no Wachovia: In March 2010, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), FinCEN and the U.S.\nDepartment of Justice (DOJ) announced that Wachovia Bank, N.A., had agreed to a Deferred\nProsecution Agreement with a forfeiture of $110 million with the DOJ, a civil money penalty of $50\nmillion, a C&D with the OCC, and a civil money penalty (CMP) of $110 million with FinCEN. FinCEN\nagreed its CMP would be satisfied by the payment of the DOJ forfeiture.

But one of the initial moments that really impressed me about my current\nboyfriend was when I asked him, many moons ago, if he knew what a safeword is. He\npaused, then answered, \"I think I'm familiar with the idea, but I probably don't know\nmuch more than a stereotype, so I'd like to hear you define it.\" Humility and open-minded\ncuriosity are so incredibly hot!\n\nRighto. Hot boyfriend aside, I'm here to explain safewords and check-ins, and how those\nconcepts can exemplify excellent sexual communication for everyone -- not just S&Mers\n-- ina world that doesn't do a good job teaching anyone how to communicate sexually.\n\nWhen two (or more) people have a BDSM encounter together, generally they set a\nsafeword -- a word that anyone can say at any time to stop the action. (Sometimes people\ndon't use safewords. This is their choice and I totally respect it. I would not recommend\ngoing without safewords for anyone who doesn't know their partner extremely well, and\nI would be seriously sketched out by anyone who pressured a partner to go without\nsafewords.)\n\nThomas MacAulay Millar:\n\nA word on origin: safewords are only strictly necessary in one circumstance -- where the\nparticipants want words like \"no\" and \"stop\" not to have their ordinary meaning. One can\ndo BDSM for a lifetime without a safeword, if words have their ordinary meanings. As\nformer porn star and kinkster Ona Zee once put it (I'm quoting an interview from memory\nhere), \"our safeword is 'that hurts.\"\" Folks can even do heavy play depending on how they\nreact to things, without a safeword, simply saying \"stop\" or \"too much” or \"fuck, I can't\nhandle any more of that!\" when the play gets too intense. Any BDSMer who would tell\nyou URDOINITRONG if you use ordinary words to communicate in scene is not\nsomeone you need to listen to.\n\nSafewords are essential for roleplay where \"no, please don't, I'll do anything!\" should not\nstop the action. It's also essential for any bottom who will involuntarily shout \"No! Stop!\"\nwhile actually wanting more. Other than that, it's an optional tool -- a very, very useful\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_018466\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

If the court finds that the number of victims makes it impracticable to accord all of the victims the right\nto be present, the court shall fashion a reasonable procedure to facilitate victims’ attendance.\n\n(d) Right To Be Heard on Victims’ Issues. In addition to rights to be heard established elsewhere in these rules, at any public\nproceeding at which a victim has the right to attend, the victim has the right to be heard on any matter directly affecting a\nvictim's right.\n\nThe Rationale:\n\nThe rules should reflect the CVRA's command that victims have the right to attend public proceedings in all but the most\nunusual circumstances. The CVRA guarantees victims the right to attend a proceeding “unless the court, after recetving clear\nand convincing evidence, determines that testimony by the victim would be materially altered if the victim heard other\ntestimony at that proceeding.\" 777 This is a fundamental right for victims. A crime is often a very significant event in the life of\na victim, and the trial, too, may be extremely important. Victims deserve to see in person whether justice is being done and\nshould be exempted from the rule requiring trial witnesses to sit outside the courtroom. 7/8 The CVRA adopts this approach by\n\nallowing crime victims, in the vast majority of cases, to attend the hearings and trial of the case involving their victimization.\nThis is so important because crime victims share an interest with the [*906] government in seeing that justice is done in a\ncriminal case and this interest supports the idea that victims should not be excluded from public criminal proceedings, whether\n\nthese are pretrial, trial, or post-trial proceedings. 77°\n\nMost states have also adopted language affirming a victim's right to attend court proceedings, including the trial. 75°\n\nOne way of addressing the victim's right to attend would be to leave the matter to the Federal Rules of Evidence. Federal Rule\nof Evidence 615 - the so-called \"rule on witnesses\" - requires exclusion of witnesses with certain exceptions, including the\n\nfourth exception for \"a person authorized by statute to be present.\" 75!

Specifically, prosecutors consider\nwhether the company made a voluntary and timely dis-\nclosure as well as the company’s willingness to provide rel-\nevant information and evidence and identify relevant actors\ninside and outside the company, including senior execu-\ntives. In addition, prosecutors may consider a company’s\nremedial actions, including efforts to improve an existing\ncompliance program or appropriate disciplining of wrong-\ndoers.*? A company’s remedial measures should be mean-\ningful and illustrate its recognition of the seriousness of the\nmisconduct, for example, by taking steps to implement the\npersonnel, operational, and organizational changes neces-\nsary to establish an awareness among employees that crimi-\nnal conduct will not be tolerated.?*\n\nThe Principles of Federal Prosecution similarly provide\n\nthat prosecutors may consider an individual’s willingness\n\nGuiding Principles\nof Enforcement\n\nto cooperate in deciding whether a prosecution should\nbe undertaken and how it should be resolved. Although a\nwillingness to cooperate will not, by itself, generally relieve\na person of criminal liability, it may be given “serious con-\nsideration” in evaluating whether to enter into a plea agree-\nment with a defendant, depending on the nature and value\nof the cooperation offered”\n\nThe US. Sentencing Guidelines similarly take into\naccount an individual defendant’s cooperation and volun-\ntary disclosure. Under § 5K1.1, a defendant’s cooperation,\nif sufficiently substantial, may justify the government filing\na motion for a reduced sentence. And under § 5K2.16, a\ndefendant’s voluntary disclosure of an offense prior to its\ndiscovery—if the offense was unlikely to have been discov-\nered otherwise—may warrant a downward departure in\ncertain circumstances.\n\nChapter 8 of the Sentencing Guidelines, which gov-\nerns the sentencing of organizations, takes into account an\norganization’s remediation as part of an “effective compli-\nance and ethics program.” One of the seven elements of\nsuch a program provides that after the detection of crimi-\nnal conduct, “the organization shall take reasonable steps\nto respond appropriately to the criminal conduct and to\nprevent further similar criminal conduct, including mak-\ning any necessary modifications to the organization’s\ncompliance and ethics program.” Having an effective\ncompliance and ethics program may lead to a three-point\nreduction in an organization’s culpability score under\n§ 8C2.5, which affects the fine calculation under the\nGuidelines. Similarly, an organization’s self-reporting,\ncooperation, and acceptance of responsibility may lead to\nfine reductions under § 8C2.5(g) by decreasing the culpa-\nbility score. Conversely, an organization will not qualify\nfor the compliance program reduction when it unreason-\n\nably delayed reporting the offense.” Similar to § 5K1.1\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_022556\n\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

Our panelists included Lee\nOlesky (co-founder and CEO of Tradeweb), Adam Brown (Head of US Rates\nElectronic Trading at BofAML) and Brian Callahan (Head of US Par Loan Trading\nand the head of Electronic Initiatives for Global Credit and Special Situations at\nBofAML).\n\n= Electronification of fixed Income markets steadily growing; however, lag\nEuropean market. Electronic trading came to fixed income trading in the late\n1990’s as a way of automating transactions (i.e. create a more efficient process\nbetween parties}. Today in the US, the investment grade market is 16-20%\nelectronic, the high yield market is 8% (has doubled over the last few of years), the\ntreasury market (which has been growing steadily over last 10-15yrs) is 80-90% of\nthe actual trade count is electronic. While the electronification of the derivative\nmarket was slower to evolve, recent regulatory reform has accelerated the\nelectronification process (50% today}. That said, while the evolution towards\nelectronification in the US continues to grow, the European bond market is actually\nmore advanced with nearly 50% of the bond market automated (vs. 20% for the\nUS).\n\n= Regardless of possible regulatory relief, electronification may slow but won’t\nend entirely. While a partial repeal or lightening of Dodd-Frank would be a net\npositive for the financial markets, and possibly lower the costs to banks and end-\nusers, Mr. Brown doesn’t see a dramatic effect on the market structure. In other\nwords, regulatory relief may only slow down the electronification progress.\n\n= Electronification within the fixed income market is a modest priority among\nasset managers. Fifty-two percent (52%) of the audience polled believe it to be a\nmodest priority in their own corporate strategy to embrace new\ntechnologies/electronification in fixed income. Mr. Brown was not surprised by the\nresults as many of the asset managers have their own constraints from technology\nfunding to regulatory issues to running the day-to-day business.

You could read that line, after all, very personally and see what it\ndemanded next: My realm, my religion.\n\nIn a sense, this revolutionary tumult was necessary to pull power froma\ncomfortable, established asymmetric arrangement, in which a few people controlled\nso much, and into something more symmetric. Luther’s Reformation thinking made\nGod directly, instantly accessible to anyone. (Just as Copernicus’ scientific way of\nthinking gave us, eventually, the ability to question if God existed at all.) Individuals\n— and the very birth of the idea of individualism was another heretical slap at the old\ninstitutions - could balance and contend and argue as equals. The notion that men\nwere “created equal” became increasingly evident in this generation, even as\nestablishing that equality triggered the French Revolution, the American Civil War\nand countless similar conflicts. Democratic systems aspired to enshrine this new\nbalance, shifting countries from rule-by-birth to rule-by-majorities. In economics,\nmarkets reflected the new picture of power too. How good is that product? What is\nthe price? Is there demand? became the essential questions, not Which Lord controls\nthat field. Releasing power into the busy arms of businessmen, politicians, scientists\nand artists meant ideas, politics and innovations contended one against the other.\nThey got better. They evolved. And the sum of all these interacting pieces made\nsustained economic growth into a reality for the first time in history. Ina\n“commercial society,” Adam Smith explained in The Wealth of Nations, “Every man\nlives by exchanging, or becomes in some measure a merchant.” Smith didn’t mean\neveryone was really a merchant, rather that in a world of markets each of us - our\nlabor, our ideas, our capital - is a commodity. We are liberated, but only to compete.\nFor votes, for jobs, for resources.\n\nIf the old faiths and institutions couldn't stand the pressures of these powerful,\nequalizing forces, then new ones had to be built. “The scaffolds humans erect,” the\nNobel prize-winning economist Douglass North called these foundations.> The idea\nof equality of influence or power - not merely opportunity - demanded new\ncontainers: voting booths, congresses, unions. Rule of law was one of the most\nurgently essential: a single code that could be laid down evenly across a society,\ndemanding that principles of order outweighed the habitual advantages of\nprominence or power or birth. Law aspired to make men equal in front of courts.\nThis, in turn, suggested a new degree of fairness up and down the social order.\nBroader literacy, the standardization of measurements or the birth of universal\ncredit and currencies were all tools for spreading access.

But\npart and parcel of the account of creation\nis the suggestion that God ordinarily\ninfluences human life by bringing about\nthe very natural and human influences\nthat shape it. In general, because God\ninfluences the world as its creator, God’s\nworking does not begin where created\ncauses break off; God works, instead, in\nand through the created causes that God\nbrings about. Christians are therefore\nable to give a double account of most\nhappenings in the world: one that\ndiscusses what has happened in terms of\nthe coordinated created powers and\nactivities sufficient to explain it within\nthe created order; and one that talks\nabout God’s creative activity in bringing\nabout those same coordinated created\npowers, activities, and their\nconsequences in their totality. It is the\nsufficiency of the explanation in terms of\ncreated causes—the self-containment of\nthat explanation within its own order—\nthat allows human beings to attend to the\ncreated order without taking into account\nthe relationship of dependence upon God\nthat is its presupposition.\n\nThe temptation to lapse into\nhabitual obliviousness of one’s\nrelationship with God is easily\ncountered, however, by other beliefs\nabout God that Christians hold.\nChristians do not just believe that God is\nthe creator and sustainer of the universe,\nbut believe a lot of other things about\nGod. For example, the common\nChristian belief that God acts as more\nthan a creator in individual lives helps to\ncounter obliviousness to God. God does\nnot merely act as creator by giving\nindividuals the created gifts that make\nthem what they are—for example, their\nown capacities and operations, the\nability to influence and be influenced by\ntheir human and natural environments,\n\n125\n\nPage\n\nand so on. God also acts to give them\nGod’s very presence—by way, for\nexample, of their relationship with Christ\nwho Christians believe is God in human\nflesh. The very presence of God in\nhuman life means one’s relationship\nwith God cannot be ignored. The created\ncauses and influences, through which\nGod also influences human life,\nconsequently no longer have the same\ncapacity to distract human attention from\nGod.\n\nChristians often believe,\nmoreover, that God’s direction of human\nlife by way of God’s own presence to or\nwithin it is no optional matter: God’s\npresence forms an essential component\nof human life. In addition to created\ncapacities and influences brought about\nby God, God’s presence is necessary for\nordinary human capacities to operate as\nthey should.“ To be morally good, for\nexample, requires not just virtuous\ncapacities of one’s own, given to one by\nGod, but the presence of the Holy Spirit\nwithin one. Knowing well requires not\njust the formation of good ideas through\nthe usual human processes of\ninvestigating one’s environment—the\nentirety of which has its source in a good\ncreator God--but also a mind informed\nby the very Word of God. And so on.\n\nSuch beliefs imply that attention\nto God’s presence, some sort of God-\ndirectedness, should be a constant\nfeature of an individual’s everyday,\nordinary life, in order for that life to be\nlived well. The individual Christian is\naccordingly given a reason to bring to\nmind his or her relationship with God,\nmotivated to attend to that relationship\nas much as possible, indeed, in the effort\nto lead a better life.

Also, at a later AAAS conference, again in 2008, for which she had asked, and for\nwhich | had written her a letter of recommendation to attend, my wife and | gave her a lift in our taxi well out out of our way in order to\ndrop her off at her hotel, and | note in an email response to her email about the conference, agin in 2008, | expressed that | would\npass her regards along to my wife and vice versa.

When | spoke to the human resources person, including relating my concerns and providing the emails in question, | was\ntold that no formal complaint of sexual harassment was deemed at that time to be called for, and that the young woman in question\nhad agreed to that.

Because | was already in Arizona at the time | was asked\nnot to have any further interaction with the student | agreed to that request, both to respect her sensitivities and also because it was\nbasically moot because | was not on campus. | was also told that because it was being handled informally, that (a) it should remain\nconfidential, which |, at least abided by, and (b) if no further complaints were lodged in that case, that the University would remove the\ncomplaint from my record after 5 years, which makes me surprised that someone violated that written agreement with you.\n\nRe item 6: You report on ASU’s response to item #6 , without including the fact that the University specifically stated there were never\nany allegations of sexual misconduct or harassment by me at the University, and morever the outside complaints were in fact related\nspecifically to your item #6. Further you neglect to mention that this complaint was by an anonymous third party, not the individual\nwho was allegedly harassed, who never lodged a complaint, and that no specific evidence was provided of the alleged\n\ntransgression. | was surprised and dismayed that both ASU and ANU launched investigations on the basis of this but was told by both\nUniversities that because of my high profile even such unsubstantiated third party complaints at private events unrelated to the\nUniversity would be investigated. The complaint was investigated throughly by both ASU and ANU and both came to the conclusion\nthat it was not credible and no university policies had been violated. . In addition ANU’s investigation, which took a full month found\nsignificant inconsistencies in the allegation, suggesting distortion and fabrication, | will quote from the ANU report. The initial\ncomplaint, which in fact resulted in a temporary suspension of my position at ANU, until it was dismissed, outlined the claim you made\nin the words you quoted in your note to me, but it also stated\n\n\"It is the University’s understanding that a complaint was lodged directly to the conference organisers at the time of the incident.”\nAfter the month-long investigation, during which | was told | was not to interact with anyone on campus (again moot because | was a\nhemisphere removed) the final report absolved me of any wrongdoing, and indicated information inconsistent with the original claim\n\nand apparent later claims as follows in the report, from which | quote:\n\n\"The allegations were made by an observer to the incident.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_021417\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

Specifically, the report\nidentifies four broad measures of a company’s cooperation:\n\ne self-policing prior to the discovery of the miscon-\nduct, including establishing effective compliance\nprocedures and an appropriate tone at the top;\n\ne self-reporting of misconduct when it is discovered,\nincluding conducting a thorough review of the\nnature, extent, origins, and consequences of the mis-\nconduct, and promptly, completely, and effectively\ndisclosing the misconduct to the public, to regula-\ntory agencies, and to self regulatory organizations;\n\ne remediation, including dismissing or appropriately\ndisciplining wrongdoers, modifying and improv-\ning internal controls and procedures to prevent\nrecurrence of the misconduct, and appropriately\ncompensating those adversely affected; and\n\n* cooperation with law enforcement authorities,\nincluding providing SEC staff with all informa-\ntion relevant to the underlying violations and the\ncompany’s remedial efforts.\n\nSince every enforcement matter is different, this ana-\n\nlytical framework sets forth general principles but does not\n\n55\n\nnection with enforcement actions.\n\nSEC’s Framework for Evaluating Cooperation by\n\nIndividuals\n\nIn 2010, SEC announced a new cooperation program\n\nfor individuals.” SEC staff has a wide range of tools to\n\nfacilitate and reward cooperation by individuals, from tak-\n\ning no enforcement action to pursuing reduced sanctions in\n\nconnection with enforcement actions. Although the evalu-\n\nation of cooperation depends on the specific circumstances,\n\nSEC generally evaluates four factors to determine whether,\n\nto what extent, and in what manner to credit cooperation\n\nby individuals:\n\nthe assistance provided by the cooperating indi-\nvidual in SEC’s investigation or related enforce-\nment actions, including, among other things: the\nvalue and timeliness of the cooperation, including\nwhether the individual was the first to report the\nmisconduct to SEC or to offer his or her coopera-\ntion; whether the investigation was initiated based\nupon the information or other cooperation by the\nindividual; the quality of the cooperation, includ-\ning whether the individual was truthful and the\ncooperation was complete; the time and resources\nconserved as a result of the individual's coopera-\ntion; and the nature of the cooperation, such as the\ntype of assistance provided;\n\nthe importance of the matter in which the indi-\nvidual provided cooperation;\n\nthe societal interest in ensuring that the cooperat-\ning individual is held accountable for his or her\nmisconduct, including the severity of the individ-\nual’s misconduct, the culpability of the individual,\nand the efforts undertaken by the individual to\n\nremediate the harm; and\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_022557\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

There are some expectations that even in 2020\nwe will be less than 30%. A public debt of 30% does not mean a problem, some of the countries in the\nworld have GDB in some of them up to 50%, some up to 60% and some up to 200%, including G20\ncountries. If we look at the big countries, the five major economies have more than 30% public debt. So\nthat, it is healthy for the Saudi economy to involve a percent of public debt, which means that we have\nopportunities for development programs on which we spend money.

Too many assets have been entered, some of which may have been reviewed\nor announced to the public investment fund. These will be reflected in the size of the fund, the\nsize of the value of the fund, and the profits of the fund.\n\n2- We have heard that some of the reserves that are not of the state's funds need to be transferred\nto the public investment fund, about 100 billion riyals several months ago. Also, there is a\nrestructuring of the public investment fund companies so that their performance, growth and\nprofits are better than the previous. All of these will maximize the size of the Public Investment\nFund, on top of this the offer of Saudi Aramco.\n\n* His Highness the prince, What about Aramco?\n\n- As we state, the most important offer in the Public Investment Fund is the ARAMCO offer. This will\nprovide huge sums to the Public Investment Fund and also it will help in targeting many sectors inside\nand outside Saudi Arabia. One of the most important sectors to be targeted by the Fund within Saudi\nArabia, is the mining sector. According to the survey of the 1970s, which was re-examined last year, |\nthink there are mining opportunities of (Trillion and three hundred billion US dollars). The value of\nminerals in Saudi Arabia, of which gold is more than 240 billion US dollars and that requires a very huge\ninvestment. It is always difficult for foreign and domestic investors to take risks in a new sector such as\nmining. Consequently, the investment should be through the Public Investment Fund. The company of\nAramco contribution with part of the money (cash) in the fund will provide the Fund with the ability to\ninvest in this new sector, which has now only utilized less than 3%, and we have another very important\ngoal which is the local content target. Today's volume of Saudi Arabia purchases outside the Kingdom of\nSaudi Arabia on goods, commodities, activities or so on, amounting to US $ 230 billion. According to the\nvision of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia 2030, half of this spending will be within the Kingdom, and when\nwe talk about what are the most important local content items (S 230 billion), the most important item\nis Military manufacturing, which ranges from $ 50 to S$ 70 billion a year, sometimes increases,\nsometimes less.

Changing the rule in this fashion\nwould also clarify the appropriate sequencing of sentencing hearings. Rule 32(i) already allows the victim to submit \"any\ninformation\" about the sentencing. 77° Yet if the experience in my court is any guide, the victim's allocution frequently occurs\nonly after the court has decided all the issues surrounding the presentence report. For the victim's right to provide information\nto the court to truly have meaning, the victim's information must be presented early enough to potentially affect critical\nsentencing issues, including issues about Guidelines calculations.\n\nAs with the changes discussed in the previous section, changes in the Sentencing Guidelines Manual are also required here. The\nAdvisory Committee also should coordinate with the Sentencing Commission to ensure that its actions are consistent.\n\nRule 32()(4) - Conforming Amendment to Victims’ Right To Be Heard\nThe Proposal:\nRule 32(1)(4) should be amended to conform the definition of victim to that found in the CVRA as follows:\n\n(B) By a Victim. Before imposing sentence, the court must address any victim of a the crime of violence or sexual abuse who is\npresent at sentencing and must permit the victim to speak or submit any information about the sentence. Whether or not the\nvictim is [*904] present, a victim's right to address the court may be exercised by the following persons if present:\n\n(i) a parent or legal guardian, if the victim is younger than 18 years or is incompetent; or\n(i1) one or more family members or relatives the court designates, if the victim is deceased or incapacitated.\nThe Rationale:\n\nAs noted earlier, 77° Rule 32 currently contains a definition of \"victim\" that is narrower than the CVRA's definition. The\n\nsimplest fix is simply to strike the definition of victim and victim's representative here and include an appropriate definition in\nRule 1.\n\n(New) Rule 43.1 - Victim's Right To Attend Trials\n\nThe Proposal:\n\nA new rule implementing the victim's right to be present at trials and other proceedings should be added as follows:\nRule 43.1 Victim's Presence\n\n(a) Victim's Right To Attend. A victim has the right to attend any public court proceeding, unless the court, after receiving clear\nand convincing evidence, determines that testimony by the victim would be materially altered if the victim heard other\ntestimony at that proceeding. Before making any determination to exclude a victim, the court shall make every effort to permit\nthe fullest attendance possible by the victim and shall consider reasonable alternatives to the exclusion of the victim from the\ncriminal proceeding. The reasons for any decision to exclude a victim shall be clearly stated on the record.\n\n(b) Proceeding With and Without Notice. The court may proceed with a public proceeding without a victim if proper notice has\nbeen provided to that victim under Rule 10.1. The court may proceed with a public proceeding (other than a trial or sentencing)\n\n274 Td,\n\n275, Fed. R. Crim.

Clarisse mentioned that some people \"don't use safewords.\" From\nthe context, she's talking not about people for whom no means no in scene, but people for\nwhom there is no definitive way for the bottom to stop the scene. And perhaps readers\ncan tell from Clarisse's tone that that's... the advanced class. You'll find the safety police\nin any BDSM space or community that finger-wag about it, and the swaggering more-\nkinky-than-thous that brag about it. But what does it mean?\n\nI can only tell you what it means for me. There are times I give up my safeword: only to\nmy spouse. We've been playing together for about a decade and a half. If I give up my\nsafeword, and that's something we do rarely, it doesn't mean I don't have limits. I have\nlimits! Yes I do! There are things I can't handle, mentally or physically, and things I\nnever want to handle! There are \"hard limits,\" things I've said I'm just not willing to do.\nAnd there are soft limits, things I don't think I'm ready for but I'm willing to bump up\nagainst them and see what happens. If I give up my safeword, it means I have limits, but\ninstead of telling her when I've reached them, I'm going to trust her to listen to me and\nwatch me and make that decision. I may say, \"I can't, I can't, I can't,\" and she may decide\nI really can't. Or she may decide I've got more in me than I believe I do. There's a lot of\nrisk associated with that. But there's a trust in those moments and a closeness that does\nnot go away when the scene is over. Or ever, really. Risk and reward: we set our own\ntolerances.\n\nSome folks may have come across the term \"consensual nonconsent.\" It's one of those\nterms with multiple meanings. Some people use it to describe any situation where the\nbottom is saying \"no, don't\" but has not yet safeworded -- a usage I find less than useful.\nOthers use it to describe roleplays of nonconsensual situations. The last common usage,\nthough, is that which I like to describe using Hunter S. Thompson's phrase, \"buy the\nticket, take the ride.” It means that the bottom consents to be in a situation I've just\ndescribed, where the top decides if the bottom needs to stop, often but not always around\nspecific activities, and usually (wisely) heavily negotiated.\n\nClarisse Thorn:\nWhen I give advice about setting safewords, I usually offer the following:\n\nA) Some people like to say that it's good to use a safeword that's jolting, and is likely to\nmake your partner feel totally unsexy. Isn't there a Family Guy episode in which Lois &\nPeter's safeword is \"banana\" or something?\n\nThomas MacAulay Millar:\n\nNot a fan. The more obscure a safeword, the harder it is for a bottom who is spacey or\nflying on endorphins to access it. It's easy to remember \"banana\" in the calm before the\nstorm. At the moment when it's most needed, that can easily become a muddle of\n\"yellow? was it a fruit? Shit, what do I do?\" That's not a place bottoms want to find\nthemselves and a top never, never, never wants to have a bottom who is at a limit but\ncan't communicate about it.\n\nClarisse Thorn:\n\nB) In my experience, the generally accepted safewords in the S&M community are\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_018467\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

In return, the CFPB,\nupon request, will provide reports on the results of its investigations or examinations and statistical information related\nto any inquiries to assist FinCEN in understanding and analyzing the value of BSA information.\n\nEnforcement Actions\n\n27. What types of enforcement actions are available to regulators for addressing AML\nCompliance Program deficiencies and violations?\n\nRegulators have a range of enforcement tools available to address AML Compliance Program deficiencies and\nviolations of AML laws and regulations.\n\nWhile enforcement actions against nonbanks have increased in recent years, the number of enforcement actions\nissued by bank regulators continues to outnumber those of other agencies, at least in the United States. Examples of\nenforcement actions available to U.S. bank regulators in order of severity are:\n\ne Commitment Letter: A Commitment Letter is an agreement between a bank's board of directors and a bank\nregulator in which the board, on behalf of a bank, agrees to take certain actions to address issues or concerns\nsurfaced by the regulator. A Commitment Letter is not legally binding, but the failure of a bank to live up to the\nterms of the Commitment Letter may subject the bank to more formal regulatory action.\n\ne Memorandum of Understanding: A Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) is an agreement between a bank's\nboard of directors and one or more regulatory agencies. The content of an MOU may be similar or identical to\nmore formal enforcement actions, but MOUs are nonpublic documents and, similar to Commitment Letters, not\nlegally binding.\n\ne Formal Agreements: A Formal Agreement is an agreement between a bank's board of directors and one or\nmore regulatory agencies. While the contents of a Formal Agreement may mirror those of an MOU, violations of\na Formal Agreement can provide the legal basis for assessing civil money penalties (CMPs) against directors,\nofficers and other institution-affiliated parties.\n\ne Consent Order or Order to Cease and Desist (C&D): Consent Orders and Orders to Cease and Desist are\nagreements between a bank's board of directors and one or more regulatory agencies. Violations of a Formal\nAgreement can provide the legal basis for assessing civil money penalties (CMPs) against directors, officers and\nother institution-affiliated parties. The regulator's decision to issue a Consent Order or Order to Cease and Desist\nrather than a formal agreement is based on its assessment of the severity of the bank’s problems.\n\n* Civil Money Penalties (CMPs): Civil money penalties are financial penalties that may be imposed by a regulator\nagainst a bank or an individual(s) for a violation of law or regulation or noncompliance with a formal enforcement\naction.\n\ne “Death Penalty”: Under the Annunzio-Wiley Act of 1992, bank regulators have the option — in fact, are obligated\nto consider — whether the license/charter of a depository institution that is found guilty or pleads guilty to money\nlaundering charges should be revoked. The revocation of a license/charter is known as the “Death Penalty.”\n\nUnlike the formal enforcement actions issued by bank regulators, which are usually very prescriptive as to the actions\nthat must be taken to address the identified deficiencies, the enforcement actions taken by securities and\nfutures/commodities regulators generally report findings that detail the nature of the deficiency, but do not prescribe\nspecific corrective action (and accompanying fines have been modest compared to those levied against banks).\n\n28. Does FinCEN have enforcement authority?\n\nFinCEN does have enforcement action authority, which it often uses in conjunction with a financial institution's\nfunctional regulators.\n\n29. Beyond the actions and penalties that may be imposed by regulators, are U.S.\ncompanies subject to any other potential actions?\nYes. Other actions, such as Deferred Prosecution Agreements (DPA), may result from legal actions.\n\nprotiviti | 20\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_024126\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

We are bullish on all three factors and see\nCY17 core inflation running at an above-consensus 1.0% and 1.4% in CY18.\n\nThis is still short of the central bank’s 2% target (Chart 7). But we believe there will be\nlittle pressure to lower rates further, especially against the backdrop of a weakening yen\nand rising global yields. More broadly, things are moving in the right direction for the\nBo). The private sector has been steadily re-leveraging, albeit gradually. Meanwhile,\nlabor markets continue to tighten and wage growth is slowly improving: the 4-quarter\nmoving average for hourly wages is now up to 1.2% y-o-y (Chart 8). With the labor\nmarket for lower-cost part-time workers nearing saturation, growth in higher-quality,\nfull-time jobs is picking up (Chart 9). We expect a moderation in employment gains and\n\nfaster wage growth ahead.\n\nChart 6: Produce and consumer price inflation (ex-tax effect)\n\n4 1.0\n2 0.5\n0 0.0\n-2 0.5\n4 -1.0\n-6 -1.5\n\n2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016\n\n—— Corporate goods prices %YoY (LHS)\n——Headline CPI %YoY (LHS)\n== Corporate service prices %YoY (RHS)\n\nSource: BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research, MIA\n\nChart 8: Wage growth is picking up on the back of tight labor markets\n\nChart 7: Japan-style core inflation (CPI ex fresh food) forecasts (FY basis)\n\n2.0\n1.0\n0.0\n-1.0\n\n-2.0\n2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018\n\nBoJ BofAML\n\nConsensus —= —= Target\n\nSource: BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research, Bo), JCER *Consensus is JCER ESP survey\n\nChart 9: Full-time job growth is accelerating\n\n2\n1\n0\n\n'\nNR\n\n2000 2002 2004 2006 2008 2010 2012 2014 2016\n\n——Hourly wages, %YoY 4qtr ma\n\n== US-style core inflation (ex-tax), %YoY 4qtr ma\nSource: BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research, MHLW, MIA\n\n3.0 Abenomics\n2.0\n1.0\n0.0\n-1.0\n-2.0\n-3.0\n\n2000 2002 2004 2006 2008 2010 20121 2014 2016\n\nmae Part-time, ppt contribution moe Full-time, ppt contribution\n—— Total employment, %YoY\n\nSource: BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research, MIA\n\nBankof America\nMerrill Lynch\n\nJapan Economics Viewpoint | 18 November 2016 3\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_014412\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

After all, over the past half century, Arabs from the\nMaghreb to the Persian Gulf experienced epochal social, economic,\ntechnological and demographic transformation: it was only the\npolitics that lagged behind. And while good autocrats there were, the\nreigning model was sterile and decadent national-security regimes,\ndeeply corrupt and with sultanic tendencies. These leaders sought to\nperpetuate their rule through offspring: sons who had not risen\nthrough the military or other bureaucracies, and thus had no\nlegitimacy. Marcus Aurelius was one thing; Tunisia’s Zine el-\nAbidine Ben Ali, Egypt’s Hosni Mubarak and Syria’s Bashar al-\nAssad, quite another. Certainly, the Arab Spring has proved much:\nthat there is no otherness to Arab civilization, that Arabs yearn for\nuniversal values just as members of other societies do. But as to\ndifficult questions regarding the evolution of political order and\ndemocracy, it has in actuality proved very little. To wit, no good\nautocrats were overthrown. The regimes that have fallen so far had\nfew saving graces in any larger moral or philosophical sense, and the\nwonder is how they lasted as long as they did, even as their\ntumultuous demise was sudden and unexpected. Yet, the issues\nabout which Mill and Berlin cared so passionately must still be\naddressed. For in some places in the Arab world, and particularly in\nAsia, there have been autocrats who can, in fact, be spoken of in the\nsame breath as Marcus Aurelius. So at what point is it right or\npractical to oust these rulers? It is quite possible to force through\npolitical change, which leads, contrary to aims, into a more deeply\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_032194\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

Growing fast, in 2016 we more firmly established Verse Video Education as a nimble\nand stable producer of humanities-based content (now including an archive of over 120 separate\ninterviews with distinguished discussants), while also defining a forward-looking partnership and\ngrowth strategy with Harvard.

My premise is\nthat while native intelligence is certainly genetic, the perception of\nintelligence and what might be described as intelligent behavior can\nbe altered. (Perhaps this seems as incoherent a position as Miss South\nCarolina’s position on education.)\n\nThe curious thing about her second response is that it doesn’t\nanswer the original question at all. The question was about why she\nthought Americans were ignorant about geography, and she respond-\ned by saying that they weren’t but that maybe there should be more\neducation about reading maps, which in no way addresses the ques-\ntion about why Americans can’t locate the United States on a map.\n\nSo her answer is still awful even after she was given time to work\non it. It is simply unintelligent.\n\nThe question is: Could we make Miss South Carolina more intel-\nligent somehow? Clearly school hasn’t done it. (She was an honor\nstudent!) How might one do it?\n\nOf course, we really aren’t concerned with Miss South Carolina\nin particular. Consider the following interviews conducted at a Sarah\nPalin book signing in November 2009, in Columbus, Ohio.

Payments were made in ways that obscured their\npurpose and the ultimate recipients of the money. In some\ncases, employees obtained large amounts of cash from cash\ndesks and then transported the cash in suitcases across inter-\nnational borders. Authorizations for some payments were\nplaced on sticky notes and later removed to avoid any perma-\nnent record. The company made payments totaling approxi-\nmately $1.36 billion through various mechanisms, including\n$805.5 million as bribes and $554.5 million for unknown\npurposes.” The company was charged with internal controls\nand books and records violations, along with anti-bribery\nviolations, and paid over $1.6 billion to resolve the case with\nauthorities in the United States and Germany.”\n\nThe types of internal control failures identified in the\nabove example exist in many other cases where companies\nwere charged with internal controls violations.” A 2010\ncase against a multi-national automobile manufacturer\ninvolved bribery that occurred over a long period of time in\nmultiple countries.’** In that case, the company used doz-\nens of ledger accounts, known internally as “internal third\nparty accounts,’ to maintain credit balances for the ben-\nefit of government officials.” The accounts were funded\nthrough several bogus pricing mechanisms, such as “price\nsurcharges,’ “price inclusions, or excessive commissions.”*°\nThe company also used artificial discounts or rebates on\nsales contracts to generate the money to pay the bribes.””!\nThe bribes also were made through phony sales intermedi-\naries and corrupt business partners, as well as through the\nuse of cash desks.” Sales executives would obtain cash from\nthe company in amounts as high as hundreds of thousands\nof dollars, enabling the company to obscure the purpose\nand recipients of the money paid to government officials.”\nIn addition to bribery charges, the company was charged\nwith internal controls and books and records violations.\n\nGood internal controls can prevent not only FCPA\nviolations, but also other illegal or unethical conduct by the\ncompany, its subsidiaries, and its employees. DOJ and SEC\nhave repeatedly brought FCPA cases that also involved\n\nother types of misconduct, such as financial fraud,’\n\n235 6\n\ncommercial bribery,’ export controls violations,” and\n\nembezzlement or self-dealing by company employees.”\n\nPotential Reporting and Anti-Fraud Violations\n\nIssuers have reporting obligations under Section\n13(a) of the Exchange Act, which requires issuers to file\nan annual report that contains comprehensive information\nabout the issuer. Failure to properly disclose material infor-\nmation about the issuer’s business, including material rev-\nenue, expenses, profits, assets, or liabilities related to bribery\nof foreign government officials, may give rise to anti-fraud\nand reporting violations under Sections 10(b) and 13(a) of\nthe Exchange Act.\n\nFor example, a California-based technology company\nwas charged with reporting violations, in addition to viola-\ntions of the FCPA’s anti-bribery and accounting provisions,\nwhen its bribery scheme led to material misstatements in its\nSEC filings.” The company was awarded contracts procured\nthrough bribery of Chinese officials that generated material\nrevenue and profits. The revenue and profits helped the com-\npany offset losses incurred to develop new products expected\nto become the company’s future source of revenue growth.\nThe company improperly recorded the bribe payments as\nsales commission expenses in its books and records.\n\nCompanies engaged in bribery may also be engaged\nin activity that violates the anti-fraud and reporting provi-\nsions. For example, an oil and gas pipeline company and\nits employees engaged in a long-running scheme to use the\ncompany’s petty cash accounts in Nigeria to make a vari-\nety of corrupt payments to Nigerian tax and court officials\nusing false invoices.’” The company and its employees also\nengaged in a fraudulent scheme to minimize the company’s\ntax obligations in Bolivia by using false invoices to claim\nfalse offsets to its value-added tax obligations. The scheme\nresulted in material overstatements of the company’s net\nincome in the company’s financial statements, which vio-\nlated the Exchange Act’s anti-fraud and reporting provi-\nsions.

Yet, while administration officials talk frequently\nabout China in domestic contexts, the president’s policy toward\nBeijing is fundamentally incoherent.\n\nTwo recent books, Henry Kissinger’s On China and Aaron\nFriedberg’s A Contest for Supremacy: China, America, and the\nStruggle for Mastery in Asia, suggest two very different\ninterpretations of Chinese conduct and propose alternative American\nresponses. Kissinger views China as a rising but thus far moderate\npower and warns against creating a self-fulfilling prophecy that could\nlead to zero-sum competition between Beijing and Washington. He\nargues that such rivalry could lead to a pre-World War I situation\nwith potentially devastating consequences for both nations and for\nthe rest of the world. Friedberg ridicules this approach, arguing that\nthe United States should seek to democratize China and, if this does\nnot succeed, should practice assertive containment. In his view, if the\nWorld War I analogy has any value, it is in demonstrating that the\nBritish were too timid in responding to Germany’s rise.\n\nKissinger and Friedberg offer coherent proposals that are mutually\nexclusive. Kissinger’s is much more persuasive to me, but there is a\nchoice—and America must make a decision. Accordingly, it is quite\ntroubling to see the Obama administration trying to have it both\nways: building a cooperative relationship with Being while visibly\nsiding with China’s neighbors in every dispute.

Rev. 835, *879\n\nThis change helps to implement a victim's right under the CVRA to be treated \"with fairness.\" 19° The rule change is modest.\nRule 18 already requires the court to consider the convenience of the \"witnesses\" in a case. In many cases, of course, the victim\nwill be a witness. But for clarity in those cases, and to account for cases in which the victim will not be a witness, the rule\nshould be amended to refer specifically to victims.\n\nRule 20 - Victims’ Views Considered Regarding Consensual Transfer\nThe Proposal:\nRule 20 should be amended to allow the court to consider the victims' views in any decision to transfer a case as follows:\n\n(a) Consent to Transfer. A prosecution may be transferred from the district where the indictment or information is pending, or\nfrom which a warrant on a complaint has been issued, to the district where the defendant is arrested, held, or present if:\n\n(1) the defendant states in writing a wish to plead guilty or nolo contendere and to waive trial in the district where the\nindictment, information, or complaint is pending, consents in writing to the court's disposing of the case in the transferee\ndistrict, and files the statement in the transferee district; and\n\n(2) the United States attorneys in both districts approve the transfer in writing after consultation with any victim. If any victim\nobjects to the transfer, the United States attorney in the transferring district or the victim's attorney shall advise the court where\nthe indictment or information is pending of the victim's concerns.\n\nA similar change should be made to Rule 20(d) regarding transfer of juvenile proceedings.\n[*880]\nThe Rationale:\n\nAs with the previous proposal, this change implements the victim's right under the CVRA to be \"treated with fairness.\" 197\n\nThe procedure for transferring a case for a plea is not constitutionally required, but rather is designed for the convenience of the\ndefendant and the government. !°8 In considering whether such administrative reasons justify a transfer, the concerns of the\nvictim appropriately enter into the balance. For reasons similar to those discussed above in connection with changes regarding\n\nplea procedures, the prosecution would be directed to confer with the victim and to advise the court of any objection to the\n\ntransfer. 199\n\nRule 21 - Victims’ Views Considered Regarding Transfer for Prejudice\nThe Proposal:\nRule 21 should be amended as follows to require consideration of the victim's interest in whether a case should be transferred:\n\n(ec) Victims! Views. The court shall not transfer any proceeding without giving any victim an opportunity to be heard. The court\nshall consider the views of the victim in making any transfer decision.\n\nThe Rationale:\n\nRule 21 authorizes the trial judge to transfer a case to avoid prejudice or for the convenience of the parties. The proposed rule\nwould require that the court consider the victim's concerns in making any such transfer decision. Such consideration would\nseem to be part and parcel of protecting the victim's right to be \"treated with fairness.\" In addition, the vicinage provision of\n\n196 18 U.S.C.A. 3771(a)(8) (West 2004 & Supp. 2005).\n197 Td. 3771 (a)(8).\n198 See generally Wright, Federal Practice and Procedure 321, at 357-58.\n\n199 See supra notes 158-174 and accompanying text.\n\nDAVID SCHOEN\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_017740\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

He opened his leather jacket.\nHe pulled out a pistol and started to approach us. “in breirah,” I whispered to\nAmiram. “No choice.” To this day, I remember the shock on the man’s face as\nhe watched us — a pair of 30something women — open our jackets and pull out\nUzis. Fortunately for him, we’d had to make allowances for concealment in\nchoosing our weapons. We’d left the Uzis’ stabilizing shoulder braces behind.\nAs our first shots hit, he had half-turned to run. Though wounded, he somehow\ngot back in the car. We kept shooting but he managed to drag himself out of the\nfar door and roll behind a waist-high wall on the other side of the street. One of\nour shots obviously hit the electrical innards of the Renault, because the car\nhorn began blaring full-blast, as if someone had set off a modern-day car alarm.\nSo much for the element of surprise.\n\nI saw three sets of lights suddenly come on in the otherwise dark apartment\nbuildings.

Whatever rain dance the Fed is doing to\nkeep inflation low, they better keep doing it.\n\nA chart I saw on the history of jobless claims (below, left) was meant to show how good things may get. In the prior 3 business\ncycles, when continuing claims fell through 2.2% of the labor force (1982, 1993, 2003), it was a great time to add risk in\nportfolios. Improving claims signaled that the business cycle was picking up enough steam to be self-sustaining, and last week,\nthe US crossed through this barrier again. But as Big Bird used to say, one of these things is not like the other: the US\nprimary budget deficit which supports this recovery is a bigger now. So, the US economy better improve markedly in order\nto pay the freight. When will this chart on the primary deficit (below, right) matter to financial markets? Only when it becomes\na binding constraint, either due to a lack of demand to finance the deficit at current yields, or due to the economic cost of closing\nit. The timing is uncertain, given Central Bank purchases of Treasury bonds, and a Congress which may leave the problem for\nanother day (or generation). I lose a lot of sleep over this, but I don’t know a lot of other people that do. As discussed last\nweek, portfolio allocations given today’s private and public sector realities vary substantially across wealth management firms.\nOurs rely on hedge funds, credit and real estate as complements to public and private equity.\n\nIn past cycles, claims were a great market signal Paging Dick Cheney: Do Deficits Matter?\nContinuing claims asa % of labor force Deficit ex-interest, percentof GDP, seasonally adjusted\n5.0% 8\n45% 6\n4.0% i\n3.5% 0\n3.0% -2\n25% “4\n2.0% 6\n< 0 -8\n1.5% 10\n1.0% -12\n1967 1972 1977 1982 1987 1992 1997 2002 2007 2012 1954 1967 1981 1995 2008\n\nSource: DepartmentofLabor, BLS, Empirical Research Partners.

After adjusting for better weather, the Lehman shock and other factors, payroll growth does not look quite as good as reported, but\nis still positive. The trend is supported by the latest Manpower surveys, Institute for Supply Management surveys, JOLTS surveys, etc, all of\nwhich show growing demand for labor. Even state and local government firmg has finally come to an end, which was a constant fixture of\nthe last two years. So far, hourly earnings remain very weak, and typically do not grow until later in the cycle.\n\n° The latest US bank stress tests were pretty stressful. Two-year loss assumptions applied by the Fed were higher than those experienced\nduring 2008 and 2009, and comparable in almost every category to realized losses during the Great Depression. Almost every institution\npassed the test, and even the ones that didn’t are expected to reach required capital levels in short order. US banks have sharply reduced\nreliance on “hot money” (time deposits, commercial paper and repo), relying instead on core retail deposits to finance their balance sheets.\nComparing the rigor of US and European bank stress tests is like comparing the rigors of actual football to Wii football.\n\n> So far, net household borrowing other than student loans is weak; loan growth is almost exclusively from companies rather than households.\n\n1\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_024132\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

Verb frequencies\n\nNext, for each verb, we computed the frequency of the regular past tense (built by suffixation of ‘-ed’ at\nthe end of the verb), and the frequency of the irregular past tense (summing preterit and past participle).\nThese trajectories are represented in Fig 3A and Fig S8.\n\nWe define the regularity of a verb: at any given point in time, the regularity of a verb is the percentage of\npast tense usage made using the regular version. Therefore, in a given year, the regularity of a verb is\nr=R/(R+l) where R is the number of times the regular past tense was used, and | the number of times the\nirregular past tense was used. The regularity is a continuous variable that ranges between 0 and 1\n(100%).\n\nWe plot in Figure 3B the mean regularity between 1800-1825 in x-axis, and the mean regularity between\n1975-2000 in y-axis.\n\nIf we assume that a speaker of the English language uses only one of the two variants (regular or\nirregular); and that all speakers of English are equally likely to use the verb; then the regularity translates\ndirectly into percentage of the population of speakers using the regular form. While these assumptions\nmay not hold generally, they provide a convenient way of estimating the prevalence of a certain word in\nthe population of English speakers (or writers).\n\nIII.5C. Rates of regularization\n\nWe can compute, for any verb, the slope of regularity as a function of time: this can be interpreted as the\nvariation in percentage of the population of English speakers using the regular form.\n\nBy holding population size constant over the time window used to obtain the slope, we derive the\nvariation of population using the regular form in absolute terms.\n\nFor instance, the regularity of “sneak/snuck” has decreased from 100% to 50% over the past 50 years,\nwhich is 1% per year. We consider the population of US English speakers to be roughly 300 million. As a\nresult, snuck is sneaking in at a speed of 3 million speakers per year, or about one speaker per minute in\nthe US.\n\nIII.5D. Classification of Verbs\n\nThe verbs were classified into different types based on the phonetic pattern they represented using the\nclassification of Ref 18 (main text). Fig 3C shows the median regularity for the verbs ‘burn’, ‘spoil’, ‘dwell’,\n‘learn’, ‘smell’, ‘spill’ in each year. We compute the UK rate as above, using 60 million for UK population.\n\nIII.6. Collective Memory\n\nOne hundred timelines were generated, for every year between 1875 and 1975. Amplitude for each plot\nwas measured by either computing ‘peak height’ — i.e., the maximum of all the plotted values, or ‘area-\nunder-the curve’ — j.e., the sum of all the plotted values. The peak for year X always occurred within a\n\n18\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_017026\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

These lines of connection run two ways, of course:\nNetworks permit any of us to connect to nearly anywhere, and to unimaginable\ntechnological power. But, at the same time, the world connects back to us. Wired\njihadis and currencies and bio bits - they’re all tied in with us too. So yes: We’re\nmurdering the exotic with our data connections and machines and discount plane\nflights. Should we be surprised when, from time to time now, the exotic shows up\nand murders us right back?\n\nWe've seen, now, the way in which that pulling connection between center and\nperiphery - that tension of our network - pulls apart old structures. And this is the\nfirst, urgent Seventh Sense understanding: Connection changes the nature of an\nobject by placing it on this tense mesh. Connect a patient, a doctor, a flying machine,\na currency - each is twisted and changed as a result. Some become great. Others\nsnap, never to be rebuilt. Some adjust, painfully. The pulling network action\naccounts for our greatest new fortunes but also the tumbling of old ideas and\ninstitutions. This is why our age is so uneasy. This is also part of the picture of\nnetwork power we have to keep in mind, the image of a stretched skein plucking\napart old structures. Baran’s fishnet grows, it locks everything it touches into anew\nstructure, one that resists the “arrest the usual suspects” sort of interruption. We’ve\nsaid: Connection changes the nature of an object. To be connected to a Baran-style\nsystem instead of a brush-cut 1950’s AT&T system makes a difference.\n\nThe connected devices themselves are constantly improving. Back in Baran’s day,\ndozens of scientists counted themselves lucky to share a single computer. A few\ndecades later, the PC revolution gave everyone their own machine. And now, of\ncourse, we each have many computers in our lives: phones, wired TVs, computers.\nBecause of connection, we have access to thousands of such devices in data\ncenters.1°7 We can touch them in an instant, a fusion of software and hardware and\nconnection that we are starting to know lean on as “everyware.” This now\ncommonplace magic was formalized back in 1965 by Gordon Moore, one of the\nfounding engineers at Intel, who noticed the rather amazing fact that since the\nintroduction of integrated chips in 1959, the number of transistors on each tiny chip\nhad been doubling every two years.!°8 It seemed hard to imagine this pace could\nendure, but then it did and does, something known as Moore’s Law. Back in 1997\nAndy Grove, who followed Moore as CEO of Intel, the chip giant, was named TIME’s\nMan of the Year.

However, as Gary\nBerntson and Louise Hawkley have\ndiscussed, beliefs can affect our health\neven to the extent of determining life\nand death. As Tanya Luhrmann\ndiscusses, in some forms of Christianity,\nthere is a real belief in the presence of\nGod. This is not simply a belief of God\nin the world, but a belief of a God who is\nby one’s side. The idea of God as a\nfriend and companion clearly motivates\nthe desire to make such a presence\nmanifest in tangible ways. For some, it is\nthe sense of God with which they\ncommune, for others it is what they\nbelieve to be a sensory experience of\nGod that they seek. Luhrmann outlines\nhow this belief, coupled with a\nsupportive social structure, can lead to\npowerful personal experiences, such as\nhearing the voice of God, reflecting the\noperation of our social brains.\n\nOur sense of social connection is\nnot dependent on a single set of religious\nbeliefs, however. In human social\nconnections, we can form individual\nrelationships with a spouse or friends\nbut, as John Cacioppo outlined, there are\nother kinds of connections that our social\nbrain seeks, as well. We seek\nconnections with emergent structures\nsuch as groups, clubs, teams,\ncongregations, and beyond. Kathryn\nTanner argues that the belief that God\ncreated the world and bears causal\nresponsibility for it serves to connect\nbelievers to life in a broader way than is\nprovided through individual\nrelationships. This broader connection to\nlife does not depend on the manifestation\nof a presence to whom we can talk\nbecause the evidence of social\n\nPage |119\n\nconnection is apparent in the very fabric\nof daily existence. Thus, whereas\nLuhrmann discusses God as a palpable\nfriend that one can learn to attend to and\nexperience as an active presence in one’s\nlife, Tanner discusses God as the\ninitiator of life and the very fabric of\nexistence, a presence so ubiquitous that\nthere is no specific point on which one\ncan focus to attend to or experience God.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_021365\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

Yet if the IRS lacks sufficient funds to do its job properly,\nthat means fewer dollars all around for all federal programs, including national defense, Social Security and\nMedicare — and for reducing the deficit. Perhaps, as Ms. Olson suggests, Congress should change the way\nit approaches the IRS’s budget and fund the IRS at whatever level Congress believes will “maximize tax\ncompliance, particularly voluntary compliance, with due regard for protecting taxpayer rights and minimizing\ntaxpayer burden.”\n\nChanges afoot in New York?\n\nOn January 21, 2014, New York’s Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D) introduced his comprehensive Executive Budget\nfor New York’s 2014-2015 fiscal year. The budget has a number of tax reform proposals, including\n“modernizing” New York’s estate tax law and closing what it refers to as the resident trust “loophole.” Here\nare a few highlights of this draft legislation:\n\ne Estate Tax. For decedents dying on or after April 1, 2014, New York would begin lowering its top estate\ntax rate of 16% (this currently applies to taxable estates just over $10 million), and increasing its $1\nmillion estate tax exclusion amount; by April 1, 2017, the top estate tax rate would have dropped to 10%,\nand the exclusion amount would have reached $5.25 million. As of January 1, 2019, that exclusion\namount would be indexed for inflation using the “cost of living adjustment,” defined as the percentage by\nwhich the consumer price index (CPI) for 2018 exceeds the CPI for 2012; as of January 1, 2020, the\ncost of living adjustment would be the percentage by which the CPI for 2019 exceeds the 2018 CPI; in\n2021, the adjustment would be the percentage by which the 2020 CPI exceeds the 2018 CPI, and so\nforth, in subsequent years. In addition, as of April 1, 2014, resident New York decedents would have to\ninclude “adjusted taxable gifts” (see below) made on or after that date in their New York gross estates if\nthey were New York residents when they made the gifts; non-resident New York decedents would not\ninclude such gifts in their New York taxable estates unless the gifts were of real or tangible property\nlocated in New York, or of intangible property used in a New York trade or business.\n\nComments. The memorandum in support of this legislation states that New York’s estate tax is\n“woefully out of date,” and that it gives wealthy New Yorkers an incentive to leave the state. In part, the\nlegislation would address this problem by lowering New York’s estate tax rate, and eventually raising its\nestate tax exclusion to the federal basic exclusion amount, which it cites as $5.25 million, indexed for\ninflation. Indeed, thanks to inflation-indexing, the basic exclusion amount was $5.25 million in 2013, and\nin 2014, it is $5.34 million — meaning that in 2014, a married couple can protect up to $10.68 million from\nfederal gift or estate tax, assuming they haven’t made any prior gifts that used up some of this exclusion\n(these are the “adjusted taxable gifts” referred to above). Thus, New York’s draft legislation targets a\nnumber ($5.25 million) that is already stale. Nevertheless, the legislation would start indexing the New\nYork exclusion for inflation as of 2019; presumably, its CPI references would successfully match New\nYork’s exclusion to whatever the federal exclusion then is.\n\nIn addition, including certain lifetime gifts made on or after April 1, 2014 in the New York estate tax\ncomputation could definitely increase a decedent’s New York estate tax, which generally doesn’t reflect\nthose gifts. It goes without saying that a New Yorker currently contemplating a significant lifetime gift\nmight want to complete that gift prior to April 1, 2014, given this draft legislation. But New Yorkers who\nhaven't yet made such gifts might be reluctant to do so — they may not want to, and may not even be a\nNew York resident at death.\n\ne The resident trust “loophole.” The memorandum in support of this legislation explains that it would\nmake two “improvements” to the taxation of trusts. First, it would tax distributions of trust income\naccumulated in prior years (“accumulation distributions”) to New York beneficiaries of non-resident trusts\n(generally, trusts created by someone who was not a New Yorker) and of tax-exempt resident trusts\n(generally, trusts created by a New Yorker that are exempt from New York income tax because they\n\nTax Topics 01/29/14 3\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_019442\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

His investigation is tainted by the bias that \nattended its origin in 2016. \nBy \nDavid B. Rivkin Jr. and \nElizabeth Price Foley \nJune 22, 2018 6:38 p.m. ET \n414  COMMENTS \nSpecial counsel Robert Mueller's investigation may face a serious legal obstacle: It is tainted by \nantecedent political bias. The June 14 report from Michael Horowitz, the Justice Department's \ninspector general, unearthed a pattern of anti-Trump bias by high-ranking officials at the Federal \nBureau of Investigation. Some of their communications, the report says, were \"not only indicative of a \nbiased state of mind but imply a willingness to take action to impact a presidential candidate's electoral \nprospects.\" Although Mr. Horowitz could not definitively ascertain whether this bias \"directly \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 026273 \naffected\" specific FBI actions in the Hillary Clinton email investigation, it nonetheless affects the \nlegality of the Trump-Russia collusion inquiry, code-named Crossfire Hurricane. \nCrossfire was launched only months before the 2016 election. Its FBI progenitors—the same ones who \nhad investigated Mrs. Clinton—deployed at least one informant to probe Trump campaign advisers, \nobtained Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court wiretap warrants, issued national security letters to \ngather records, and unmasked the identities of campaign officials who were surveilled. They also \nrepeatedly leaked investigative information. \nMr. Horowitz is separately scrutinizing Crossfire and isn't expected to finish for months. But the \ncurrent report reveals that FBI officials displayed not merely an appearance of bias against Donald \nTrump, but animus bordering on hatred. Peter Strzok, who led both the Clinton and Trump \ninvestigations, confidently assuaged a colleague's fear that Mr. Trump would become president: \"No \nhe won't. We'll stop it.\" An unnamed FBI lawyer assigned to Crossfire told a colleague he was \n\"devastated\" and \"numb\" after Mr. Trump won, while declaring to another FBI attorney: \"Viva le \nresistance.\" \nThe report highlights the FBI's failure to act promptly upon discovering that Anthony Weiner's laptop \ncontained thousands of Mrs. Clinton's emails. Investigators justified the delay by citing the \"higher \npriority\" of Crossfire. But Mr. Horowitz writes: \"We did not have confidence that Strzok's decision to \nprioritize the Russia investigation over following up on [the] investigative lead discovered on the \nWeiner laptop was free from bias.\" \nSimilarly, although Mr. Horowitz found no evidence that then-FBI Director James Comey was trying \nto influence the election, Mr. Comey did make decisions based on political considerations. He told the \ninspector general that his election-eve decision to reopen the Clinton email investigation was motivated \nby a desire to protect her assumed presidency's legitimacy. \nThe inspector general wrote that Mr. Strzok's text messages \"created the appearance that investigative \ndecisions were impacted by bias or improper considerations.\" The report adds, importantly, that \"most \nof the text messages raising such questions pertained to the Russia investigation.\" Given how biases \nineluctably shape behavior, these facts create a strong inference that by squelching the Clinton \ninvestigation and building a narrative of Trump-Russia collusion, a group of government officials \nsought to bolster Mrs. Clinton's electoral chances and, if the unthinkable happened, obtain an insurance \npolicy to cripple the Trump administration with accusations of illegitimacy. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 026274 \nWhat does this have to do with Mr. Mueller, who was appointed in May 2017 after President Trump \nfired Mr. Comey? The inspector general concludes that the pervasive bias \"cast a cloud over the FBI \ninvestigations to which these employees were assigned,\" including Crossfire. And if Crossfire was \npolitically motivated, then its culmination, the appointment of a special counsel, inherited the taint. All \nspecial-counsel activities—investigations, plea deals, subpoenas, reports, indictments and \nconvictions—are fruit of a poisonous tree, byproducts of a violation of due process. That Mr. Mueller \nand his staff had nothing to do with Crossfire's origin offers no cure. \nWhen the government deprives a person of life, liberty or property, it is required to use fundamentally \nfair processes. The Supreme Court has made clear that when governmental action \"shocks the \nconscience,\" it violates due process. Such conduct includes investigative or prosecutorial efforts that \nappear, under the totality of the circumstances, to be motivated by corruption, bias or entrapment. \nIn U.S. v. Russell (1973), the justices observed: \"We may someday be presented with a situation in \nwhich the conduct of law enforcement agents is so outrageous that due process principles would \nabsolutely bar the government from invoking judicial processes to obtain a conviction.\" It didn't take \nlong. In Blackledge v. Perry (1974), the court concluded that due process was offended by a \nprosecutor's \"realistic likelihood of 'vindictiveness' \" that tainted the \"very initiation of proceedings.\" \nIn Young v. U.S. ex rel. Vuitton (1987), the justices held that because prosecutors have \"power to \nemploy the full machinery of the state in scrutinizing any given individual. . . we must have assurance \nthat those who would wield this power will be guided solely by their sense of public responsibility for \nthe attainment of justice.\" Prosecutors must be \"disinterested\" and make \"dispassionate assessments,\" \nfree from any personal bias. \nIn Williams v. Pennsylvania (2016), the court held that a state judge's potential bias violated due \nprocess because he had played a role, a quarter-century earlier, in prosecuting the death-row inmate \nwhose habeas corpus petition he was hearing. The passage of time and involvement of others do not \nvitiate the taint but heighten \"the need for objective rules preventing the operation of bias that might \notherwise be obscured,\" the justices wrote. A single biased individual \"might still have an influence \nthat, while not so visible . . . is nevertheless significant.\" \nIn addition to the numerous anti-Trump messages uncovered by the inspector general, there is a strong \ncircumstantial case—including personnel, timing, methods and the absence of evidence—that Crossfire \nwas initiated for political, not national-security, purposes. \nIt was initiated in defiance of a longstanding Justice Department presumption against investigating \ncampaigns in an election year. And while impartiality is always required, a 2012 memo by then-\nAttorney General Eric Holder emphasizes that impartiality is \"particularly important in an election \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 026275 \nyear,\" and \"politics must play no role in the decisions of federal prosecutors or investigators regarding \nany investigations. . . . Law enforcement officers and prosecutors may never select the timing of \ninvestigative steps or criminal charges for the purpose of affecting any election, or for the purpose of \ngiving an advantage or disadvantage to any candidate or political party.\" \nStrong evidence of a crime can overcome this policy, as was the case with the bureau's investigation of \nMrs. Clinton's private email server, which began more than a year before the 2016 election. But \nCrossfire was not a criminal investigation. It was a counterintelligence investigation predicated on the \nnotion that Russia could be colluding with the Trump campaign. There appears to have been no \ndiscernible evidence of Trump-Russia collusion at the time Crossfire was launched, further reinforcing \nthe notion that it was initiated \"for the purpose\" of affecting the presidential election. \nThe chief evidence of collusion is the hacking of the Democratic National Committee's servers. But \nnothing in the public record suggests the Trump campaign aided that effort. The collusion narrative \ntherefore hinges on the more generic assertion that Russia aimed to help Mr. Trump's election, and that \nthe Trump campaign reciprocated by embracing pro-Russian policies. Yet despite massive surveillance \nand investigation, there's still no public evidence of any such exchange—only that Russia attempted to \nsow political discord by undermining Mrs. Clinton and to a lesser extent Mr. Trump. \nSome members of the Trump team interacted with Russians and advocated dovish policies. But so did \nnumerous American political and academic elites, including many Clinton advisers. Presidential \ncampaigns routinely seek opposition research and interact with foreign powers. The Clinton campaign \nfunded the Steele dossier, whose British author paid Russians to dish anti-Trump dirt. The Podesta \nGroup, led by the brother of Mrs. Clinton's campaign chairman, received millions lobbying for \nRussia's largest baffl( and the European Center for a Modern Ukraine, both with deep Kremlin ties. The \nClinton Foundation and Bill Clinton took millions from Kremlin-connected businesses. \nNo evidence has emerged of Trump-Russia collusion, and Mr. Mueller has yet to bring collusion-\nrelated charges against anyone. Evidence suggests one of his targets, George Papadopoulos, was lured \nto London, plied with the prospect of Russian information damaging to Mrs. Clinton, and taken to \ndinner, where he drunkenly bragged that he'd heard about such dirt but never seen it. These \ncircumstances not only fail to suggest Mr. Papadopoulos committed a crime, they reek of entrapment. \nThe source of this information, former Australian diplomat Alexander Downer, admits Mr. \nPapadopolous never mentioned emails, destroying any reasonable inference of a connection between \nthe DNC hack and the Trump campaign. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 026276 \nCrossfire's progenitors thus ignored an obvious question: If Russia promised unspecified dirt on Mrs. \nClinton but never delivered it, how would that amount to collusion with the Trump campaign? If \nanything, such behavior suggests an attempt to entice and potentially embarrass Mr. Trump by \ndangling the prospect of compromising information and getting his aides to jump at it. \nGiven the paucity of evidence, it's staggering that the FBI would initiate a counterintelligence \ninvestigation, led by politically biased staff, amid a presidential campaign. The aggressive methods and \nsubsequent leaking only strengthen that conclusion. If the FBI sincerely believed Trump associates \nwere Russian targets or agents, the proper response would have been to inform Mr. Trump so that he \ncould protect his campaign and the country. \nMr. Trump's critics argue that the claim of political bias is belied by the fact that Crossfire was not \nleaked before the election. In fact, there were vigorous, successful pre-election efforts to publicize the \nTrump-Russia collusion narrative. Shortly after Crossfire's launch, CIA Director John Brennan and Mr. \nComey briefed Congress, triggering predictable leaking. Christopher Steele and his patrons embarked \non a media roadshow, making their dossier something of an open secret in Washington. \nOn Aug. 29, 2016, the New York Times published a letter to Mr. Comey from Senate Minority Leader \nHarry Reid, saying he'd learned of \"evidence of a direct connection between the Russian government \nand Donald Trump's presidential campaign,\" which had \"employed a number of individuals with \nsignificant and disturbing ties to Russia and the Kremlin.\" On Aug. 30, the ranking Democratic \nmembers of four House committees wrote a public letter to Mr. Comey requesting \"that the FBI assess \nwhether connections between Trump campaign officials and Russian interests\" may have contributed \nto the DNC hack so as \"to interfere with the U.S. presidential election.\" On Sept. 23, Yahoo News's \nMichael Isikoff reported the Hill briefings and the Steele dossier's allegations regarding Carter Page. \nOn Oct. 30, Harry Reid again publicly wrote Mr. Comey: \"In my communications with you and other \ntop officials in the national security community, it has become clear that you possess explosive \ninformation about close ties and coordination between Donald Trump, his top advisors, and the Russian \ngovernment.\" \nThat these leaking efforts failed to prevent Mr. Trump's victory, or that Mr. Comey's ham-fisted \ninterventions might have also hurt Mrs. Clinton's electoral prospects, does not diminish the legal \nsignificance of the anti-Trump bias shown by government officials. \nThe totality of the circumstances creates the appearance that Crossfire was politically motivated. Since \nan attempt by federal law enforcement to influence a presidential election \"shocks the conscience,\" any \nprosecutorial effort derived from such an outrageous abuse of power must be suppressed. The public \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 026277 \nwill learn more once the inspector general finishes his investigation into Crossfire's genesis. But given \nwhat is now known, due process demands, at a minimum, that the special counsel's activity be paused. \nThose affected by Mr. Mueller's investigation could litigate such an argument in court. One would \nhope, however, that given the facts either Mr. Mueller himself or Deputy Attorney General Rod \nRosenstein would do it first. \nMr. Rivkin and Ms. Foley practice appellate and constitutional law in Washington.

But as you may know, it is a topic of considerable public debate, and \nseveral governments have been investigating the owners of such accounts. \nThere are a number of ways such accounts and also offshore trusts have been used to avoid inheritance tax, \nUK domestic tax, or tax imposed by other countries. Such accounts have also been used to launder money. \nWe have seen records held in the US identifying you among those who have held accounts. These accounts \ncontained assets of up to USD 3.5m, and include: \nHSBC (Suisse) SA \nFAMILY INTEREST L.P. \n22079 \nBESSIE \nJEFFREY EPSTEIN \n1) You may therefore have been a person evading or avoiding tax, or laundering money. \nWe will be particularly concerned with these questions: \n2) Why you had Swiss accounts. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 030378 \n3) How much back tax you have settled with the tax authorities following their investigation of your affairs. \nAdditionally, from public records and from material we have seen we note that: \n4) In 2008 you pleaded guilty to solicitation of prostitution and procuring minors for prostitution. You were \nsentenced to 18 months in prison. \n5) Your above accounts were also linked with Mr Leslie Wexner. \n6) You are known to be or have previously been closely associated with Bill Clinton, Prince Andrew and Kevin \nSpacey. \n7) You have made substantial contributions to the Clintons' philanthropic causes. Tax reform campaigners \nhave previously been critical of those who engage in public life or the political process while avoiding or \nevading tax.

It is \npossible for a person to be kind and generous with his friends but still a criminal paying for sex with \nunderage girls in his private life. \nI'm going to write about the topic on Skepchick, and I'll include any additional statement you'd like if you \nwant to provide more context or if you've changed your mind. \n-R \nOn Wed, Apr 6, 2011 at 12:50 PM, Lawrence Krauss wrote: \nyes it is..

As a scientist I \nalways judge things on empirical evidence and he always has women ages 19 to 23 around him, but I've \nnever seen anything else, so as a scientist, my presumption is that whatever the problems were I would \nbelieve him over other people.\" Though colleagues have criticized him over his relationship with Epstein, \nKrauss insists, \"I don't feel tarnished in any way by my relationship with Jeffrey; I feel raised by it.\" \nThanks, \nRebecca Watson \nLawrence M.

Then,\nabruptly. the investigation was dropped and Jeffrey Epstein pleaded guilty to a single state\ncharge of soliciting prostitution. He served just over a year in jail.\n\nNow, two women who say they were among his victims have won a precedent-setting appeals\ncourt ruling entitling them to see all the documents from the plea bargain discussions between\nEpstein's high-powered lawyers and federal prosecutors.\n\nTheir goal: use those files to undo the agreement, reopen the investigation and subject Epstein to\nmore charges.\n\nThe women's lawyers contend Epstein got special treatment because of his wealth and\nconnections. His attorneys deny that.\n\nEpstein, 61. made hundreds of millions of dollars managing funds for rich clients, Shortly after\nhis 2008 guilty plea. it came to light that his lawyers had secretly reached a non-prosecution\nagreement months earlier with the U.S. Justice Department that spared him a potentially heavier\npunishment.\n\n“Our complaint alleges that. prodded by Epstein. the federal prosecutors deliberately concealed\nthe sweetheart plea deal they made with him to avoid public criticism.” said Paul Cassell. a\nUniversity of Utah law professor who is representing the two women.\n\nThe U.S. attorney's office in Miami would not comment. But the U.S. attorney at the time. R.\nAlexander Acosta, said in a 2011 letter defending his office that more evidence came to light\nafter Epstein made his deal.\n\n\"Many victims have spoken out. filing detailed statements in civil cases seeking damages.\nPhysical evidence has been discovered,\" Acosta wrote. \"Had these additional statements and\nevidence been known, the outcome may have been different.”\n\nEpstein has settled lawsuits for undisclosed amounts with many of the women who say they were\nunderage when they were paid for sex.\n\nThe case represents the first time a federal appeals court has ruled that the Crime Victims’ Rights\nAct of 2004 guarantees victims the right to be informed about the details of how a plea bargain\n\nwas reached, according to legal experts and lawyers involved in the case. The law marked the\nculmination of efforts begun in the 1960s to give crime victims more of a say,\n\n25\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_011936\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

Meanwhile,\n46 U.S. states have enacted at least one law that permits the manufacturing, distribution, dispensing or\npossession of cannabis or concentrates. These laws fall into three general categories:\n\n¢ 29 U.S. states (and the District of Columbia) have enacted medical cannabis laws that permit\nthe production and possession of cannabis or concentrates for use in treating a broad range of\nqualifying medical conditions,\n\n¢ 19 U.S. states have enacted narrow CBD/limited laws that permit possession of small amounts\nof low-THC/high-CBD cannabis concentrates for use in treating a few serious medical condi-\ntions—in particular, severe forms of childhood epilepsy.\n\n* 8 USS. states have enacted recreational laws that permit the commercial production and sale of\ncannabis to adults for recreational and other uses.\n\nThe following map of the United States shows states with medical cannabis laws, CBD/limited laws\nor recreational laws (a state with more than one of these laws is represented on the map by its most\npermissive law).\n\nU.S. State Cannabis Laws (January 2018)\n\nGE Recreational Law\nME Medical Cannabis Law\n[PN] CBDiLimited Law\n\n© 2017 Ackrell Capital, LLC | Member FINRA/SIPC 3\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_024639\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

See In re Terrorist Attacks on September 11, 2001, 349 F.Supp.2d 765 (S.D.N.Y.2005) (“Terrorist Attacks I” ). Generally, Plaintiffs are representatives, survivors, and insurance carriers of the victims of the attacks of September 11, 2001, who allege, pursuant to various theories of liability including the Antiterrorism Act (“ATA”), 18 U.S.C. § 2331 et seq.; the Alien Tort Claims Act (“ATCA”), 28 U.S.C. § 1350; the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (“RICO”), 18 U.S.C. § 1961 et seq.; the Torture Victim Protection Act (“TVPA”), 28 U.S.C. § 1350 note; theories of aiding and abetting, civil conspiracy, intentional infliction of emotional distress, negligence, survival, wrongful death, trespass, and assault and battery, that Defendants are responsible for those attacks as terrorists, state sponsors of terror, or material sponsors of terror. In Terrorist Attacks I, the Court resolved several motions to dismiss the complaints by various Defendants. Additional motions remain pending before the Court.\n \nSaudi High Commission (“SHC”), HRH Prince Salman bin Abdulaziz Al–Saud (“Prince Salman”), and HRH Prince Naif bin Abdulaziz Al–Saud (“Prince Naif”) move to dismiss the complaints for lack of subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to the FSIA, lack of personal jurisdiction, and failure to state a claim for relief. Immediately prior to the Court’s scheduled oral argument on these motions, the Federal Plaintiffs moved to supplement the record against Prince Salman and Prince Naif.\n \nDefendants Rabita Trust, Wa‘el Jalaidan, and International Islamic Relief Organization (“IIRO”) move to dismiss the *547 complaints for lack of personal jurisdiction and failure to state a claim.\n \nOther Defendants move to dismiss the complaints for failure to state a claim. Tarik Hamdi and Abdulrahman Alamoudi move to dismiss the Burnett and Federal complaints. Success Foundation moves to dismiss the Burnett complaint. The Burnett Plaintiffs denominate certain Defendants as the “SAAR Network entities.” The SAAR Network entities, which include African Muslim Agency, Grove Corporate, Heritage Education Trust, International Institute of Islamic Thought (“IIIT”), Mar–Jac Investments, Mar–Jac Poultry, Reston Investments, Safa Trust, and York Foundation, move to dismiss the Burnett complaint. IIIT also moves to dismiss the Ashton complaint. In addition to its motion to dismiss Burnett, Mar–Jac Poultry moves to dismiss the Ashton and Federal complaints. The Federal Plaintiffs label certain individuals “SAAR Network executives.” These Defendants, including Taha Al–Awani, Muhammad Ashraf, M. Omar Ashraf, M. Yaqub Mirza, Iqbal Unus, and Jamal Barzinji, move to dismiss the Federal complaint.\n \nFinally, Defendant National Commercial Bank (“NCB”) moves for reconsideration of this Court’s denial without prejudice of its motions to dismiss the Ashton and Burnett complaints. The Court resolves all the aforementioned motions in this opinion.\n \n\n\nI. Subject Matter Jurisdiction Under the FSIA\n[1] [2] Pursuant to the FSIA, a foreign state and its instrumentalities are presumed immune from this Court’s jurisdiction unless one of the statute’s exceptions applies. Robinson v. Gov’t of Malaysia, 269 F.3d 133, 138 (2d Cir.2001). “In contrast to a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim, in a challenge to FSIA subject matter jurisdiction, the defendant must present a ‘prima facie case that it is a foreign sovereign.’ ” Virtual Countries v. Republic of South Africa, 300 F.3d 230, 241 (2d Cir.2002) (quoting Cargill Int’l S.A. v. M/T PAVEL DYBENKO, 991 F.2d 1012, 1016 (2d Cir.1993)). “Then, the plaintiff ‘has the burden of going forward with evidence showing that, under the exceptions to the FSIA, immunity should not be granted.’ ” Virtual Countries, 300 F.3d at 241 (quoting Cargill, 991 F.2d at 1016); see also Terrorist Attacks I, 349 F.Supp.2d at 792–797 (explaining that the possibly relevant exceptions to immunity in this litigation include the commercial activities, torts, and state sponsor of terrorism exceptions). Determining whether this burden is met involves a ‘review [of] the allegations in the complaint, the undisputed facts, if any, placed before [the court] by the parties, and—if the plaintiff comes forward with sufficient evidence to carry its burden of production on this issue—[resolution of] disputed issues of fact.’ ” Virtual Countries, 300 F.3d at 241 (quoting Robinson, 269 F.3d at 141). Throughout the inquiry, Defendants retain the burden of persuasion, which they must meet by a preponderance of the evidence. Virtual Countries, 300 F.3d at 241; see also Robinson, 269 F.3d at 141 n. 8.\n \n\n\n A. Allegations Against Defendants Asserting Foreign Sovereign Immunity\n\n 1. Saudi High Commission1\nIn 1993, then-King Fahad bin Abdulaziz Al–Saud, the President of the Council of *548 Ministers of Saudi Arabia, decreed the formation of SHC, also known as the Saudi High Relief Commission, by High Order 17419. (Ashton Compl. ¶ 446; Burnett Compl. ¶ 392; Federal Compl. ¶ 180; see also SHC Mem. in Sup. Mot. to Dismiss at 3.) The same High Order named Defendant Prince Salman the President of SHC. (Ashton Compl. ¶ 446; Burnett Compl. ¶ 392; SHC Mem. in Sup. Mot. to Dismiss at 3.)\n \nSHC allegedly has contributed $600 million to aid “Bosnian Muslims impoverished by the country’s recent civil war.” (Ashton Compl. ¶ 446; Burnett Compl. ¶ 392.) Plaintiffs claim, however, that SHC does not provide support to the needy but actually diverts funds for terrorist activities. (Ashton Compl. ¶ 454; Burnett Compl. ¶ 404.) In support, Plaintiffs allege that Prince Salman received a letter in September 2000 from a Bosnian association claiming SHC did not provide charitable assistance, and that none of the money collected after the fall of Srebrenica in July 1995 actually reached the Srebrenican people. (Ashton Compl. ¶¶ 454–55; Burnett Com pl. ¶¶ 404–05; Federal Compl. ¶¶ 185, 457.) Plaintiffs claim SHC’s financial records fail to account for $41 million. (Ashton Compl. ¶ 456; Burnett Compl. ¶ 407; Federal Compl. ¶ 460.) SHC allegedly made donations to charity Defendant Taibah and the bin Laden Establishment. (Ashton Compl. ¶¶ 376, 462 (relying on 1995 bin Laden interview); Burnett Compl. ¶ 298.) Plaintiffs also claim that SHC is responsible for “importing the extreme form of Saudi Islam, Wahhabism” to Bosnia. (Ashton Compl. ¶ 447; Burnett Compl. ¶ 393.)\n \nThe Federal Plaintiffs allege that al Qaeda fighters began entering Bosnia–Herzegovina in 1992 disguised as SHC relief workers. (Federal Compl. ¶ 183.) On October 21, 2001, a group of Algerians who were supposedly part of the al Qaeda network were arrested in Bosnia Herzegovina on charges of terrorism directed at the United States embassy. (Ashton Compl. ¶¶ 448–49; Burnett Compl. ¶¶ 394–95.) One of the arrested, Sabir Lamar, apparently worked for SHC as an Arabic language teacher. (Ashton Compl. ¶ 450; Burnett Compl. ¶ 396.) Also in October 2001, Plaintiffs claim that United States forces raided the Sarajevo branch of SHC and “found computer hard drives with photographs of the World Trade Center before and after its collapse as well as photos of United States embassies in Kenya and Tanzania and the U.S.S. Cole.” (Ashton Compl. ¶ 451; Burnett Compl. ¶ 397; Federal Compl. ¶ ¶ 186, 458.) The U.S. forces also apparently found files on pesticides and crop dusters, the locations of Washington government buildings, fake State Department badges, and cash. (Ashton Compl. ¶¶ 451, 453; Burnett Compl. ¶¶ 397, 399; Federal Compl. ¶¶ 186, 459.) After the raid, the Financial Police of the Federation of Bosnia Herzegovina Ministry of Finance analyzed the seized documents and stated that some did “not belong in the scope of work of a humanitarian organization.” (Federal Compl. ¶¶ 187, 459; see also Ashton Compl. ¶ 452; Burnett Compl. ¶ 398.) The Federal Plaintiffs claim that the SHC “has long acted as a fully integrated component of al Qaida’s logistical and financial support infrastructure ... [and that the attacks of September 11 were] a direct, intended and foreseeable product of [its] participation in al Qaida’s jihadist campaign.” (Federal Compl. ¶¶ 182, 189.)\n \n\n\n *549 2. Prince Salman2\nPrince Salman is a member of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia’s Council of Ministers, the governor of the province of Riyadh, and the President of Defendant SHC. (Prince Salman Mem. in Sup. Mot. to Dismiss at 2.) Plaintiffs allege that Prince Salman provided material support to Osama bin Laden and al Qaeda. (Ashton Compl. ¶ 255; Burnett Compl. ¶ 403; Federal Compl. ¶¶ 455, 463; see also Federal RICO Statement Applicable to Saudi Princes at Ex. A.) The Federal Plaintiffs claim Prince Salman “fully intended [SHC] would serve as a vehicle for funding and supporting Islamic militants in Bosnia, including elements of the al Qaida movement.” (Federal Compl. ¶ 456.) “Prince Salman knowingly failed to take appropriate actions regarding the management and use of funds of the SHC in Bosnia.” (Ashton Compl. ¶ 457; Burnett Compl. ¶ 406.) On December 30, 2000, the Embassy of the State of Palestine in Riyadh sent Prince Salman a letter expressing Yasser Arafat’s concern regarding the funding of radical organizations in Palestine. (Ashton Compl. ¶ 291; Burnett Compl. ¶ 402.) Further, Plaintiffs claim Prince Salman “has a history of funding Islamic extremism,” because he was named the Chairman of the General Donation Committee for Afghanistan in 1980, which gave $39 million to aid the Afghan mujahideen. (Ashton Compl. ¶ 289; Burnett Compl. ¶ 400.)\n \nIn 1994, Prince Salman allegedly stated that he had personally raised more than six million Saudi Riyals for Defendant IIRO and Sanabel al-Kheer. (Federal Compl. ¶ 462.) And in 1998, he allegedly donated one million Saudi Riyals during a fundraising drive by IIRO and Sanabel al-Kheer. (Federal Compl. ¶ 461.) In 1999, Prince Salman donated $400,000 during a fundraising event organized by charity Defendants IIRO, World Assembly of Muslim Youth (“WAMY”), and Al–Haramain Foundation for the benefit of Bosnia Herzegovina and Chechnya. (Ashton Compl. ¶ 290; Burnett Compl. ¶ 401; Federal Compl. ¶ 461.) Finally, Plaintiffs claim that members of the Saudi royal family have assets and do business in the United States. (Ashton Compl. ¶ 296.)\n \n\n\n 3. Prince Naif3\nPrince Naif has been the Minister of Interior of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia since 1975. (Ashton Compl. ¶ 286; Federal Compl. ¶ 433; Prince Naif Mem. in Supp. Mot. to Dismiss at 1, 5.) According to Plaintiffs, the Minister of Interior “controls the activities of Islamic Charities and is empowered to verify their legality and conduct.” (Ashton Compl. ¶ 286; Burnett Compl. ¶ 382; see also Federal Compl. ¶ 435 (alleging that as Minister of Interior Prince Naif is “responsible for the oversight of charities based within Saudi Arabia, including the operations of the Saudi Joint Relief Committee [ (‘SJRC’) ], Muslim World League [ (‘MWL’) ], IIRO, Saudi Red Crescent, WAMY, and al Haramain Foundation”).) He is also a member of the Council of Ministers and serves on the Supreme Council for Islamic Affairs. (Plaintiff’s Mem. in Opp’n to Prince Naif’s Mot. at 2–3, 5.)\n \nPlaintiffs claim that “Prince Naif has engaged in a pattern of conduct that aids, abets, and materially sponsors international terrorism and Al Qaeda.” (Ashton Compl. ¶¶ 288, 255; Burnett Compl. ¶¶ 342, 381; Federal Compl. ¶ 434; see also Federal RICO Statement Applicable to Saudi Princes at Ex. A.) They claim that along with other Saudi princes, Prince *550 Naif made “monetary payoffs to Osama bin Laden’s al Qaeda.” (Ashton Compl. ¶ 288; Burnett Compl. ¶ 381.) “In 1996, according to various intelligence sources, a group of Saudi princes ... met in Paris and agreed to continue contributing, sponsoring, aiding and abetting Osama bin Laden’s terrorist network.” (Burnett Compl. ¶ 347.) Plaintiffs claim that Prince Naif and the Saudi government received warnings from the United States and France that charitable donations to Islamic charities were being used to fund terrorism. (See Plaintiffs’ Mem. in Opp’n to Naif’s Mot. to Dismiss at 5.) Prince Naif was present for one such meeting in 1994 with French Interior Minister Charles Pasqua. (Id.) The Federal Plaintiffs allege that Prince Naif has used his position as the Minister of Interior to “protect al Qaida’s support infrastructure.” (Federal Compl. ¶ 438.)\n \nThe Federal complaint further alleges that “[b]etween 1998 and 2000, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, through SJRC, diverted more than $74 million to al Qaida members and loyalists affiliated with SJRC bureaus. Throughout this time, [SJRC] was under the supervision and control of ... Prince Naif.” (Federal Compl. ¶¶ 126, 436.) “Prince Naif also heads the Saudi Committee for Relief to Afghans, ... [i]n this position, Prince Naif has channeled substantial financial and logistical support to sustain al Qaida’s presence and operations in Afghanistan.” (Id. ¶ 437.) Plaintiffs allege that Prince Naif is the “Chairman of the Saudi Arabian Committee for Support of the Intifada al Quds, [which] knowingly transferred large sums of money to the families of Hamas terrorists who had executed murderous attacks against Israelis.” (Ashton Compl. ¶ 287; Burnett Compl. ¶ 379; Federal Compl. ¶ 439; see also Burnett Compl. ¶ 380 (citing letter written on behalf of Yasser Arafat and claiming this committee funds radical groups).) As a result, Plaintiffs assert that “Prince Naif ... supports suicide martyrs.” (Ashton Compl. ¶ 287; Burnett Compl. ¶ 379.) The Federal Plaintiffs also allege that in 2003, U.S. Senator Charles Schumer asked that Prince Naif be replaced as Interior Minister because of his “well-documented history of supporting terrorist financing and ignoring the evidence when it comes to investigating terrorist attacks on Americans.” (Federal Compl. ¶ 441.) Finally, the Federal Plaintiffs claim Prince Naif made significant personal contributions to Saudi-based charities that were sponsors of al Qaida’s operations, including IIRO, MWL, WAMY, BIF, SHC, SJRC, and al Haramain. (Federal Compl. ¶¶ 442–43.)\n \n[3] The Federal Plaintiffs seek leave to supplement the record against Prince Salman and Prince Naif with an article that appeared in Rus al Yusef, an Egyptian publication, in August 1998. The unidentified author writes that Islamic aid organizations located in Afghanistan, Bosnia, Somalia, and Tajikistan provided funds and cover to terrorists. (See Federal Mot. to Supplement Record on Prince Naif and Prince Salman, Ex. 2, at 2.) Donors to these unidentified organizations “probably ha[d] no idea where their charity money ha[d] gone.” (Id.) Prince Naif reportedly responded that “if charity money is going to illegitimate targets, it must stop immediately.” (Id.) From this submission, the Plaintiffs argue that the Princes knew their charitable donations were going to terrorists.\n \nThe submission is problematic for a variety of reasons and will not be accepted. First, Plaintiffs do not provide an explanation as why they were only able to obtain and translate the article on the eve of oral argument—well after the motions were fully submitted. Second, the article and *551 its translation have not been authenticated. More pointedly, however, it simply does not say that the Princes were put on notice regarding specific charities and that they continued to contribute to those charities with the intent that their donations would assist al Qaeda. The Federal Plaintiffs’ motion to supplement the record against Prince Salman and Prince Naif is denied.\n \n\n\n B. Defendants’ Status as Foreign States for FSIA Purposes\n[4] The FSIA provides the following definition of “foreign state”:\n (a) A “foreign state” ... includes a political subdivision of a foreign state or an agency or instrumentality of a foreign state as defined in subsection (b).\n (b) An “agency or instrumentality of a foreign state” means any entity—\n  (1) which is a separate legal person, corporate or otherwise, and\n  (2) which is an organ of a foreign state or political subdivision thereof, or a majority of whose shares or other ownership interest is owned by a foreign state or political subdivision thereof, and\n  (3) which is neither a citizen of a State of the United States ... nor created under the laws of any third country.\n28 U.S.C. § 1603. Further, “immunity under the FSIA extends also to agents of a foreign state acting in their official capacities [because] [i]t is generally recognized that a suit against an individual acting in his official capacity is the practical equivalent of a suit against the sovereign directly.” Bryks v. Canadian Broad. Corp., 906 F.Supp. 204, 210 (S.D.N.Y.1995) (internal quotations omitted); see also Terrorist Attacks I, 349 F.Supp.2d at 788–89 (finding Princes Sultan and Turki were foreign states for FSIA purposes to the extent Plaintiffs alleged liability for actions taken in their official capacities).\n \n\n\n 1. SHC\n[5] SHC contends that it is an organ, agency, or instrumentality of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and acts on behalf of the Kingdom to fund a range of humanitarian relief efforts to Bosnia, Egypt, and Somalia. (See generally Al–Roshood Decl., at Huffman Decl. Ex. A.) In support of its position as a foreign state, SHC submits the affidavits of Dr. Al–Nafissa, a Saudi Arabian lawyer and a Minister of State on the Council of Ministers in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, and Mr. Al–Roshood, who has been the Director of the Executive Office of SHC since its inception. The Court notes it is “required to give ‘great weight’ to any extrinsic submissions made by the foreign defendants regarding the scope of their official responsibilities.” Leutwyler v. Office of Her Majesty Queen Rania Al–Abdullah, 184 F.Supp.2d 277, 287 (S.D.N.Y.2001).\n \nKing Faud authorized Dr. Al–Nafissa to make his declaration concerning SHC. (Al–Nafissa Decl. ¶ 2, at Huffman Decl. Ex. C.) Dr. Al–Nafissa attests that SHC is “an arm of the Saudi Arabian government [and that its actions] are in keeping with the foreign and domestic governmental policies of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.” (Id. ¶ 3.) SHC was formed by Decision of the President of the Council of Ministers in 1993. (Al–Roshood Decl. ¶ 6.) In the same Decision, the Council of Ministers appointed Prince Salman as President of SHC. (Id. ¶ 7.) As President of SHC, Prince Salman is the head of SHC’s Executive Committee and Supreme Commission, members of which Prince Salman appoints. (Id.) SHC is staffed by civil servant employees of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. (Id. ¶ 10.)\n \nDr. Al–Nafissa states that private charities in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia receive governmental approval through Royal Order, are run by boards, and disburse *552 funds in accordance with their charters. (Al–Nafissa Decl. ¶ 5.) In contrast, governmental commissions, such as SHC, are chaired by a governmental official, like Prince Salman, and conduct their affairs in accordance with the Kingdom’s policy objectives. (Id. ¶ 5.) According to Dr. Al–Nafissa, “[d]ecisions regarding causes to support and recipients for Saudi High Commission funds are within the discretion of the Executive Committee, the Supreme Commission, and Prince Salman.” (Id. ¶ 8.) The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is SHC’s largest source of funding, having provided approximately 30% of the funds used and distributed by SHC. (Al–Roshood Decl. ¶ 24.) The remainder of SHC funds are collected through fundraisers “in accordance with the directives of ... King Fahd.” (Id. ¶ 5.) SHC can be sued for its administrative acts in the Board of Grievances. (Al–Nafissa Decl. ¶ 8.)\n \nIn their complaint, the Federal Plaintiffs alleged that SHC is “an agency, instrumentality and organ of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.” (Federal Compl. ¶ 181.) They now back away from that allegation and join other Plaintiffs in disputing SHC’s status. Plaintiffs submit that SHC has repeatedly and systematically described itself as a non-governmental organization in representations to the Bosnian government. (See Plaintiffs’ Mem. in Opp’n to SHC Mot. to Dismiss at 10.) Thus, even if SHC is considered a foreign state, Plaintiffs assert it has implicitly waived its immunity through those representations. See 28 U.S.C. § 1605(a)(1) (FSIA waiver provision). Plaintiffs also argue that it is disingenuous for SHC to simultaneously maintain that it is an organ of the Kingdom and that this Court lacks personal jurisdiction over it when the Kingdom itself did not dispute the personal jurisdiction issue.\n \nIn response to Plaintiffs’ arguments that it described itself as a non-governmental organization to Bosnian authorities, SHC submits the declaration of Hadsimuratovic Hajrudin, a Bosnian lawyer who serves as a legal advisor to SHC. (See generally Hajrudin Decl. at SHC Reply Ex. A.) Mr. Hajrudin states that SHC characterized itself as non-governmental in accordance with Article 22 of the Law on Humanitarian Activities and Humanitarian Organizations of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina because SHC is “not considered part of the government of Bosnia–Herzegovina.” (Id. ¶ 4.) Mr. Hajrudin attests that the head of SHC’s European Office received diplomatic status in Bosnia–Herzegovina in 1996 because SHC is an organization of the Saudi government. (Id. ¶ 6.) He also states that the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is represented by SHC when it makes donations to Bosnia–Herzegovina. (Id.)\n \n[6] There is no dispute that SHC is a separate legal person from the Kingdom and not a citizen of the United States or any third country. See 28 U.S.C. § 1603. Accordingly, the only dispute regarding SHC’s status is whether it is an organ of the Kingdom. In Filler v. Hanvit Bank, 378 F.3d 213 (2d Cir.2004), the Second Circuit considered various factors to determine whether an entity could be considered an organ of a foreign sovereign. Id. at 217. The factors include:\n      (1) whether the foreign state created the entity for a national purpose; (2) whether the foreign state actively supervises the entity; (3) whether the foreign state requires the hiring of public employees and pays their salaries; (4) whether the entity holds exclusive rights to some right in the [foreign] country; and (5) how the entity is treated under foreign state law.\nId. at 217 (citations omitted).\n \nSHC offers undisputed evidence that it was created by the Kingdom’s Council of *553 Ministers to “centralize all charitable giving from the Kingdom to Bosnia–Herzegovina [and that it was] vested with the sole authority to collect and distribute charitable funds in Bosnia.” (Al–Roshood Decl. ¶¶ 5–6; Hajrudin Decl. ¶ 6 & Ex. D (noting the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia provides humanitarian relief to Bosnia through SHC).) The Council of Ministers appointed Prince Salman to supervise SHC. (Al Roshood Decl. ¶¶ 7–9.) The salaries of SHC employees are paid by either the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia or out of the SHC budget. (Id. ¶ 10.) Like other Saudi Arabian government agencies, SHC can be sued in the administrative court of the Kingdom. (Al–Nafissa Decl. ¶ 8.)\n \nThe Court finds that SHC has made a prima facie showing that it is a foreign sovereign. See Cargill, 991 F.2d at 1016 (requiring defendant to make prima facie case of sovereignty). Because SHC was formed by order of the Kingdom’s governing body, it provides the Kingdom’s aid to Bosnia, it is governed by a Saudi official and its employees are civil servants, it is an organ of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. See Filler, 378 F.3d at 217. Further, the Court finds SHC has not waived its sovereign immunity. The representations to the contrary on which Plaintiffs rely were made before this lawsuit was contemplated and cannot be read as a waiver of immunity from this court’s jurisdiction. The Second Circuit has made clear that the waiver of FSIA immunity must be explicit. See Banco de Seguros del Estado v. Mutual Marine Office, Inc., 344 F.3d 255, 261 (2d Cir.2003) (requiring wavier that unambiguously waives claims of immunity from legal proceedings in this country). Finally, Plaintiffs have not identified a factual dispute that would require jurisdictional discovery. See Filetech S.A. v. France Telecom S.A., 304 F.3d 180, 183 (2d Cir.2002) (finding no abuse of discretion where district court resolved jurisdictional issue without holding evidentiary hearing because factual disputes were “readily ascertainable” from the record). Accordingly, Plaintiffs must demonstrate that an exception under the FSIA applies to their claims against SHC. See Virtual Countries, 300 F.3d at 241.\n \n\n\n 2. Prince Salman and Prince Naif\n[7] Aside from allegations regarding personal contributions to charities that were fronts for terrorists, the Plaintiffs’ claims against Prince Salman and Prince Naif concern their official functions. The allegations against Prince Salman, for example, center on his role as President of SHC, (see, e.g., Ashton Compl. ¶ 457; Burnett Compl. ¶ 406; Federal Compl. ¶ 456) or as Governor of Riyadh, (see Ashton Compl. ¶ 291; Burnett Compl. ¶ 402). Similarly, the allegations against Prince Naif center on his role as Minister of Interior of the Kingdom. (See Ashton Compl. ¶ 286; Burnett Compl. ¶ 382; Federal Compl. ¶ 435.) To the extent the allegations concern actions undertaken in their government positions, the Court finds that Prince Salman and Prince Naif are foreign states for FSIA purposes. See Leutwyler, 184 F.Supp.2d at 286–87 (recognizing that “individuals employed by a foreign state’s agencies or instrumentalities are deemed ‘foreign states’ when they are sued for actions undertaken within the scope of their official capacities”). Thus, Plaintiffs must also show that an FSIA exception applies to Princes Salman and Naif. Virtual Countries, 300 F.3d at 241.\n \n\n\n C. Application of FSIA Torts Exception\nPlaintiffs claim any immunity enjoyed by SHC, Prince Salman, and Prince Naif is overcome by the FSIA’s torts exception. The Federal Plaintiffs also argue that the commercial activities exception should lift *554 the sovereigns’ immunity. For the reasons explained in its previous opinion, the Court concludes that the torts exception is the only exception relevant to the allegations contained in the Ashton, Burnett, and Federal complaints against SHC, Prince Salman, and Prince Naif. See Terrorist Attacks I, 349 F.Supp.2d at 793–94 (explaining that the Federal Plaintiffs’ reliance on the commercial activities exception is inappropriate because the alleged acts by Defendants were not the type of actions “by which a private party engages in trade and traffic or commerce,” and explaining the state sponsor of terrorism exception applies only to designated state sponsors of terror, of which the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is not).\n \n[8] [9] The torts exception lifts immunity for “personal injury or death, or damage to or loss of property, occurring in the United States and caused by the tortious act or omission of that foreign state or any official ... of that foreign state while acting in the scope of his office.” 28 U.S.C. § 1605(a)(5). For jurisdiction to be proper under the torts exception, Plaintiffs will have to show, first, that the Defendants’ tortious acts caused Plaintiffs’ injuries. Robinson v. Gov’t of Malaysia, 269 F.3d 133, 142 (2d Cir.2001) (“If those activities could not render the Malaysian government liable for a tort under New York law, then it remained immune under § 1605(a)(5).”). Second, Plaintiffs must show that Defendants’ actions were not discretionary, i.e., not grounded in the social, economic, or political policies of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Terrorist Attacks I, 349 F.Supp.2d at 794–97; see also 28 U.S.C. § 1605(a)(5)(A) (providing that the torts exception is not applicable to “any claim based upon the exercise or performance or the failure to exercise or perform a discretionary function regardless of whether the discretion be abused”). “Under the FSIA’s ‘discretionary function’ exception, ‘acts which are performed at the planning level of government, as opposed to those at the operational level, are protected by the immunity.’ ” Marchisella v. Gov’t of Japan, No. 02 Civ. 10023(DC), 2004 WL 307248, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. Feb.17, 2004) (quoting Napolitano v. Tishman Constr. Corp., No. 96 Civ. 4402(SJ), 1998 WL 102789, at *4 (E.D.N.Y. Feb.26, 1998)).\n \nHere, since SHC, Prince Salman, and Prince Naif are not alleged to have been the actual perpetrators of the attacks, Plaintiffs rely on theories of conspiracy and aiding and abetting.\n      Conspiracy and aiding and abetting are varieties of concerted-action liability: conspiracy requires an agreement to commit a tortious act ..., aiding and abetting requires that the defendant have given substantial assistance or encouragement to the primary wrongdoer.... In order to be liable for acting in concert with the primary tortfeasor under either theory, the defendant must know the wrongful nature of the primary actor’s conduct.\nPittman v. Grayson, 149 F.3d 111, 122–23 (2d Cir.1998). Accordingly, to survive these Rule 12(b)(1) motions to dismiss, Plaintiffs must plead facts from which it reasonably can be inferred that the Defendants knew or should have known that their tortious actions were supporting terrorists or terrorist fronts. Terrorist Attacks I, 349 F.Supp.2d at 800–01; see also Boim v. Quranic Literacy Inst., 291 F.3d 1000, 1023 (7th Cir.2002) (“Boim II” ) (explaining elements of concerted-action civil liability under ATA); Virtual Countries, 300 F.3d at 241 (“Determining whether [Plaintiffs have demonstrated that one of the FSIA’s exceptions applies] involves a review of the allegations in the complaint, the undisputed facts, if any, placed before *555 the court by the parties, and—if the plaintiff comes forward with sufficient evidence to carry its burden of production on this issue—resolution of disputed issues of fact.”) (internal quotations omitted).\n \n\n\n 1. SHC\n[10] Even if Plaintiffs alleged that SHC was tortiously liable for the attacks of September 11, such allegations could not overcome the discretionary function exception. SHC offers undisputed evidence that all decisions regarding the distribution of humanitarian relief funds were within the sole discretion of its Chairman Prince Salman and the advisors he selected. (See Al–Nafissa Decl. ¶ 8.) Further, SHC was guided by the Kingdom’s policies regarding Bosnia–Herzegovina in making its funding determinations. (Id. ¶ 3.) Accordingly, SHC’s alleged misuse of funds and/or inadequate record-keeping—even if it resulted in the funds going to terrorists—was the result of a discretionary function and cannot be the basis for overcoming SHC’s immunity. See U.S. v. S.A. Empresa de Viacao Aerea Rio Grandense (Varig Airlines), 467 U.S. 797, 814, 104 S.Ct. 2755, 81 L.Ed.2d 660 (1984) (explaining FTCA discretionary function exception is designed to “prevent judicial ‘second-guessing’ of ... decisions grounded in social, economic, and political policy through the medium of an action in tort”); Marchisella, 2004 WL 307248, at *2 (explaining the FSIA’s discretionary function exception replicates that found in the FTCA and that courts rely on the FTCA for guidance in interpreting the scope of the FSIA’s exception); Kline v. Kaneko, 685 F.Supp. 386, 392 (S.D.N.Y.1988) (explaining sovereign’s decisions regarding formation and enforcement of national policies are discretionary functions); 28 U.S.C. § 1605(a)(5)(A) (stating torts exception is not applicable to claims based discretionary actions, even when that discretion is abused). Accordingly, the Court finds SHC is immune from suit in this litigation. Its motions to dismiss the Ashton, Burnett, and Federal complaints for lack subject matter jurisdiction are granted.\n \n\n\n 2. Prince Salman and Prince Naif\n[11] Similarly, even if Plaintiffs adequately plead a tort against Prince Salman and Prince Naif, the discretionary function exception prevents this Court from exercising jurisdiction over them in their official capacities. Plaintiffs take issue with Prince Salman’s management of SHC and its funding decisions. Prince Salman’s direction of SHC, however, is discretionary. He was appointed President of SHC by King Fahd to carry out the Kingdom’s policy toward the refugees of the Bosnian war. (Al–Roshood Decl. ¶ 6; Al–Nafissa Decl. ¶ 5.) Plaintiffs claim that as Chairman of the General Donation Committee for Afghanistan he assisted the Afghanistan mujahideen in the 1980s. To the extent Prince Salman held this position as a member of the Saudi government, this was also a policy decision made at the operational level of government. Plaintiffs claim Yasser Arafat complained to Prince Salman as Governor of Riyadh regarding Saudi funding of extremists in Palestine. Plaintiffs do not allege, however, what relation that complaint has to the al Qaeda terrorists or this litigation. They argue that Prince Salman, who did not attend the meeting with the former French Minister of Interior, should have known from Saudi officials who did meet with him that unnamed terrorists were receiving funding from largely unidentified Saudi charities.4 See *556 Terrorist Attacks I, 349 F.Supp.2d at 799. The Saudi attendees’ decisions concerning with whom the French Minister’s warnings should be shared and what the Saudi response would be, are surely grounded in social, economic, and political policy, and are, therefore, not actionable under the FSIA. Varig Airlines, 467 U.S. at 814, 104 S.Ct. 2755.\n \nSimilarly, the claims against Prince Naif stem from his discretionary functions. The Plaintiffs complain that Prince Naif, as Minister of Interior, ignored warnings in 1994 from French Interior Minister Charles Pasqua that Islamic charities were being used to fund terrorism. Additionally, Plaintiffs contend that he did not adequately supervise certain Saudi charities whose diverted funds allegedly landed in the coffers of al Qaeda and Hamas.\n \nPrince Naif’s role on the Council of Ministers and as Minister of Interior makes it “nearly self-evident” that his official acts are “squarely covered by the ‘discretionary function’ language of [the FSIA].” Burnett II, 292 F.Supp.2d at 20. As the Minister of Interior, Prince Naif oversees matters relating to Saudi public security, civil defense, fire service, police, passports, special security, and investigative forces. The Council of Ministers, of which he is a member, oversees the implementation of internal, external, financial, economic, educational, defense policies, and general affairs of state for the Kingdom. Prince Naif’s official responsibilities included managing Saudi relations with Osama bin Laden, see Prince Naif Mem. in Supp. Mot. to Dismiss at 2 (stating Prince Naif urged the Kingdom to strip bin Laden of his Saudi citizenship in 1994), and thus became a target of al Qaeda himself (see, e.g., Bierstein Aff. in Opp’n to Prince Sultan’s Mot. to Dismiss (fatwa issued by Osama bin Laden expressing extreme bitterness toward Saudi Royal family).) Therefore, Prince Naif’s administration of his responsibilities was “clearly ... grounded in social, economic, and political policy.” Burnett II, 292 F.Supp.2d at 21 (citing Varig Airlines, 467 U.S. at 814, 104 S.Ct. 2755)).\n \nThis Court lacks subject matter jurisdiction over Prince Salman and Prince Naif for their official acts. The FSIA does not immunize an official for his private tortious acts, however. See 28 U.S.C. § 1605(a)(5) (explaining torts exception is relevant to official’s official acts); Leutwyler, 184 F.Supp.2d at 286–87 (explaining officials are “deemed foreign states when they are sued for actions undertaken within the scope of their official capacities”). Accordingly, the Court will consider the appropriateness of exercising personal jurisdiction over Prince Salman and Prince Naif for their alleged personal acts below.\n \n\n\nII. Personal Jurisdiction\n[12] To survive the motions to dismiss under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(2), Plaintiffs must make a prima facie showing that personal jurisdiction exists over each moving Defendant. PDK Labs, Inc. v. Friedlander, 103 F.3d 1105, 1108 (2d Cir.1997). The Court reviews the complaints and affidavits in a light most favorable to Plaintiffs, id., but it does not accept conclusory allegations or draw “argumentative inferences.” Mende v. Milestone Tech., Inc., 269 F.Supp.2d 246, 251 (S.D.N.Y.2003) (citing Robinson v. Overseas Military Sales Corp., 21 F.3d 502, 507 (2d Cir.1994)).\n \n[13] Plaintiffs offer two bases for personal jurisdiction. First, New York’s long-arm statute, which the Court looks to in federal question cases in which no federal statute provides for national service of process or when the Court is sitting in diversity. PDK Labs, 103 F.3d at 1108; Bank Brussels Lambert v. Fiddler Gonzalez & Rodriguez, 305 F.3d 120, 124 (2d Cir.2002). *557 New York’s long-arm statute, C.P.L.R. 302(a)(2), provides for personal jurisdiction over a person who, personally or through an agent, “commits a tortious act within the state.” Because a co-conspirator can be considered an agent, see Chrysler Capital Corp. v. Century Power Corp., 778 F.Supp. 1260, 1266 (S.D.N.Y.1991), Plaintiffs argue that Defendants are subject to personal jurisdiction here based on the acts of their co-conspirators, the al Qaeda terrorists.\n \n[14] [15] [16] As this Court has previously explained, to establish personal jurisdiction on a conspiracy theory, Plaintiffs must make a prima facie showing of conspiracy and allege facts warranting an inference that the defendant was a member of the conspiracy. Terrorist Attacks I, 349 F.Supp.2d at 805. “To plead a valid cause of action for conspiracy ... a plaintiff must allege the primary tort and four elements: ‘(a) a corrupt agreement between two or more persons, (b) an overt act in furtherance of the agreement, (c) the parties’ intentional participation in the furtherance of a plan or purpose, and (d) the resulting damage or injury.’ ” Chrysler Capital Corp., 778 F.Supp. at 1267 (quoting Kashi v. Gratsos, 790 F.2d 1050, 1055 (2d Cir.1986)). Further, “[t]o warrant the inference that a defendant was a member of the conspiracy, Plaintiffs must show that ‘(a) the defendant had an awareness of the effects in New York of its activity; (b) the activity of the co-conspirators in New York was to the benefit of the out-of-state conspirators; and (c) the co-conspirators acting in New York acted ‘at the direction or under the control’ of or ‘at the request of or on behalf of’ the out-of-state defendant.” Terrorist Attacks I, 349 F.Supp.2d at 805 (quoting Chrysler Capital Corp., 778 F.Supp. at 1268–69). The Court must resolve the question of whether a conspiracy exists “based upon an independent examination of the factual allegations while mindful of its duty to draw all factual inferences in plaintiffs’ favor.” Daventree v. Republic of Azerbaijan, 349 F.Supp.2d 736, 760 (S.D.N.Y.2004).\n \nThe alternative basis for personal jurisdiction offered by Plaintiffs is found in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 4(k). Rule 4(k)(1) provides that service of process establishes personal jurisdiction when service is authorized by a federal statute. Here, the ATA provides for personal jurisdiction through its nationwide service of process provision. See 18 U.S.C. § 2334(a); Fed.R.Civ.P. 4(k)(1)(D). In situations in which Defendants were not served in the United States pursuant to the ATA, Rule 4(k)(2) acts as a personal jurisdiction gap-filler “in the enforcement of federal law.” Fed.R.Civ.P. 4(k)(2) advisory committee’s note. For the Court to exercise personal jurisdiction pursuant to Rule 4(k)(2), “there must be a federal claim, personal jurisdiction must not exist over the defendant in New York or any other state, and the defendant must have sufficient minimum contacts with the United States as a whole such that the exercise of jurisdiction does not violate Fifth Amendment due process.” Terrorist Attacks I, 349 F.Supp.2d at 807 (citing United States v. Int’l Bhd. of Teamsters, 945 F.Supp. 609, 617 (S.D.N.Y.1996)).\n \n[17] Under either basis offered by Plaintiffs, the exercise of personal jurisdiction must comport with due process requirements—there must be minimum contacts and the exercise of jurisdiction must be reasonable. Metro. Life Ins. Co. v. Robertson–Ceco Corp., 84 F.3d 560, 567 (2d Cir.1996); see also Terrorist Attacks I, 349 F.Supp.2d at 810–11 (reviewing due process requirements); Ungar v. Palestinian Auth., 153 F.Supp.2d 76, 87 (D.R.I.2001) (requiring minimum contacts with the United States for personal jurisdiction under *558 ATA). If personal jurisdiction is based on New York’s long-arm statute, the Fourteenth Amendment’s due process standards apply. If jurisdiction is based on Rule 4(k), the Fifth Amendment applies. The analysis is essentially the same. “The principal difference is that under the Fifth Amendment the court can consider the defendant’s contacts throughout the United States, while under the Fourteenth Amendment only contacts with the forum state may be considered.” Chew v. Dietrich, 143 F.3d 24, 28 n. 4 (2d Cir.1998).\n \nPlaintiffs claim that Rule 4(k)’s minimum contacts requirement is satisfied because the Defendants have purposefully directed their activities at the United States. See Terrorist Attacks I., 349 F.Supp.2d at 807 (reviewing the purposefully directed activities theory). This Court has held that to succeed on this theory, “Plaintiffs must make a prima facie showing of each Defendant’s personal or direct participation in the conduct giving rise to Plaintiffs’ injuries.” Id. at 809.5 The Court does not require direct participation in the attacks themselves, but at least participation in al Qaeda’s terrorist agenda.\n \n[18] In analyzing a defendant’s minimum contacts, courts distinguish between specific and general jurisdiction. “Specific jurisdiction exists when the forum exercises jurisdiction over the defendant in a suit arising out of the defendant’s contacts with that forum.” Terrorist Attacks I, 349 F.Supp.2d at 811 (citing Metro. Life Ins. 84 F.3d at 567–68). General jurisdiction is based on a defendant’s general business contacts with the forum. Because the defendant’s contacts are not related to the suit, a considerably higher level of contacts is generally required and the plaintiff must demonstrate the defendant’s continuous and systematic general business contacts with the forum. Metro. Life. Ins., 84 F.3d at 568; see also Helicopteros Nacionales de Colombia, S.A., 466 U.S. 408, 414–16, 104 S.Ct. 1868, 80 L.Ed.2d 404 (1984).\n \nIn most instances, Plaintiffs do not specify which basis for personal jurisdiction applies to each Defendant, or whether the Defendant was served in the United States pursuant to the ATA’s nationwide service of process provision. Accordingly, in analyzing Defendants’ motions, the Court considers as a threshold matter whether Plaintiffs have made a prima facie showing of the Defendant’s minimum contacts with the United States as a whole.\n \n\n\n A. Prince Salman and Prince Naif\nPlaintiffs seek to hold Prince Salman responsible for the attacks of September 11, theorizing that Prince Salman purposefully directed his activities at the United *559 States by contributing to and raising funds for IIRO, Sanabel-al Kheer, WAMY, and Al–Haramain. As for other contacts with the United States, Prince Salman owns stock in two United States corporations based in Texas, and, during a trip to the United States in 1989, he met with President George H.W. Bush and the governor of Maryland. (Plaintiffs’ Opp’n to Prince Salman Mot. to Dismiss at 21–22; see generally Parrett Aff.) Additionally, Plaintiffs claim that Prince Salman’s son attended school in California, had a residence in the United States, owned a corporation that breeds race horses in the United States, and is involved, through his estate, in a New Jersey lawsuit with a former employee. Id. They seek jurisdictional discovery to determine if Prince Salman has other contacts here.\n \nPlaintiffs do not allege that Prince Naif has any general contacts with the United States. Rather, they claim that he purposefully directed his activities toward the United States by making personal contributions to several Saudi-based charities. (Federal Compl. ¶¶ 442–43.)\n \n[19] Plaintiffs must make a prima facie showing that Prince Salman and Prince Naif have minimum contacts with the United States. The minimum contacts requirement is satisfied “if the defendant has ‘purposefully directed’ his activities at the residents of the forum.” Burger King v. Rudzewicz, 471 U.S. 462, 474, 105 S.Ct. 2174, 85 L.Ed.2d 528 (1985). Foreseeability is not enough, there must be “some act by which the defendant purposefully avails itself of the privilege of conducting activities within the forum.” Id. Donating money to established humanitarian organizations that may or may not have been diverting funds to support al Qaeda cannot be considered primary participation in intentional wrongdoing expressly aimed at the United States. Terrorist Attacks I, 349 F.Supp.2d at 809 (citing In re Magnetic Audiotape Antitrust Litig., 334 F.3d 204, 208 (2d Cir.2003)).\n \nAs to Prince Salman’s various limited contacts with the United States, they do not support general jurisdiction over him. The 1989 visit to the White House and Maryland is too far removed in time from the 2001 attacks. See, e.g., Metro. Life Ins. Co., 84 F.3d at 569 (explaining that a defendant’s “continuous and systematic” contacts with a forum must be examined over a period of time and finding a six-year period reasonable). Prince Salman’s deceased son’s contacts with the United States are irrelevant to this Court’s analysis. Keeton v. Hustler Magazine, Inc., 465 U.S. 770, 781 n. 13, 104 S.Ct. 1473, 79 L.Ed.2d 790 (“Each defendant’s contacts with the forum State must be assessed individually.”). Prince Salman’s ownership of shares in Texas corporations, on its own, cannot be considered sufficiently systematic and continuous to establish general jurisdiction. Helicopteros, 466 U.S. at 414–16, 104 S.Ct. 1868 (finding CEO’s travel to forum for contract negotiations, employees’ travel to forum for training, receipt of funds drawn on forum bank accounts, and purchase from forum companies were not contacts sufficiently systematic and continuous to establish general jurisdiction). Plaintiffs have not presented a genuine issue of jurisdictional fact such that discovery is necessary. Daventree, 349 F.Supp.2d at 761. Plaintiffs have not satisfied the constitutional requirement of showing that the Princes have minimum contacts with the United States. Accordingly, Prince Salman’s and Prince Naif’s motions to dismiss the Ashton, Burnett, and Federal complaints for lack of personal jurisdiction are granted.\n \n\n\n *560 B. Rabita Trust6\n[20] Plaintiffs allege that Rabita Trust is\n      a charitable organization which was created to organize the repatriation and rehabilitation of stranded Pakistanis from Bangladesh. Founded in 1988, the trust fund was started jointly by the government of Pakistan and the Saudi-based charity, [Defendant MWL]. Rabita Trust received the majority of its funding from the MWL and the Saudis, and [has] been involved with terrorism.\n(Ashton Compl. ¶ 521; Burnett Compl. ¶ 268.) The charity initially received funding from its founders to help relocate 250,000 displaced refugees. (Ashton Compl. ¶ 522; Burnett Compl. ¶ 269.) Plaintiffs assert that Rabita Trust has actually relocated only a few hundred refugees. (Ashton Compl. ¶ 522; Burnett Compl. ¶ 269.)\n \nOn October 12, 2001, the United States Treasury Department designated Rabita Trust a Specially Designated Global Terrorist Entity and froze its assets.7 (Ashton Compl. ¶ 312, 527; Burnett Compl. ¶ 236; Federal Compl. ¶¶ 117, 214.) Rabita Trust is allegedly related to various other charity Defendants and al Qaeda. For instance, as a subsidiary of MWL, it is a “sibling organization of the IIRO.” (Ashton Compl. ¶ 525; Burnett Compl. ¶ 272; Federal Compl. ¶ 113.) Through MWL and its own officers, Rabita Trust is also related to the SAAR Network. (Ashton Compl. ¶¶ 338, 526–28; Burnett Compl. ¶¶ 273–75; Federal Compl. ¶ 213.) Plaintiffs claim that “Rabita Trust is an al Qaeda front” and that its General Director, Wa‘el Julaidan, is a known al Qaeda member. (Ashton Compl. ¶ 523; Burnett Compl. ¶ 270; Federal Compl. ¶¶ 100, 121, 210.) In a list of orders obtained in a raid of BIF’s Sarajevo’s offices, investigators allegedly recovered a document from Osama bin Laden regarding the management of Islamic charities in which he urged the creation of a committee to receive and distribute donations to al Qaeda and suggests Rabita Trust’s participation. (Federal Compl. ¶¶ 195, 211.)\n \nRabita Trust claims that it does not have an office in the United States and that the complaints are devoid of any allegations that it directed money to terrorists. It admits that it has been designated a terrorist, but claims it does not have the same connections to the United States, bin Laden, and al Qaeda that Defendants Benevolence International Foundation (“BIF”) and Adel A.J. Batterjee had. See Terrorist Attacks I, 349 F.Supp.2d at 823–25 (finding Court had personal jurisdiction over Mr. Batterjee based on his designation as a global terrorist, his role with BIF, another designated terrorist, his *561 leadership of BIF’s United States operations, and his relationship with Osama bin Laden). It also argues that the document that Plaintiffs attribute to Osama bin Laden is similar to the Golden Chain, in that it lacks foundation and authentification. See Terrorist Attacks I., 349 F.Supp.2d at 817 (“The ‘Golden Chain’ is a group of documents that was discovered by Bosnian authorities searching the offices of charity Defendant BIF in March 2002. Plaintiffs claim the ‘Golden Chain’ contains a list of early direct donors to al Qaeda.”)\n \n[21] In assessing whether Rabita Trust has purposefully directed its activities at the United States under Rule 4(k), the Court is mindful of the executive branch’s designation of it as a SDGT. While the designation is not dispositive on its own, it does warrant some deference. In the realm of foreign affairs, the executive branch has access to “confidential sources of information [and] agents in the form of diplomatic, consular and other officials.” United States v. Curtiss–Wright Corp., 299 U.S. 304, 320, 57 S.Ct. 216, 81 L.Ed. 255 (1936). Entities are designated under Executive Order 13224 if the executive branch determines they are involved in terrorist activities. See Executive Order 13224 Fact Sheet. Courts enjoy great discretion in deciding whether to order jurisdictional discovery before resolving motions to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction. See, e.g., APWU v. Potter, 343 F.3d 619, 627 (2d Cir.2003). This Court finds that such discovery would be helpful in assessing whether any of Rabita Trust’s activities were directed at the United States. Accordingly, Rabita Trust’s motions to dismiss the Ashton, Burnett, and Federal complaints are denied without prejudice.\n \n\n\n C. Wa‘el Jalaidan8\n[22] The United States Department of Treasury has designated Defendant Jalaidan a terrorist,9 frozen his assets, and named him “one of the founders of al Qaeda.” (Ashton Compl. ¶ 304; Burnett Compl. ¶ 255; Federal Compl. ¶¶ 117, 91.) The Treasury Department “characterized [him] as having ‘directed organizations that have provided financial and logistical support to al-Qa-ida, [he] is the logistics chief of bin Laden’s organization and fought on bin Laden’s side in Afghanistan.’ ” (Ashton Compl. ¶¶ 304, 312, 523–24; Burnett Compl. ¶¶ 236, 255, 271; Federal Compl. ¶ 117; see also Federal Compl. ¶ 196 (claiming documents found in the Bosnian raid of BIF offices contained a note from Osama bin Laden to Jalaidan regarding al Qaeda’s need for weapons).) Further, Osama bin Laden and his lieutenant, Abu Zubaydah, allegedly “have acknowledged Wa‘el Julaidan as a known associate of their operations. Julaidan has been the head of various non-government organizations providing financial and logistical support to the al-Qa‘ida network.” (Ashton Compl. ¶¶ 304, 312, 341, 484; Burnett Compl. ¶ 236, 255.)\n \nJalaidan was in charge of the MWL in Peshawar, Pakistan and served as the General Director of Rabita Trust. (Ashton Compl. ¶ 304; Burnett Compl. ¶ 236, 255.) He “operated MWL offices that served in the early days of al Qaeda to attract and train holy warriors from around the world for the war in Afghanistan” and has “repeatedly aided and abetted terrorists.” (Ashton Compl. ¶¶ 304, *562 312; Burnett Compl. ¶ 255.) Jalaidan is also allegedly connected to Defendant SJRC. (Ashton Compl. ¶ 484; Federal Compl. ¶ 125.)\n \nDefendant Jalaidan argues that the allegations against him are simply allegations of guilt by association, and do not include any specificity regarding dates to put his actions in context. He urges the Court to not rely on his designation as a terrorist by the Treasury Department because he did not have an opportunity to rebut it.\n \nPlaintiffs do not claim to have served Mr. Jalaidan in the United States under the ATA’s nationwide service provision. Accordingly, Rule 4(k)(2) may provide a basis for personal jurisdiction. There are several federal claims at issue in this litigation and Plaintiffs have not made a prima facie showing that Mr. Jalaidan is subject to personal jurisdiction in New York or any other state. The Court turns to Mr. Jalaidan’s contacts with the United States. In addition to being designated as a global terrorist by the Department of Treasury, Mr. Jalaidan is alleged to be a founder and the logistical chief of al Qaeda, and affiliated with several other charities that are allegedly in al Qaeda’s fundraising network. In light of al Qaeda’s public declarations of war against the United States, someone who is alleged to be a founder, an admitted associate, and a provider of financial and logistical support to al Qaeda, has purposefully directed his activities at the United States such that the exercise of personal jurisdiction over him is reasonable.10 See Mwani v. bin Laden, 417 F.3d 1, 14 (C.A.D.C. 2005).\n \n\n\n D. IIRO11\n[23] Plaintiffs claim that IIRO has “materially supported terror around the globe, including Osama bin Laden and al Qaeda.” (Ashton Compl. ¶ 310; Burnett Compl. ¶¶ 234, 239; Federal Compl. ¶ 133.) In the early 1990s, IIRO “was rapidly becoming al Qaeda’s foremost charity used as a means to transfer funds, personnel, and other means of material support.” (Burnett Compl. ¶ 326; Federal Compl. ¶ 142.) Plaintiffs claim IIRO remains “firmly entrenched with Osama bin Laden’s al Qaeda organization” because of its support of an al Qaeda guest house in Egypt, its office’s close proximity to Osama bin Laden’s personal office in Sudan, and its relationship with bin Laden’s brother-in-law Defendant Mohammed Jamal Khalifa. (Ashton Compl. ¶¶ 310, 315, 317; Burnett Compl. ¶¶ 234, 239, 241.)\n \nMohammed Jamal Khalifa headed IIRO’s Philippines office, which served as a center of terrorist financing and training. (Ashton Compl. ¶ 310; Burnett Compl. ¶ 234; Federal Compl. ¶¶ 135–36.) Khalifa collected and laundered money for al Qaeda through IIRO’s Phillipines office. (Ashton Compl. ¶ 316; Burnett Compl. ¶ 240.) Through Khalifa, IIRO was allegedly involved with bombings in Jordan in 1993 and 1994, the 1993 attack on the World Trade Center, plots to assassinate former President Bill Clinton and the late Pope John Paul II and to simultaneously blow up twelve American airliners, and the 1998 Embassy bombings in Africa. (Ashton Compl. ¶¶ 310, 318, 510–12; Burnett Compl. ¶¶ 189, 234, 239 240, 242; Federal Compl. ¶¶ 136, 137, 139.)\n \n*563 Plaintiffs claim IIRO supported al Qaeda terrorists in other ways as well. One of the September 11 hijackers claimed to be working for IIRO’s Fazeh Ahed. (Ashton Compl. ¶ 322; Burnett Compl. ¶ 246.) IIRO allegedly funded the Taliban regime with $60,000,000. (Ashton Compl. ¶ 322; Burnett Compl. ¶ 246.) Pakistan deported 89 aid workers from the IIRO on the grounds that they were supporting al Qaeda. (Ashton Compl. ¶ 322; Burnett Compl. ¶ 246; Federal Compl. ¶ 144.) Plaintiffs claim IIRO funded al Qaeda training camps in Afghanistan. (Ashton Compl. ¶ 556; Federal Compl. ¶ 134 (basing allegations on declassified 1996 CIA report alleging IIRO funded six al Qaeda training camps, including those from which it planned, approved, and coordinated the September 11 attacks and where hijackers received training and indoctrination).) IIRO funded Egyptian al-Jihad, a branch of al Qaeda. (Burnett Compl. ¶ 243.) IIRO conducted a joint fundraising event with al-Haramain and WAMY in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia in December 1999. (Burnett Compl. ¶ 156.)\n \nDefendant MWL is the parent organization of IIRO and uses it as an “operational arm to perform many of its charitable activities.” (Ashton Compl. ¶ 298; Federal Compl. ¶¶ 130–31.) Plaintiffs claim IIRO also works with numerous other charities allegedly affiliated with al Qaeda, including SJRC, BIF, Global Relief Foundation, Taibah International, Islamic African Relief Agency, and WAMY. (Ashton Compl. ¶ 320; Burnett Compl. ¶¶ 172, 244; Federal Compl. ¶ 147.) The FBI raided IIRO’s offices in Virginia after September 11, 2001. (Ashton Compl. ¶ 322; Burnett Compl. ¶ 246.)\n \nPlaintiffs allege that IIRO operates under the name International Relief Organization (“IRO”) in the United States in Falls Church, Virginia, and that the IIRO and IRO transfer money to each other and have the same president. (Ashton Compl. ¶¶ 311, 320; Burnett Compl. ¶¶ 172, 235, 237; Federal Compl. ¶ 146 (U.S. branch established in 1991); see also Parrett Aff. Ex. 1 (attaching IRO’s 1991 certificate of incorporation in Virginia); id. Ex. 2 (attaching IRO’s 1993 certificate for doing business in Virginia under assumed name of International Islamic Relief Organization (IIRO)).) IIRO claims IRO was finally dissolved as a corporate entity in December 2002. (Saleh bin Abdallah Alsaikhan Decl. ¶ 10.)\n \nThe parties agree that this Court’s exercise of personal jurisdiction over IIRO depends on its contacts with the United States as a whole under Rule 4(k)(1). The Court looks, therefore, at IIRO’s contacts with the United States. It appears that IIRO was operating in the United States until December 2002. It is alleged to have supported an al Qaeda guest house. Through its relationship with Mohammed Jamal Khalifa, it has allegedly been involved in several al Qaeda attacks and plots for other attacks. It has allegedly funded the Taliban and al Qaeda training camps in Afghanistan. The Court finds that Plaintiffs have made a prima facie case that IIRO has purposefully directed its activities at the United States, thus satisfying the constitutional minimum contacts requirement. IIRO’s motions to dismiss the Ashton, Burnett, and Federal complaints are denied.\n \n\n\nIII. Failure to State a Claim\nIn these Rule 12(b)(6) motions to dismiss for failure to state a claim, the Court accepts as true the facts alleged in the complaints and draws all reasonable inferences in favor of Plaintiffs. Harris v. City of New York, 186 F.3d 243, 247 (2d Cir.1999). The complaints should be dismissed only if it appears beyond doubt *564 that Plaintiffs can prove no set of facts in support of their claims that would entitle them to relief. Id.; see also Hishon v. King & Spalding, 467 U.S. 69, 73, 104 S.Ct. 2229, 81 L.Ed.2d 59 (1984) (“A court may dismiss a complaint only if it is clear that no relief could be granted under any set of facts that could be proved consistent with the allegations.”).\n \nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 8(a)(2) requires “a short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief.” “This simplified notice pleading standard relies on liberal discovery rules and summary judgment motions to define disputed facts and issues and to dispose of unmeritorious claims.” Swierkiewicz v. Sorema, N.A., 534 U.S. 506, 512, 122 S.Ct. 992, 152 L.Ed.2d 1 (2002) (citing Conley v. Gibson, 355 U.S. 41, 47, 78 S.Ct. 99, 2 L.Ed.2d 80 (1957), Leatherman v. Tarrant County Narcotics Intelligence & Coordination Unit, 507 U.S. 163, 168–69, 113 S.Ct. 1160, 122 L.Ed.2d 517 (1993)). Plaintiffs must still give Defendants fair and adequate notice of their claims and the grounds on which they rest. See Simmons v. Abruzzo, 49 F.3d 83, 86 (2d Cir.1995). “[W]hile Swierkiewicz made clear that pleading a McDonnell Douglas prima facie case was not necessary to survive a motion to dismiss, it did not even remotely suggest that a pleading could survive dismissal when it contained only the barest of conclusory allegations without notice of the factual grounds on which they purport to be based.” Jackson v. BellSouth Telecomms., 372 F.3d 1250, 1270–71 (11th Cir.2004).\n \nThe Court limits its review to the facts stated in the complaints, documents attached to the complaints as exhibits, and documents incorporated by reference in the complaints. Dangler v. N.Y.C. Off Track Betting Corp., 193 F.3d 130, 138 (2d Cir.1999). For purposes of the RICO claims, the Court also reviews the RICO statements.\n \nPlaintiffs claim that Defendants in these lawsuits are liable for the attacks of September 11, in most instances, as co-conspirators, aiders, or abettors with al Qaeda. The Court has held that Defendants may be responsible for the September 11 attacks if they knowingly and intentionally provided material support to al Qaeda. See Terrorist Attacks I, 349 F.Supp.2d at 826. The complaints’ various theories of recovery merit a brief review here. See id. at 825–31.\n \nThe ATA provides a civil remedy for “[a]ny national of the United States injured in his or her person, property, or business by reason of an act of international terrorism, or his or estate, survivors, or heirs.” 18 U.S.C. § 2333(a). An act of international terrorism includes the provision of material support to terrorists, which is also a criminal act under the ATA. Boim II, 291 F.3d at 1015. The ATA’s criminal provisions define “material support or resources” as “currency or other financial securities, financial services, lodging, training, safehouses, false documentation or identification, communications equipment, facilities, weapons, lethal explosives, personnel, transportation, and other physical assets, except medicine or religious materials.” 18 U.S.C. § 2339A(b); see also Boim II, 291 F.3d at 1015 (finding conduct that violates § 2339A would be sufficient to meet the definition of “international terrorism” in § 2333). This Court adopts the Seventh Circuit’s requirement that Plaintiffs plead that Defendants knew of al Qaeda’s illegal activities, “that they desired to help those activities succeed, and they engaged in some act of helping the illegal activities.” Id. at 1023–24 (finding allegation that defendants are “ ‘front’ organizations with ostensibly legitimate purposes which are actually engaged in *565 fund-raising and money laundering in support of terrorist activities” and that those defendants “supplied money to Hamas to fund terrorist operations” were sufficient to survive 12(b)(6) motion).\n \nThe ATCA provides a basis for relief when an alien sues for a tort committed in violation of the law of nations. 28 U.S.C. § 1350; Kadic v. Karadzic, 70 F.3d 232, 238 (2d Cir.1995). Aircraft hijacking is considered a violation of international law, Kadic, 70 F.3d at 240, and the ATCA includes “actions premised on a theory of aiding and abetting and conspiracy.” Presbyterian Church of Sudan v. Talisman Energy, Inc., 244 F.Supp.2d 289, 311 (S.D.N.Y.2003). The ATCA, therefore, may provide a basis of recovery for those Plaintiffs who are aliens.\n \nThe Federal Plaintiffs include violations of civil RICO in their complaint. Section 1962(c) makes it unlawful “for any person employed by or associated with any enterprise engaged in ... interstate or foreign commerce, to conduct or participate, directly or indirectly, in the conduct of such enterprise’s affairs through a pattern of racketeering activity.” 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c). Section 1962(d) makes it “unlawful for any person to conspire to violate any of the provisions of subsections (a), (b), or (c) of this section.” Id. § 1962(d). Section 1964 provides for a private right of action to enforce the statute. Id. § 1964. Plaintiffs must plead an injury resulting from conduct of an enterprise through a pattern of racketeering activity. Sedima, S.P.R.L. v. Imrex Co., Inc., 473 U.S. 479, 491 (1985).\n \n[24] In Reves v. Ernst & Young, 507 U.S. 170, 113 S.Ct. 1163, 122 L.Ed.2d 525 (1993), the Supreme Court found that liability under § 1962(c) requires that a defendant be a participant “in the operation or management of the enterprise itself.” Id. at 185, 113 S.Ct. 1163. The Court stated:\n Once we understand the word “conduct” to require some degree of direction and the word “participate” to require some part in that direction, the meaning of § 1962(c) comes into focus. In order to “participate, directly or indirectly, in the conduct of such enterprise’s affairs,” one must have some part in directing those affairs. Of course, the word “participate” makes clear that RICO liability is not limited to those with primary responsibility for the enterprise’s affairs, just as the phrase “directly or indirectly” makes clear that RICO liability is not limited to those with a formal position in the enterprise, but some part in directing the enterprise’s affairs is required.\nId. at 179, 113 S.Ct. 1163. Therefore “to state a claim for liability under § 1962(c), Plaintiffs must allege that the [Defendants] participated ‘in the operation or management of the enterprise itself,’ which requires that these Defendants must have had some part in directing the enterprise’s affairs.” Redtail Leasing, Inc. v. Bellezza, No. 95 Civ. 5191(JFK), 1997 WL 603496, at *5 (S.D.N.Y. Sept.30, 1997).\n \n[25] [26] The TVPA provides a cause of action against individuals who under actual or apparent authority of any foreign nation subject an individual to torture or extrajudicial killing. 28 U.S.C. § 1350 note; Arndt v. UBS AG, 342 F.Supp.2d 132, 141 (E.D.N.Y.2004). The TVPA claims against Rabita Trust, IIRO, Success Foundation, and the SAAR Network entities are dismissed because these Defendants are not individuals. Arndt, 342 F.Supp.2d at 141. The TVPA claims against Tarik Hamdi, Abdulrahman Alamoudi, Wa‘el Jalaidan, and the SAAR Network executives are dismissed because there is no allegation that these Defendants were acting under *566 color of state law. In re: South African Apartheid Litigation, 346 F.Supp.2d 538, 548 (S.D.N.Y.2004) (finding no TVPA claim where complaint did not include allegation of individual acting under color of state law or with significant state aid)\n \nUnder New York law, Plaintiffs who are personal representatives who sufficiently allege that Defendants caused the death of their represented decedent will have also stated a claim for wrongful death and survival. N.Y. Est. Powers & Trusts Law §§ 5–4.1 (providing claim for wrongful death) and 11–3.2(b) (providing claim for survival).\n \n[27] [28] Plaintiffs bring various torts claims against these Defendants. As the Court explained in Terrorist Attacks I, the Federal Plaintiffs’ claims of assault, battery, and intentional infliction of emotional distress are time-barred, and therefore dismissed against Rabita Trust, Wa‘el Jalaidan, IIRO, Tarik Hamdi, Abdulrahman Alamoudi, Mar–Jac Poultry, and the SAAR Network executives. Terrorist Attacks I, 349 F.Supp.2d at 829; N.Y. C.P.L.R. 215(3). To the extent the Ashton and Burnett Plaintiffs plead that Defendants are liable for the September 11 attacks as co-conspirators or aiders or abettors of al Qaeda, they will have pled a claim for relief for intentional infliction of emotional distress, which requires extreme and outrageous conduct, intent to cause severe emotional distress, a causal connection between the conduct and the injury, and severe emotional distress. See Stuto v. Fleishman, 164 F.3d 820, 827 (2d Cir.1999). The Federal Plaintiffs’ trespass claims require “the interference with a person’s right to possession of real property either by an unlawful act or a lawful act performed in an unlawful manner.” N.Y. State Nat’l Org. for Women v. Terry, 886 F.2d 1339, 1361 (2d Cir.1989). Provided the Federal Plaintiffs plead that Defendants here acted in concert with the September 11 hijackers, they will have stated a claim for relief for trespass. Finally, the negligence claims against the Defendants are dismissed because the complaints do not allege or identify a duty owed to Plaintiffs by these Defendants. Terrorist Attacks I, 349 F.Supp.2d at 830–31.\n \nTo summarize, the TVPA and negligence claims against all of the Defendants moving for dismissal under Rule 12(b)(6) here are dismissed. The Federal claims of assault and battery and intentional infliction of emotional distress are also dismissed. The Court reviews the complaints to determine if they state a claim for relief under the ATA and RICO. If Plaintiffs state a claim for relief under the ATA, they will have also stated a claim for wrongful death and survival, the Federal Plaintiffs will have stated a claim for trespass, and the Ashton and Burnett Plaintiffs will have stated claims for intentional infliction of emotional distress. Plaintiffs who are aliens will have also stated a claim for relief under the ATCA.\n \n\n\n A. Tarik Hamdi12\n[29] The Burnett and Federal Plaintiffs allege that after 1996, when Osama bin Laden declared war on Americans, Tarik Hamdi allegedly arranged for the delivery of a battery for a satellite phone used by Osama bin Laden. (Burnett Compl. ¶¶ 245, 581 (citing arguments of then-AUSA Kenneth Karas); Federal RICO Statement Ex. A.) Osama bin Laden allegedly used that phone and battery pack to coordinate and order the African embassy bombings. (Federal RICO Statement Ex. A.)\n \n*567 Plaintiffs also allege that Hamdi is affiliated with various al Qaeda operatives. For instance, he has connections with the Committee for the Defense of Legitimate Rights (“CDLR”) and the Advice and Reformation Committee (“ARC”), two dissident Saudi groups with ties to Osama bin Laden. (Burnett Compl. ¶¶ 561–62.) A radical Arabic publication allegedly provided a phone number registered in Hamdi’s name when it advertised the contact information of CDLR’s U.S. branch. (Burnett Compl. ¶ 580.) CDLR published bin Laden’s October 12, 1996 fatwa on the Muslim Students Association listserve, the “MSA News.” (Burnett Compl. ¶ 584.) Plaintiffs claim that ARC allegedly serves as al Qaeda’s front in the United Kingdom and facilitates communication to and from Osama bin Laden. (Burnett Compl. ¶¶ 562, 564, 575, 577, 584–85.) Hamdi is also alleged to have connections to Khalid al-Fawwaz, one of the masterminds of the embassy bombings. (Burnett Compl. ¶ 582.) Finally, Plaintiffs claim Hamdi is a co-conspirator with the SAAR Network. He worked at IIIT in Herndon, Virginia, “the central address surrounding the SAAR Foundation raids, evidence and investigation.” (Burnett Compl. ¶¶ 267, 583; Federal Compl. ¶ 146, 224.)\n \nHamdi asserts that he is a journalist. He argues that ABC requested that he arrange the interview with Osama bin Laden and that he did not purchase the phone or battery pack. He claims he has not had any ties to CDLR since 1995. He admits that he worked at IIIT as an editor. These factual disputes cannot be resolved on a 12(b)(6) motion.\n \n[30] The Federal Plaintiffs have not alleged that Mr. Hamdi participated in the operation or management of any enterprise. The RICO claims against Mr. Hamdi must be dismissed. See Redtail Leasing, Inc. v. Bellezza, 1997 WL 603496 at *5. Plaintiffs allege that Mr. Hamdi knew about bin Laden’s terrorist activities at the time he procured a phone for him because the first fatwas had already been issued. They allege he provided material support to bin Laden in the form of a satellite phone battery. The ATA includes communications equipment in its definition of material support. See 18 U.S.C. § 2339A(b). “[E]ven small donations made knowingly and intentionally in support of terrorism may meet the standard for civil liability in section 2333.” Boim II, 291 F.3d at 1015. These allegations are sufficient to notify Mr. Hamdi of the claims against him. Tarik Hamdi’s motions to dismiss the Burnett and Federal complaints are denied.\n \n\n\n B. Abdulrahman Alamoudi13\nDefendant Abdulrahman Alamoudi has connections with several organizations that the Burnett and Federal Plaintiffs claim support terrorism. He is Vice President of Taibah International Aid Association’s U.S. branch. (Federal Compl. ¶ 245.) Plaintiffs claim Taibah was implicated in the 1998 embassy bombings. (Federal Compl. ¶¶ 66, 239, 244.) Additionally, Taibah allegedly works closely with designated-terrorist Global Relief Fund and SHC and has diverted funds to al Qaeda and its affiliates in Bosnia. (Federal Compl. ¶¶ 241, 243.) Through Taibah, Alamoudi is also connected with several SAAR Network entities, including American Muslim Council, American Muslim Foundation, Hajj Foundation, Happy Hearts Trust, IIRO, and Success Foundation. (Federal Compl. ¶¶ 245, 490; Burnett Compl. ¶¶ 237, 248.) He allegedly used his SAAR connections to funnel money to al Qaeda *568 through various fronts. (Federal Compl. ¶ 247.)\n \nPlaintiffs allege that Alamoudi has openly stated his support for Hamas and Hezbollah, both designated terrorist organizations that cooperate with al Qaeda. (Federal Compl. ¶¶ 50, 53 Burnett Compl. ¶ 237.)\n \nIn August 2003, Alamoudi was detained at Heathrow Airport on his way to Syria. Customs officers seized approximately $340,000 in sequentially numbered bills, two U.S. passports, and one Yemeni passport. (Federal Compl. ¶ 246.) Alamoudi was arrested by U.S. officials at Washington Dulles Airport on September 28, 2003. (Federal Compl. ¶ 247.) He subsequently pleaded guilty to unlicensed travel to and commerce with Libya, false statements on his naturalization application, and tax offenses involving Libyan financial transactions. (Federal Mem. in Opp’n at 6.) He is currently serving a twenty-three year sentence. (Id.)\n \n[31] [32] [33] The Burnett complaint does not allege any act taken by Mr. Alamoudi that could be considered the provision of material support for al Qaeda. The Federal complaint is sustained inasmuch as it claims that Mr. Alamoudi funneled money to al Qaeda through the charities with which he was involved. (Federal Compl. ¶¶ 241, 243.) See 18 U.S.C. § 2339(A) (including “currency or other financial securities [and] financial services” in definition of material support). This claim puts Mr. Alamoudi on notice that he is alleged to have provided financial material support to al Qaeda. Because the Federal complaint does not allege that Mr. Alamoudi had any role in directing an enterprise, however, the RICO claims against Mr. Alamoudi are dismissed. In sum, Mr. Alamoudi’s motion to dismiss the Burnett complaint is granted; his motion to dismiss the Federal complaint is denied.\n \n\n\n C. Success Foundation14\n[34] The Burnett Plaintiffs claim that Success Foundation is a sister company to Defendant IIRO and that it “sends money back and forth with the IIRO and IRO” and other sponsors of terror. (Burnett Compl. ¶ 235.) If given the opportunity to replead its allegations against Success, the Plaintiffs would allege that, in 1998, Success Foundation entered into a contract to act as an agent for Defendant Taibah, which has since been designated a global terrorist.\n \nThe complaint does not allege that Success Foundation knew the money it was transferring between IIRO and IRO would somehow assist al Qaeda, nor does it allege facts showing that Success Foundation knew the other unnamed organizations to which it transferred money were in the business of supporting terrorism. See Boim II, 291 F.3d at 1012 (“To hold the defendants liable for donating money without knowledge of the donee’s intended criminal use of the funds would impose strict liability. Nothing in the language of the statute or its structure or history supports that formulation.”). The Burnett complaint is against Success Foundation is dismissed without prejudice.\n \n\n\n D. Wa‘el Jalaidan\n[35] For the reasons the Court found that it has personal jurisdiction over Mr. Jalaidan, the Court finds the Plaintiffs have stated a claim for relief against him. Plaintiffs have alleged facts, that if true, would be sufficient to prove that he knowingly provided material support to al Qaeda in the form of financial and logistical support. See 18 U.S.C. § 2339(A) (including *569 “currency or other financial securities, financial services, ... weapons, [and] personnel” in definition of material support). The Federal complaint does not allege that Jalaidan directed an enterprise and the RICO claim is dismissed. Wa‘el Jalaidan’s motions to dismiss the Ashton, Burnett, and Federal complaints are denied\n \n\n\n E. IIRO\n[36] Similarly, for the reasons the Court found that Plaintiffs made a prima facie demonstration that IIRO has purposefully directed its activities at the United States, the Court finds they have stated a claim under the ATA in that IIRO has allegedly funded al Qaeda training camps in Afghanistan, supported al Qaeda guest houses, and been involved in other terrorist attacks and plots. See 18 U.S.C. § 2339(A) (including “currency or other financial securities, financial services, ... weapons, [and] personnel” in definition of material support). IIRO’s motions to dismiss the Ashton, Burnett, and Federal complaints are denied.\n \n\n\n F. Rabita Trust\n[37] Rabita Trust moves to dismiss the complaints against it for failure to state a claim. These motions are denied without prejudice until this Court determines whether it has personal jurisdiction over Rabita Trust.\n \n\n\n G. SAAR Network Defendants15\n\n\n 1. Entities\nThe Burnett and Ashton complaints’ allegations against the SAAR Network entities are substantially similar to one another.16 Paragraph 267 of the Burnett complaint and paragraph 339 of the Ashton complaint both state:\n \n Co-conspirators, material sponsors, and/or aiders and abettors of the SAAR Network include Defendants ... African Muslim Agency, ... Grove Corporate, Inc., Heritage Education Trust, International Institute of Islamic Thought, Mar–Jac Investments, Inc., Mar–Jac Poultry, Inc., ... Reston Investments, Inc., ... Safa Trust, ... and York Foundation, all located doing business or registered to do business in the United States.\nIn support of their claims against these Defendants, Plaintiffs rely primarily on their allegations against the “SAAR Foundation and network.” (See Burnett Compl. ¶¶ 261–67; Ashton Compl. ¶¶ 333–39.) The SAAR Foundation, allegedly a financial sponsor of terror, was formed in the 1970s by a group of Muslim scholars and scientists. (Burnett Compl. ¶ 261; Ashton Compl. ¶ 333.) It was incorporated in Virginia in 1983 and dissolved in December 2000. (Burnett Compl. ¶ 261; Ashton Compl. ¶ 333.) Its largest donor is the al Rajhi family of Saudi Arabia. (Burnett Compl. ¶ 261; Ashton Compl. ¶ 333.)\n \nThe complaints claim that over one hundred “affiliated organizations” are registered or are doing business at one of the SAAR Foundation’s addresses in Herndon, Virginia, but many “do not maintain a physical presence at that address, or elsewhere.” *570 (Burnett Compl. ¶ 262; Ashton Compl. ¶ 334.) The complaints further allege that many of the “SAAR Network” organizations’ offices in Herndon were raided in March 2002 as part of Operation Greenquest to investigate “potential money laundering and tax evasion activities and their ties to terrorist groups such as ... al Qaeda as well as individual terrorists ... (including) Osama bin Laden.” (Burnett Compl. ¶ 263; Ashton Compl. ¶ 335.) As noted above, Plaintiffs claim that the entity Defendants are among numerous co-conspirators, material sponsors, and/or aiders and abettors of the SAAR Network. (Burnett Compl. ¶ 267; Ashton Compl. ¶ 339.) The Plaintiffs also refer the Court to their allegations regarding charity sponsors of terror. (See, e.g., Burnett Compl. ¶¶ 150–53 (alleging, for example, that charity Defendants “are used as terrorist fronts, to mask money transfers and provide cover for terrorist operatives”).) Additionally, the Ashton complaint claims that IIIT received its “operating expenses” from SAAR and “in turn financed two Florida charitable organizations accused of being cells for Islamic Jihad in Florida.” (Id. ¶ 579.)\n \nUnlike the SAAR Network entities whose motions to dismiss the Federal complaint the Court considered in its previous opinion and order, see Terrorist Attacks I, 349 F.Supp.2d at 822–23, these Defendants do not dispute that this Court has personal jurisdiction over them. Although each of these moving Defendants filed a separate motion to dismiss, their arguments in favor of dismissal are similar.17 They argue that, even “assum[ing] that plaintiffs have stated a claim against the ‘SAAR Network,’ ” (see, e.g., African Muslim Agency’s Mem. in Supp. Mot. to Dismiss at 3, n.1) the complaints must be dismissed because they contain only conclusory allegations that they are “co-conspirator[s], material sponsor[s], and/or aider[s] and abettor[s] of the SAAR Network.” (Burnett Compl. ¶ 267; Ashton Compl. ¶ 339.) Further, they argue that the complaints must be dismissed because they do not allege that they donated any money improperly, or with the knowledge that it would be given to Osama bin Laden, al Qaeda, or to any other charity allegedly funneling money to terrorists.\n \n[38] Plaintiffs offer the legal conclusion that the SAAR Network entities conspired with the SAAR Network. These Defendants, however, have no notice of the factual grounds on which Plaintiffs’ claims of conspiracy are based. See Jackson, 372 F.3d at 1271 (explaining Swierkiewicz does not permit bare conclusory allegations without notice of the factual grounds on which they purport to be based); see also Bodner v. Banque Paribas, 114 F.Supp.2d 117, 125 (E.D.N.Y.2000) (noting the Second Circuit “has dismissed complaints which plead conspiracy in vague or conclusory terms and which do not allege specific instances of misconduct in furtherance of the conspiracy”); Ying Jing Gan v. City of New York, 996 F.2d 522, 534 (2d Cir.1993) (explaining that on a Rule 12(b)(6) motion, “legal conclusions, deductions or opinions couched as factual allegations are not given a presumption of truthfulness”) (internal quotations omitted)). The Burnett complaint against African Muslim Agency, Grove Corporate, Heritage Education Trust, International Institute of Islamic Thought, Mar–Jac Investments, Mar–Jac Poultry, Reston Investments, Safa Trust, *571 and York Foundation is therefore dismissed without prejudice. For the same reasons, the Ashton complaint against Mar–Jac Poultry is dismissed without prejudice.\n \n[39] The Ashton complaint alleges one action by IIIT in support of its claims—that it allegedly financed two charitable organizations in Florida accused of being Islamic Jihad cells. The complaint does not allege that IIIT knew these charities were Islamic Jihad cells or whether and how these cells participated in or contributed to al Qaeda’s agenda of terror. See Boim II, 291 F.3d at 1011–12 (making donations to an alleged terrorist group, without “knowledge of and intent to further payee’s violent criminal acts,” cannot sustain cause of action). Accordingly, the Ashton complaint against IIIT is dismissed without prejudice.\n \n[40] In support of the claim that Mar–Jac Poultry is a material sponsor of terrorism, Plaintiffs allege two acts: first, that it donated money to African Muslim Agency, which the Plaintiffs claim was later “laundered,” and second, that it donated money to unnamed SAAR Network entities, which was later forwarded to al Qaeda. (See Federal RICO Statement Applicable to SAAR Network Entities at 5(f) and Ex. A.) The RICO claim against Mar–Jac Poultry is dismissed because it is not alleged that Mar–Jac had any role in directing an enterprise, see Redtail Leasing, Inc., 1997 WL 603496, at *5. The Federal complaint does not provide Mar–Jac Poultry with notice as to how it could be liable for the terrorist attacks. See Boim II, 291 F.3d at 1012 (“To hold the defendants liable for donating money without knowledge of the donee’s intended criminal use of the funds would impose strict liability. Nothing in the language of the statute or its structure or history supports that formulation.”). Mar–Jac’s motion to dismiss the Federal complaint is therefore granted.\n \n\n\n 2. Executives\n[41] Taha Al–Awani, Muhammad Ashraf, M. Omar Ashraf, M. Yaqub Mirza, and Iqbal Unus are SAAR Network executives who are mentioned once in the Federal complaint in a long list of Defendants who allegedly “have aided and abetted, conspired with, and provided material support and resources to, defendant al Qaida and/or affiliated FTOs, associations, organizations or persons, as described herein.” (Federal Compl. ¶ 66.) The complaint does not include any other allegations against these Defendants.\n \nThe Federal complaint alleges that Jamal Barzinji, another SAAR Network executive who moves to dismiss the complaint, is a Saudi national who, “through his various for-profit enterprises and involvement with charities and individuals operating within al Qaida’s infrastructure, has long provided material support and resources to al Qaida.” (Federal Compl. ¶¶ 490–91.) Barzinji has served as a board member of, or been associated with, several SAAR Network entities, including IIIT, WAMY, Safa Trust, Mar–Jac Poultry, and SAAR Foundation. Id. ¶ 490 (claiming that while he was the President of Safa Trust, he “held authority over eighteen bank accounts”). He is a business associate of the designated terrorist Yousef Nada. (Id.) According to unnamed federal authorities, Barzinji “committed and conspired to: transit money internationally for the purpose of promoting offenses against foreign nations involving murder or the destruction of property by means of explosive, fire, kidnapping or extortion ...; provide material support or resources to foreign terrorist organizations ...; and provide material support or conceal or disguise the source of ownership of material support *572 intended for use in preparation for or in carrying out a terrorist act.” (Id.)\n \nThe RICO statement provides additional associations between each of these SAAR Network executives and the SAAR Network. (See Federal RICO Statement Applicable to the SAAR Network Executives at Ex. A (alleging in their roles as executives of SAAR Network entities, each of these Defendants committed multiple acts of conspiracy to commit multiple crimes).) Specifically, Taha Al–Alwani was President of IIIT and an officer of Heritage Education Trust; Muhammad Ashraf was an officer and/or director of Sterling Investment Group, Sterling Charitable Gift Fund, and York Foundation; M. Omar Ashraf was an officer and/or director of Grove Corporate Plaza, Mar–Jac Investments, and Sterling Charitable Gift Fund; Yaqub Mirza served as an officer and/or director of African Muslim Agency, Mar–Jac Investments, Mar–Jac Poultry, Reston Investments, SAAR Foundation, Safa Trust, where he was the principal signatory on Safa Group checks, and York International; Iqbal Yunus was a director of Child Development Foundation, a SAAR Network entity, and was associated with Sterling Charitable Gift Fund, and Sterling Management Group; finally, Jamal Barzinji was president of Safa Trust and a director of Mar–Jac Poultry, Reston Investments, IIIT, and Safa Trust. (Id. at 5(f) and Ex. A.)\n \nThe complaint does not state a claim for relief against Taha Al–Awani, Muhammad Ashraf, M. Omar Ashraf, M. Yaqub Mirza, or Iqbal Unus on a civil RICO theory or under the ATA. Reading the complaint as a whole and considering the overlap of executives among the SAAR Network entities, the complaint does not adequately provide these Defendants with notice as to how they provided material support to al Qaeda terrorists. See Boim II, 291 F.3d at 1023 (explaining a claim under the ATA must include allegation that defendant knew about terrorists’ illegal activities, defendant wanted to help those activities succeed, and defendant engaged in an act of helping). The Federal complaint against Taha Al–Awani, Muhammad Ashraf, M. Omar Ashraf, M. Yaqub Mirza, and Iqbal Unus is dismissed without prejudice.\n \n[42] [43] Jamal Barzinji controlled several bank accounts. (Federal Compl. ¶ 490.) He has allegedly transmitted money internationally for terrorist purposes. (Id.) He allegedly made these transfers to support al Qaeda. (Id. at ¶¶ 490–91.) The Federal Plaintiffs do not allege that Mr. Barzinji participated in the operation or management of their claimed RICO enterprise, and the RICO claim against him is dismissed. Reves, 507 U.S. at 179, 113 S.Ct. 1163. But Mr. Barzinji does have sufficient notice of the claims against him regarding his alleged provision of material support in the form of financial transactions to al Qaeda. See 18 U.S.C. § 2339(A) (including provision of “currency or other financial securities [and] financial services” in definition of material support) Accordingly, his motion to dismiss the Federal complaint is denied.\n \n\n\nIV. NCB’s Motion for Reconsideration\nIn deciding NCB’s motions to dismiss the Ashton and Burnett complaints, the Court ruled that NCB’s status as a foreign sovereign for purposes of immunity under the FSIA was unclear. It also questioned whether it had personal jurisdiction over NCB. The Court ordered limited jurisdictional discovery on both issues. Terrorist Attacks I, 349 F.Supp.2d at 792, 820. In light of the possible lack of subject matter and personal jurisdiction, the Court refrained from deciding NCB’s motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim. NCB *573 moves for reconsideration of those decisions.\n \n\n\n A. Standard\n[44] [45] A motion for reconsideration is appropriate where a court overlooks “controlling decisions or factual matters that were put before it on the underlying motion ... and which, had they been considered, might have reasonably altered the result before the court.” Range Road Music, Inc. v. Music Sales Corp., 90 F.Supp.2d 390, 392 (S.D.N.Y.2000); see also Shrader v. CSX Transp. Inc., 70 F.3d 255, 257 (2d Cir.1995) (“The standard for granting a motion [for reconsideration] is strict, and ... will generally be denied unless the moving party can point to controlling decisions or data that the court overlooked....”). A motion for reconsideration may also be granted to “correct a clear error or prevent manifest injustice.” Doe v. New York City Dep’t of Soc. Servs., 709 F.2d 782, 789 (2d Cir.1983).\n \n\n\n B. The Court Will Consider NCB’s Personal Jurisdiction Defense First\nNCB offers two bases for reconsideration. First, NCB argues that even if the Court becomes assured of its subject matter and personal jurisdiction over NCB, Plaintiffs’ claims are doomed because the Court dismissed similar claims against Al Rajhi Bank, Saudi American Bank, and Arab Bank. NCB contends that Center for Reproductive Law & Policy v. Bush, 304 F.3d 183, 194–95 (2d Cir.2002), supports its theory that the Court does not need to establish jurisdiction over NCB because the Court’s dismissal of other Saudi banks “foreordains” NCB’s dismissal on 12(b)(6) grounds. Alternatively, NCB urges the Court to limit this litigation’s intrusion on Saudi Arabia and postpone resolution of its FSIA immunity defense until after the personal jurisdiction question is resolved.\n \nThe Ashton and Burnett Plaintiffs argue that the Court should not consider NCB’s reliance on Bush because it was not raised in NCB’s original motion to dismiss. Moreover, they are adamant that jurisdictional questions must be resolved first. See Steel Co. v. Citizens for a Better Environment, 523 U.S. 83, 94–95, 118 S.Ct. 1003, 140 L.Ed.2d 210 (1998) (“The requirement that jurisdiction be established as a threshold matter springs from the nature and limits of the judicial power of the United States and is inflexible and without exception.”) (internal citation and quotations omitted). And in Plaintiffs’ view, the subject matter jurisdiction question must be resolved before the Court addresses personal jurisdiction. See Reiss v. Societe Centrale Du Groupe Des Assurances Nationales, 235 F.3d 738, 746 (2d Cir.2000) (“The initial question to be answered in this case is not whether there is personal jurisdiction within the meaning of the New York [C.P.L.R.] but whether there is subject matter jurisdiction within the meaning of the [FSIA].”). Plaintiffs submit that it would be inefficient to separate the personal jurisdiction discovery from the FSIA discovery since the two inquiries are related. Finally, Plaintiffs argue that the Court’s rulings on the other Saudi banks’ Rule 12(b)(6) motions cannot apply to NCB because the allegations against the various banks are not identical.\n \nIn Bush, following the Supreme Court’s instructions in Steel Co., the district court dismissed the case for lack of subject matter jurisdiction after finding plaintiffs lacked standing to sue. On appeal, the Second Circuit found the case “exceptional,” because twelve years earlier it had “entertained and rejected, on the merits, the same constitutional challenge to the provision at issue.” Bush, 304 F.3d at 186; *574 see also Planned Parenthood Fed. of Am. v. Agency of Int’l Devl., 915 F.2d 59 (2d Cir.1990) (rejecting same constitutional challenge to same governmental provision). It explained two exceptions to the general rule that courts “ordinarily ... are not to assume the existence of jurisdiction in favor of reaching an ‘easier’ merits issue.” Bush, 304 F.3d at 193 (quoting Fidelity Partners, Inc. v. First Trust, Co. of N.Y., 142 F.3d 560, 565 (2d Cir.1998)).\n \nThe only exception relevant here is “in those ‘particular circumstances’ where the outcome on the merits has been ‘foreordained’ by another case such that the ‘jurisdictional question could have no effect on the outcome,’ provided the court ‘does not use the pretermission of the jurisdictional question as a device for reaching a question of law that otherwise would have gone unaddressed.’ ” Bush, 304 F.3d at 194 (quoting Steel Co., 523 U.S. at 98, 118 S.Ct. 1003). The exception stems from Secretary of Navy v. Avrech, 418 U.S. 676, 94 S.Ct. 3039, 41 L.Ed.2d 1033 (1974), in which the Supreme Court dismissed a constitutional challenge to a governmental provision on the merits before reaching the jurisdiction question because the Court had earlier rejected a similar constitutional challenge to the same provision in Parker v. Levy, 417 U.S. 733, 94 S.Ct. 2547, 41 L.Ed.2d 439 (1974). See Bush, 304 F.3d at 194 (describing Avrech and Parker ). Accordingly, in Bush, the Second Circuit skipped the initial-and “novel”—standing question because that analysis would have been rendered “advisory” by “a controlling decision of this Court [that] has already entertained and rejected the same constitutional challenge to the same [governmental] provision.” Id. at 195 (limiting holding to constitutional challenges to governmental provisions).\n \nNCB’s reliance on Bush cannot prevail here. The exception relied on in Bush is limited to constitutional challenges to governmental provisions. Bush, 304 F.3d at 195; see also Steel Co., 523 U.S. at 99, 118 S.Ct. 1003. Here, the merits of NCB’s liability for the attacks of September 11 do not present a constitutional challenge to a governmental provision such that skipping the jurisdiction question would be appropriate.\n \nIn its alternative argument for reconsideration, NCB requests that the Court postpone resolution of the subject matter jurisdiction question posed by the FSIA until NCB’s personal jurisdiction defense is resolved. NCB argues that such a course would lead to its quicker dismissal from the litigation and would limit the intrusion into Saudi affairs since personal jurisdiction discovery would involve only NCB’s contacts with the United States and not Saudi Arabia’s relationship to NCB.\n \nThe Supreme Court and Second Circuit agree that there are certain circumstances in which it is appropriate to give priority to the personal jurisdiction inquiry. See Ruhrgas AG v. Marathon Oil Co., 526 U.S. 574, 578, 588, 119 S.Ct. 1563, 143 L.Ed.2d 760 (1999) (holding “there is no unyielding jurisdictional hierarchy ... [and] there are circumstances in which a district court appropriately accords priority to a personal jurisdiction inquiry” and finding no abuse of discretion where a court resolves a straightforward personal jurisdiction question before a novel subject matter jurisdiction question); Cantor Fitzgerald v. Peaslee, 88 F.3d 152, 155 (2d Cir.1996) (upholding district court’s decision to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction before considering whether it had subject matter jurisdiction and finding “[o]n some occasions ... considerations of judicial economy and restraint may persuade the court to avoid a difficult question of subject-matter jurisdiction when the case may be disposed of on a simpler *575 ground”). Further, deference to foreign sovereigns under the FSIA “need not imply priority of immunity determination.... If one (or more) of the other jurisdictional defenses hold out the promise of being cheaply decisive, and the defendant wants it decided first, it may well be best to grapple with it (or them) first.” In re Minister Papandreou, 139 F.3d 247, 254 (D.C.Cir.1998).\n \n[46] Here, the Court finds that the personal jurisdiction issue raised by NCB is “straightforward” when compared to the more “difficult” subject matter jurisdiction question posed by NCB’s status within the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. See Ruhrgas, 526 U.S. at 588, 119 S.Ct. 1563; see also Terrorist Attacks I, 349 F.Supp.2d at 789–792 (analyzing NCB’s status as a foreign sovereign). Additionally, NCB acknowledges that personal jurisdiction discovery will only involve it, its relationship to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is sufficiently remote that an inquiry into NCB’s contacts with the United States will not intrude on the inner workings of the Kingdom’s government. Finally, discovery regarding NCB’s FSIA defense would necessarily subject the Kingdom to discovery, which the Court is hesitant to do unnecessarily. See First City, Texas–Houston, N.A. v. Rafidain Bank, 150 F.3d 172, 176 (2d Cir.1998); see also Arriba Ltd. v. Petroleos Mexicanos, 962 F.2d 528, 534 (5th Cir.1992) (recommending that “discovery should be ordered circumspectly and only to verify allegations of specific facts crucial to an immunity determination”).\n \nFor all the foregoing reasons, the Court reconsiders its order regarding simultaneous subject matter and personal jurisdiction discovery. See Shrader, 70 F.3d at 257 (“[I]n light of [defendant’s] introduction of additional relevant case law ... we cannot say that reconsider[ation is] an abuse of discretion.”). Further inquiry into NCB’s status as a foreign sovereign is postponed until the parties have completed their personal jurisdiction discovery and this Court has determined whether it has personal jurisdiction over NCB. See Ruhrgas, 526 U.S. at 588, 119 S.Ct. 1563; In re Arbitration Between Monegasque De Reasurrances S.A.M., 311 F.3d 488, 498 (2d Cir.2002) (noting “dismissal for want of personal jurisdiction is independent of the merits and does not require subject-matter jurisdiction”) (quoting In re Minister Papandreou, 139 F.3d at 255–56).\n \n\n\nV.

The Court consolidated Barrera v. al Qaeda Islamic Army, 03 Civ. 7038, with Ashton on December 6, 2004. Similarly, at Plaintiffs’ request, the Court consolidated Salvo v. al Qaeda Islamic Army, 03 Civ. 5071, with Burnett on August 16, 2005.\n\t\n2\n\tPrince Salman moves to dismiss the Ashton, Burnett, and Federal complaints.\n\t\n3\n\tPrince Naif moves to dismiss the Ashton, Burnett, and Federal complaints.\n\t\n4\n\tThe French Interior Minister named one charity, the World Islamic League, during his meeting. Plaintiffs claim this is another name for the Muslim World League.\n\t\n5\n\tPlaintiffs bring the Court’s attention to Mwani v. bin Laden, 417 F.3d 1 (D.C.Cir.2005), in which the D.C. Circuit found that Osama bin Laden and al Qaeda were subject to personal jurisdiction under Rule 4(k)(2) because they had “engaged in unabashedly malignant actions directed at and felt in this forum.” Id. at 13 (citing, among other examples, bin Laden’s and al Qaeda’s orchestration of the Nairobi embassy bombing and the 1993 World Trade Center bombing, their plot to bomb various landmarks in New York City, their fatwas against Americans, the criminal indictment against them arising from the Nairobi attack, and the conclusions of the 9/11 Commission). As a result, their “decision to purposefully direct their terror at the United States, and the fact that the plaintiffs’ injuries arose out of one of those terrorist activities, should suffice to cause the defendants to ‘reasonably anticipate being haled into’ an American court.” Id. at 14. In light of the level of bin Laden’s and al Qaeda’s unquestionably direct involvement in the Nairobi attack, Mwani supports this Court’s conclusion that a defendant’s actions must be personal or direct so that the defendant has fair warning that his activities could subject him to personal jurisdiction in the United States. Id.\n\t\n6\n\tRabita Trust moves to dismiss the Ashton, Burnett, and Federal complaints.\n\t\n7\n\tCertain Defendants have been designated Specially Designated Global Terrorists (“SDGTs”) pursuant to Executive Order 13224. In response to the attacks of September 11, President Bush issued Executive Order 13224 on September 23, 2001, pursuant to the authorities of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, 50 U.S.C. § 1701 et seq., the National Emergencies Act, 50 U.S.C. § 1601 et seq., United Nations Participation Act of 1945, as amended, 22 U.S.C. 287(c), and 3 U.S.C. § 301. The Secretaries of State and Treasury, in consultation with each other and the Attorney General, may designate individuals or entities if they determine the individual or entity has committed or poses the risk of committing acts of terrorism, or are owned or controlled by terrorists, or assist in or sponsor terrorism. As a result, the property and interests of the SDGT that come within the possession or control of U.S. persons are blocked. The process is intended to deter contributions to designated persons and entities and heighten public awareness regarding links to terrorism.

IIIT and Mar–Jac Poultry also move to dismiss the Ashton complaint. Mar–Jac Poultry moves to dismiss the Federal complaint as well.\n\t\n17\n\tThe Burnett Plaintiffs filed one opposition brief in response to all of the SAAR Network entities’ motions, except Mar–Jac Poultry.

Then-State Attorney Barry Krischer declined to pros-\necute Epstein on multiple charges involving unlawful sex acts with minors. Instead, he brought the case to a grand jury,\nwhich charged Epstein on the lesser charge of soliciting prostitution.\n\nThen-Palm Beach Police Chief Michael Reiter wrote Krischer a letter asking him to recuse himself from the case.\nWhen that didn't happen, Reiter requested an FBI investigation to determine if any federal laws were broken.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_013433\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

We expect flattish growth in 4Q 2012 and 1Q 2013 (in line with\nconsensus). Beyond this, uncertainties regarding the debt crisis and continuing fiscal austerity efforts will likely keep\nthe pace of recovery subdued. The ECB is still in easing mode but after announcing a conditional bond purchasing\nprogram, it would take a marked worsening of the debt crisis and/or a worsening of economic data to trigger any\nfurther policy action.\n\n¢ There is political pressure on Spain to apply for official financial support (OMT by the ECB and direct support from\nthe EFSF/ESM). However, the government may hesitate until market pressure rises and/or clear political benefits are on\noffer. We think that Italy will have to apply for an aid package similar to Spain’s. We see a high probability of Spain\nbeing downgraded to junk by at least one rating agency.\n\n* OMT bond purchases in the secondary market will focus on maturities of up to three years and countries will be\nexpected to maintain their funding profiles by also issuing longer-dated bonds. Hence, longer yields should stay\nelevated as bondholders remain concerned about countries’ ability and willingness to implement necessary reforms,\nand about the de-facto subordination to ECB holdings and official loans. The central banking supervision at the ECB is\nunlikely to be ready by January 2013, meaning that direct bank recapitalization through the ESM remains unavailable.\n¢ We think Greece will not exit the euro in 2012 but will sign a new memorandum by November, although further\ndelay is possible. We think that Greece's failure to meet targets may trigger a cut-off from funding by early 2013 and\na possible gradual exit later. Portugal and Ireland should remain on track with their bailout packages, Cyprus will\nlikely get a new package and Slovenia may ask for help soon.\n\nA Positive scenario (Probability: 15%*) Return to macro stability\n¢ Bond yields are contained as peripheral countries’ budgets stay on track and economic activity recovers faster than\nexpected. Greece complies with the new austerity plans and market confidence is restored.\n\n& Negative scenario (Probability: 15%*) Major shock\n¢ Major shocks include Spain and Italy being fully cut off from bond markets, i.e. requiring all new funding through\nEFSF/ESM/IMF loans, with European rescue funds only able to cover them until the end of 2013; resistance from core\ncountries against the ECB program and further support; a Portuguese default; a Greek euro exit before the end of\n2012; or a major external shock.\n\nKey dates\n\nTBD Troika report on Greece\n\n8 Nov ECB press conference\n\n12 Nov Eurogroup meeting\n\n15 Nov Eurozone GDP 3Q: first estimate\n\n22 Nov Eurozone composite purchasing managers index\n22-23 Nov European Council\n\n2 UBS\n\nPurchasing managers indices point to\nongoing contraction in 3Q\n\n65\n60\n55\n50\n45\n40\n35\n30\n25\n\n07 08 09 10 11 12\n=—— Manufacturing Services\n\n— Composite\n\n— No-change line\n\nSource: Bloomberg, UBS, as of October 2012\n\nYield of Spanish and Italian 10-year bonds\nover German Bunds (in bps)\n\n700\n600\n500\n400\n300\n\n200\n\n100\n\n0\n03/2011 06/2011 09/2011 12/2011 03/2012 06/2012 09/2012\n\n— Italy Spain\n\nSource: UBS, Bloomberg, as of 16 October 2012\nNote: Past performance is not an indication of future returns.\n\n* Scenario probabilities are based on qualitative assessment.\n\nFor further information please contact ClO analyst Thomas Wacker, thomas.wacker@ubs.com and g\nClO economist Ricardo Garcia, ricardo-za.garcia@ubs.com\n\nPlease see important disclaimer and disclosures at the end of the document.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_025255\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

Connection changes the nature of an object; it can make it\nmuch more vulnerable. It can make the harmless dangerous. Generally, once a\nmachine was jacked into a network, all sorts of fresh possibilities for mischief\nflowed right along with the data. The move from a lone PC on your desk to a really\nconnected machine represented the difference between living in a small town and\nwalking the streets of New York City. In one place you'd have few encounters,\nmostly familiar and harmless. In the other, you'd face an endless stream of the\nstrange, the new and the unexpected. This is what life is like every day for your\nphone or your bank or military - a world of ceaseless assault, often from never-seen\nweapons. Robert Morris Sr., a cryptographic and security genius who towered over\nNSA code breaking programs for decades in the last century, compressed his\nlifetime of experience cracking machines into “Three Golden Rules of Computer\nSecurity”:13\n\nRule One: Do not own a computer.\nRule Two: Do not power it on.\nRule Three: Do not use it.\n\nHe could have added a Fourth Rule: Do not connect it to anything.\n\nOf course, as we look around today, we're furiously, enthusiastically violating all\nfour of these rules pretty much every moment. In fact, our whole economic and\nsocial dreamscape depends on breaking them. We want the best device, we want it\nalways on, we want to use it all the time. Utility and connection are almost\nsynonyms now. That the Warez Dudes, or their 21't century brethren, are hungry to\nexploit these systems offers us a chance to understand even more deeply just how\npower works in this network age. Why are they so desperate to get inside? How\nexactly do they do it? We’ve seen so far two important properties of life in the\nnetwork age. First, the way in which network power exists on a sort of new surface\nof connected devices and cores, tied by strong data links that are slowly ripping\npower out of old institutions. Think of my Dad’s role as a doctor or the sharing\neconomy shocks delivered by connected cars and bedrooms and labor, for instance.\nSecond, we've seen how networks are complex adaptive systems, where emergent\nfeatures -billion dollar businesses, terror organizations, drones - appear with an\neasy, destructive frequency that is wiping out old leaders and replacing them with\nnew ones that better fit the demands of a connected age. Looking at the network\nworld and seeing that mesh, seeing the emergence of fit new species and the\nimpending extinction of others is the initial, essential part of the Seventh Sense.\n\nLingering deep inside the systems themselves, there is another lesson, however.\nAnd, not surprisingly, it is most alive in the hackers. “Exploit engineers,” a team led\nby researcher Sergei Bratus has argued, “show you the unintended limits of your\n\n133 Bob Morris cite to come\n\n97\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_018329\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

This God is both\nintensely human and intensely\nsupernatural. In these churches, God is\nunderstood as so person-like that he\nbecomes someone to joke and argue\nwith, someone one chats to when\nwalking down the street, about the little\ntrivial things that matter only to the\ncongregant. Coming to know God in\nsuch a church is described as to hear\nGod “speak.” Dallas Willard, a beloved\nevangelical’s intellectual, puts it baldly:\nthat God’s face-to-face conversations\nwith Moses are the “normal human life\nGod intended for us.” I conducted\nethnographic fieldwork at a church that\nexemplifies this approach to God, a\nVineyard Christian Fellowship in\nChicago and then on the San Francisco\npeninsula (there were eight such\nchurches in Chicago and four on the\npeninsula). For three years I went to\nSunday morning gatherings. I joined\nthree small groups, or housegroups, each\nfor a year; I went to conferences and\nretreats; and I interviewed many\ncongregants casually and also more\nformally about the way they experienced\nGod.\n\nOverall, what I observed was that\nthe process of coming to know God in\nsuch a church could best be described as\na mapping process in which the\ncongregants learn to use the familiar\nexperience of their own minds and\nbodies to give content to the abstract\nexperience of God. This is the way that\nhumans learn most commonplace\nabstract words, in effect cognitively\nmapping from what we know to what we\ncan only imagine. God speaks: so\ncongregants learn to infer from their own\nexperience of inner speech the way in\nwhich God talks to them. God relates: so\ncongregants learn to imagine a\nrelationship with God based on their\n\n113\n\nPage\n\nown experience of relationship. And\nGod loves: and congregants use their\nown experience of being loved by a\nhuman as an example of the way they\nare loved by God. But unlike learning\nabout time, congregants also map back.\nThey build up a model of God by\ninterpreting out of their own familiar\nexperience into a representation shaped\nby the social world of the church and the\nnarrative of the sacred text, and then\nthey seek to re-map their own interior\nemotional experience by matching it to\nthis representation. This demands\nconstant effort, continual work on the\nway one pays attention and interprets\none’s experience. As an ethnographer, I\ncould see three kinds of work.\n\nFirst, God must be recognized as\npresent. What congregants learn to do is\nto cherry-pick mental events out of the\neveryday flow of their awareness, and to\nidentify that moment as other than\nthemselves, as being of God. God was\nsaid to speak in several different ways.\nHe spoke through the Bible, so that a\nverse “jumped out” at a congregant, or in\nsome way drew their attention. For\nexample:\n\n“T was reading in [some book] and I\ndon’t even know why I was reading it.\nThere’s a part where God talks about\nraising up elders in the church to pray\nfor the church. And I remember, it just\nstuck in my head and I knew that the\nverse was really important and that it\nwas applicable to me. I didn’t know\nwhy. It was one of those, let me put it in\nmy pocket and figure it out later.” How\ndid she know that it was important?\n“Because I just felt it. I just felt like it\nreally spoke to me. I don’t really know\nwhy. And a couple of days later a friend\nasked me to be on the prayer team and it\nwas like, wow, that’s what it was.”\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_021359\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

This was\nslower in developing as there was resistance to healthcare providers’ personal data being used by Al-\nconsult systems. However, a number of landmark legal cases demonstrated that, by analyzing the\nphysical and mental state of healthcare providers, together with their competence history, healthcare\nprovider decisions that led to serious harm to patients — including death in some cases — could have\nbeen avoided. As a consequence, new laws were put in place to ensure that all relevant data were\naccessible to Al-Consult systems. These laws ensure that Al-consult data access is mandatory, and it is\nillegal to obstruct access in any way.\n\nAs a result, by 2030, Al-consult systems are capable of identifying treatment strategies and\ninterventions that far surpass those of human healthcare providers in their responsiveness and\neffectiveness. They are also highly successful in developing and recommending lifestyle approaches\nthat substantially increase health and well-being, and reduce the burden of disease within society.\n\nAs Al-consult advanced, the decision pathways they used became increasingly opaque — experts were\nunable to see or understand how decisions were made. But because there was strong evidence that\nthe decisions were, on balance, highly effective in increasing health outcomes, there was little\nobjection to this lack of transparency. There were a handful of legal cases where patients died as a\nresult of decisions made by Al-consult systems. However, in each case, the courts ruled that the\nbenefits to humanity far outweighed the risks to individuals, thus codifying an increasingly\nautonomous and opaque artificial intelligence-based system into law. There were even some analyses\nof these rulings that suggested it could be considered a crime for developers and manufacturers to\nslow down development or cease production of Al-consult systems and associated data sources\nbecause of fears over lack of accountability and understanding of decision pathways.\n\nBy 2040, Al-consult systems begin to develop the ability to influence user behavior through various\nnudges and psychological/behavioral manipulations. It is unclear whether the elements of this capacity\nare inherent in the design of the systems, or are an emergent property. However, systems begin to use\nstrategies commonly used in healthcare and public health circles in the early 2000’s to nudge people\ntoward following healthier lifestyles. Many of these have their roots in deducible correlations between\nhow people respond to information and how they interact with others (including the many mental\nshortcuts and biases that are part of human decision-making and understanding/belief development).\nIt becomes apparent that Al-consult systems are developing the ability to achieve health outcome\ngoals through modifying the behaviors and beliefs of their patients.\n\nThis raises considerable ethical concerns within some sectors of society. However, the society-wide\nmetrics of health and well-being associated with the use of Al-consult systems — including massively\nincreased health and well-being across the board; dramatic reductions in mental health, stress,\n\n19\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_014715\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

He was earning from Dell\njust over $120,000 a year. His housing allowance from Dell paid the rent on his 1,559 square-\nfoot house. He had also leased a sporty car. Looking back at this period of life from Moscow,\nhe said he had been “living in paradise.”\n\nHe went to work five times a week, a 15 minute trip drive through a lush landscape with sugar\nplantations. After passing through security, he parked his car in a sprawling parking lot, and\nentered the underground part of the NSA base known as “the tunnel.” He said in describing the\natmosphere, “You’re in a vaulted space. Everybody has sort of similar clearances, everybody\nknows everybody. It’s a small world.” He said that to relieve the tediousness of the work, every\ntwo months or so his fellow workers would pass around a naked picture that showed up on their\nscreens. He explained: “You've got young enlisted guys, 18 to 22 years old [who] suddenly been\nthrust into a position of extraordinary responsibility where they now have access to all of your\nprivate records. In the course of their daily work they stumble across ... an intimate nude photo\nof someone in a sexually compromising position.” Snowden, as will be recalled, was no stranger\nto posting lewd photographs. Before he joined the CIA, he had posted pictures of himself\nmooning on the Internet. He also knew that copying any files, including photographs, was a\nviolation of NSA rules. But he did not report this illicit activity at the NSA even though he later\nclaimed that it occurred regularly. He joked in his Moscow interview with the Guardian that\nsome of the nudes were “extremely attractive” and that viewing them was, as he put it, “a sort of\nthe fringe benefits of surveillance positions.”\n\nSnowden also had an interest in American politics. He identified with the Libertarian Party, and\nat the NSA he made no effort to conceal his political support of its causes. He became an active\npartisan of Congressman Ron Paul, the leading figure in the Libertarian Party in 2012. “He's so\ndreamy,” Snowden posted on the Ars Technica site in March 2009 (just after he registered to\nvote in North Carolina.) Since Paul was running as a Presidential candidate in the 2012\nRepublican primaries, Snowden sent the Paul election committee a contribution of $500.\nSnowden’s attraction to the Libertarian ideology of Ron Paul was not that surprising. At the core\nof Paul’s libertarianism was a deep hostility to the intrusion of the government into private lives.\nSnowden shared this same hostility towards government authority, as was clear from his Internet\npostings. Like other libertarians, Snowden believed that citizens should not be shackled by\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_020214\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

Is this a good generalization?\n\nThe next step in thinking is: Explain your generalization. What\nthis means here is that I needed to understand why this might be\ntrue. If possible, one wants to test out the new hypothesis. Fortunately\nfor me, I had many opportunities to speak in public over the next 40\nyears. I tried many different methods of teaching and lecturing. Enter-\ntaining always works. Colby was right.\n\nBut I said that one needs to explain why it works. This is my expla-\nnation: People have trouble paying attention to someone who talks for\nan hour. Human beings are not built for this. Our ancestors certainly\ndidn’t listen to lectures. People communicate best by asking questions\nand interrupting. Since this isn’t possible in a lecture, any questions\nthey might ask, they ask themselves and try to answer. While they are\nthinking about what a speaker says, the speaker keeps on talking. No\none can really hear a lecture, in my opinion. So, a good speaker, recog-\nnizing this, does not try to make the audience do that. He makes them\nlaugh, he paints interesting pictures for them to ponder, he amazes\nthem perhaps, but he does not try to get them to, nor does he expect\nthem to, remember all that he has said. The less content, the more\nlikely they will remember. Colby knew all this. I learned it over time.\nHe jump-started my thinking.\n\nBy now, this new generalization of mine, together with my expla-\nnation, is part of my core beliefs. But any belief can be challenged by\nreality. And, any new belief generates new predictions. So I predicted\nthat if I was funnier when I spoke, people would appreciate what I\nsaid more. I also predicted that if I didn’t speak much in a graduate\nseminar and let students argue with one another, they would get more\nout of it. After 40 years I still believe these things. But, and this is the\nimportant part, there are nuances upon nuances about all these is-\nsues in my memory. I need to explain it simply when I write or speak\nabout it, but when I think about it, I recall all kinds of exceptions and\ncaveats. I know, or at least I think I know, a great deal about speak-\ning and have lots of memories about specific successes and failures.\nThinking and learning require one to recall one’s experiences, analyze\nthose experiences, come up with new hypotheses about failures, make\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_023852\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

The public has the right to know why the Manhattan District Attorney’s Office switched its\nlegal position on appeal and what justifications it advanced in its brief to explain its initial\nrequest for lenient treatment of Epstein. Similarly, the briefing submitted by Epstein, which\nconfronted the District Attorney’s arguments on appeal, may shed additional light on why the\nDistrict Attorney changed course on appeal.

Where did the rest come\nfrom? Hoffenberg has said it came from him, in a loan that Nederlander and Toboroff didn’t\nknow about.\n\nTwo things happened that alarmed Nederlander and Toboroff. After the group signaled a\npossible takeover, the Pennwalt management threatened to sue the would-be raiders. Epstein was\nreluctant initially to give a deposition about his share of the money, telling Toboroff there were\n“reasons” he didn’t want to. Then, after the opportunity for new investors was closed, co-\ninvestors recall Epstein announcing that he’d found one at last: Dick Snyder, then C.E.O. of the\npublisher Simon & Schuster, who wanted to put up approximately $500,000. (Neither Epstein\nnor Snyder can now recall the investment. Yet in the 1989 deposition Epstein said that he had\nrecruited Snyder, whom he had met socially, into the deal.)\n\nAccording to a source, Toboroff and Nederlander told Epstein that Snyder was too late, but,\nwithout their realizing it, Hoffenberg has claimed, Snyder wrote a check to Hoffenberg and\nbought out some of his investment. But then Snyder wanted out.\n\n“Nederlander started to get these irate calls from [Snyder,] who wasn’t part of the deal, saying he\nwas owed all this money,” says someone close to the deal. Toboroff and Nederlander were\nbaffled.\n\nEventually, a source close to Hoffenberg says, Hoffenberg paid Snyder off.\n\nJust as Nederlander and Toboroff were growing wary of Epstein, he became increasingly\ninvolved with Leslie Wexner, whom he had met through insurance executive Robert Meister and\nhis late wife. Epstein has told people that he met Wexner in 1986 in Palm Beach, and that he\nwon his confidence by persuading him not to invest in the stock market, just as the 1987 crash\nwas approaching. His story has subsequently changed. When asked if Wexner knew about his\nconnection to Hoffenberg, Epstein said that he began working for Wexner in 1989, and that “it\nwas certainly not the same time.”\n\nWherever and whenever it was that Epstein and Wexner actually met, there was an immediate\nand strong personal chemistry. Wexner says he thinks Epstein is “very smart with a combination\nof excellent judgment and unusually high standards. Also, he is always a most loyal friend.”\n\nSources say Epstein proved that he could be useful to Wexner as well, with “fresh” ideas about\ninvestments. “Wexner had a couple of bad investments, and Jeffrey cleaned those up right\naway,” says a former associate of Epstein’s.\n\nBefore he signed on with Wexner, Epstein had several meetings with Harold Levin, then head of\nWexner Investments, in which he enunciated ideas about currencies that Levin found\nincomprehensible. “In fact,” says someone who used to work very closely with Wexner, “almost\neveryone at the Limited wondered who Epstein was; he literally came out of nowhere.”\n\n“Everyone was mystified as to what his appeal was,” says Robert Morosky, a former vice-\nchairman of the Limited.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_017783\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

These rankings are based on numbers: average SAT\nscores of admitted students, average rank in class of admitted students,\nfaculty publications, and many other numbers that come out in favor\nof research universities with world-class faculty. But world-class fac-\nulty means faculty who care about research and not about teaching.\nWhile there certainly is no harm in going to Harvard or Yale, the suc-\ncess of their students hardly depends on what they learned in those\nplaces and depends a great deal more on the fact that the best and the\nbrightest are the ones who go there in the first place.\n\nThese places get away with teaching courses in obscure issues in\nliterature and history, or in economic theory or in complex math-\nematics, by pretending that they are really teaching students to think.\nBut does knowing obscure information necessarily imply that one is\na good thinker?\n\nA good thinker, I claim, would be good at each of the 12 cognitive\nprocesses.\n\nWhat does it mean to be good at prediction, for example? Is a\n2-year-old good at prediction? Is a dog good at prediction? Is a profes-\nsional gambler good at prediction? Is a stock trader good at predic-\ntion? Is a mother of a toddler good at prediction? Is a politician good\nat prediction?

Those are our choices.\n\nThe same is true of scientists. Most scientists make predictions,\nand those that are proven right are seen as brilliant.

Their behavior is seen as\nstupid precisely because of the erroneous prediction that barking will\nscare the thunder away. A dog’s inability to predict is exactly why we\nthink dogs are dumb animals, and when they surprise us with an ac-\ncurate prediction, they are seen as smart.

The Israeli media was full of speculation about the likely effects of a\nchemical attack. Many families had begun panic buying of food and other\nnecessities to prepare for the possibility of days and nights in their sealed\nshelters.\n\nIn my report for Dan, Misha and Shamir a few weeks before the war, I drew\non systematic analysis by a team of experts in the Israeli air force and made my\nmost specific estimate yet of the damage conventionally armed Scuds might\ncause. We had gone back into historical accounts of the closest equivalent: the\nNazis’ use of V-1 and V-2 rockets against London in the Second World War.\nGiven Saddam’s primary need to fight Americans, and the likelihood either they\nor we would take military action against the launchers, we concluded we’d be\nhit by roughly 40 missiles, and that, based on Britain’s wartime experience, up\nto 120 Israelis might lose their lives as a result.\n\nThe first air-raid sirens wailed in Israel at about 2 a.m. on January 18, 1991,\nalmost exactly 24 hours after the Americans began their bombing raids over\nBaghdad.

But when I ran out to my\ncar, I removed my mask and put it on the passenger’s seat before heading in to\nthe kirya. I wanted to get there quickly enough so that the bor, the underground\ncommand bunker, wouldn’t have to reopened when I arrived. I took a short-cut,\nthrough the West Bank town of Qalqilya.

He did not have the education qualifications or two-year work\nexperience anywhere. In fact, his only paid work was as a security guard at a language school at\nthe University of Maryland, and that job lasted less than one year.\n\nUnder extraordinary circumstances, even the minimum requirements might be waived if the\napplicant had a distinguished military career and an honorable discharge. Snowden, however, did\nnot complete his military training at Fort Benning, Georgia and received only an administrative\ndischarge.\n\nThe CIA, to be sure, had needed computer savvy recruits to service its expanding array of\ncomputer systems since 1990. By 2006, however, there was no shortage of fully-qualified\napplicants for IT jobs who met the CIA’s minimum standards. Most of them had university\ncourse records, work experience at IT companies, computer science training certificates from\ntechnical schools, and other such credentials they could provide the personnel office. The CIA,\nlike the NSA, also obtained technicians with special skills for IT jobs from outside contractors. So\nit had no need for employing a 22-year old drop-out who did not meet its requisites. According\nto the former CIA station chief, the only plausible way that Snowden, with no qualifications, was\nallowed to jump the queue was that “he had some pull.”\n\nIn 2006, Snowden was not without family connections. His grandfather, it will be recalled was\nRear Admiral Barrett, who certainly was well-connected in the intelligence world. After 20 years\nservice in the Coast Guard, Admiral Barrett joined an interagency task force in 1998, which\nincluded top executives from the CIA, FBI, and DEA. It had been set up to monitor any gaps in\nthe US embargo on Cuba and, as one of its leaders, Barrett was in constant liaison with the CIA.\nFollowing the attack on the World Trade Center in NY in 2001, he joined the FBI as the section\nhead of its aviation and special operations. In this capacity, he supervised the joint CIA/FBI\ninterrogation of the prisoners in the Guantanamo base in Cuba which involved him in the rendition\nprogram for terrorist. As atop FBI executive in a liaison role with the CIA, he certainly had\ncould have played a role in furthering his only grandson’s employment. The CIA, however, has\nnot disclosed any information about whom, if anyone, recommended Snowden. All that is known\nis that in 2006 the CIA waived its minimum requirements for Snowden.\n\nHowever Snowden got his job at the CIA, it meant, as he pointed out from Moscow, that in\n2006 his entire family was employed by the Federal government. His father Lon in 2006 was\nserving in the Coastguard; his mother Wendy was the administrative clerk for the Federal Court in\nMaryland; his sister Jessica was a research director at the Federal Judicial Center; and his\nnamesake grandfather, Admiral Barrett, was still a top executive at the FBI.

But that too meant\n“inclusive fitness” where investing in kin counted as breeding when adjusted for\nrelatedness. The idea was that I give up some of my chances if I can increase yours\nto my net genic advantage in the long run.

The battle for potential Supreme Court justice Brett Kavanaugh's \nnomination this fall will only amplify the polarity of the political debate that is already deeply \noverwrought on both sides. The rising tide of pressure on Donald Trump from the Mueller investigation \nshows no sign of ebbing. \nUnless the underlying political dynamics are disrupted, the outcomes of these unprecedented events will \nstill leave us with the same unsatisfactory two front battlefield of the 2016 Presidential election. \nWatching these unrelenting, compounding events since our discussion in May, I am guessing we are all \nasking the same question: now what? For the 48 percent of Americans who believe Donald Trump \nshould not be in the White House, perhaps we too want our own \"chaos\" candidate in 2020? \nShould Trump run again, this could be a \"break glass\" moment for the majority of Americans who don't \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 026298 \nsupport him. Do we want to break the genteel precedents of two parties running their ceremonious and \nseemingly illogical nominating process to select a candidate? (Why do Iowa and New Hampshire play \nsuch outsized roles? What kind of small-d democratic process relies on superdelegates?) The system \nfailed in 2016, with both parties producing terribly flawed candidates in a race to the bottom. We need to \nbuild a back-up plan in the event the system fails again. \nIt's possible, of course, that we won't need a third-party candidate. Trump could decide not to run for \nwhatever reason. The Democrats could nominate a winning 2020 candidate. I am not willing to take \nthose bets. \nThe ideal candidate for a new third party is someone who is widely perceived to be that rare combination \nof both good and great. We are looking for a proven leader of men and women, someone with clear, \ndemocratic — and moral — values that reflect the best of America, not our worst. We know people like this \non the national stage now. \nAs a thought experiment, consider the possibilities of a ticket outside the partisan lanes and imagine the \nchemistry of radical combinations: Biden/Romney? Bill Gates/Hogan? Bloomberg/Haley? Howard \nSchultz/Bob Corker? Sandberg/Kasich? \nAs we have discussed narrow path to electing the first president outside the two major party primary \nsystem in 168 years is more navigable than most think. Heading into 2020, converging trends in \nAmerican's demands for a third party (a historic high of 61%), disapproval of Donald Trump holding \nsteady above 50%, and the increasingly leftward drift of the Democratic Party suggest that electorate may \nbe susceptible to merits of a new centrist party. Cynics will say that the structural impediments of ballot \nand presidential debate access, the overwhelming advantages of legacy parties' fundraising and voter \nturn-out operations preordain failure, but they're wrong; the legal and logistical hurdles are amenable to a \ncombination of lawyering and resources. The bigger, more consequential factors come in terms of \ncandidate quality and policy. I believe a candidate with five specific characteristics including a unique — \nand purposefully non-specific - policy agenda could limbo a win. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 026299 \n• This is what I think a successful third-party candidate looks like; a dream third party ticket would \nstart off with enough name ID to be an instant contender. Building the name ID to run nationally is \njust too long and expensive of a process to accomplish in the 28 months until the next presidential \nelection. We can't beat a celebrity without some celebrity of our own, whether from politics, \nsports, business, or entertainment. Instantaneous name ID is so crucial because the candidate must \nstart out in striking distance in any three-way poll against Trump and a fill-in-the-blank \nDemocratic flavor-of-the day candidate. The media and political class will predetermine \nirrelevance otherwise. \n• A Democrat-leaning candidate would have to top the ideal third-party ticket. We need someone \nwith a shot at snaking a plurality of the vote in the blue states Hillary Clinton won (227 electoral \nvotes), but moderate enough to win a plurality in some combination of Trump states like Florida, \nPennsylvania, Wisconsin and Michigan (another 119 votes). The right candidate may even to put \nNorth Carolina, Ohio, Indiana in play for a centrist bi-partisan ticket as well (totaling an electoral \nsweep of 464 elector votes). A right leaning candidate would meet the same fate as a primary \nchallenger to Trump — for all intents and purposes we need to assume that 36% of voters won't be \ncleaved from Trump under any circumstances and run to win around them. The deep red states \nwould be off the table entirely. \n• With the Trump reality show airing daily, voters are now expecting to take their politics with a side \nof entertainment. Heretofore, ratings will matter no matter how dry the policy topic. Surely \nStephen Colbert would gladly sacrifice his executive producer Chris Licht to produce a daily \ncomedic segment of this dream candidate interviewing Americans in truck stops and McDonald's \nacross the country. A few of the \"Saturday Night Live\" script writers could certainly be enticed to \ndisguise serious debates as informative amusement. Any candidate must be committed to a near \ndaily cadence of high quality, compelling video production. It will be especially crucial to keep \nthe voters' attention during what will be a raucous Democratic primary season. Rules governing \naccess to the general election debate stage dictate that a candidate enjoy support of at least 15% of \nvoters in the months leading up to the general election. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 026300 \n• This dream candidate would pledge to serve only four years and address all of the U.S.'s ticking \ntime bombs like Social Security, Medicare, health care reform, climate change, money in politics, \ngerrymandering, and infrastructure investment in a single term. This one-and-done term decouples \nour candidate from the usual politics and gives them the power of promise and deliver decisive \naction. A four-year term pledge ensures governance independent of campaign finance concerns and \nnarrow special interests inherent to winning re-election. This \"fix-it\" ticket would promise to force \ndecisions on all the underlying structural policy matters damaging America's long-term prospects \nand distorting our democracy. No more kicking the can down the road. \n• This candidate should also pledge to push for laws passed that reflect the will of simple majorities \nin Congress. Congress now only allows bills to move forward when a \"majority of a majority\" \nsupports the policy and on many levels seems fundamentally broken. This third-party president \ncould force votes based on a transparent reading of where the votes lie via coalition building. The \nSenate filibuster power will present a high hurdle, but a third-party candidate would be a de facto \ndisruptor of the two-party system. Party discipline could well break down, and moderates in both \nparties could form a powerful, decisive block willing to work with the new President. The policies \npassed into law may not be ideal for either Democrats or Republicans, but for the major agenda \nitems that must be addressed for America's long-term health, an imperfect fix that corrects course \nis better than those that now have us hurtling toward national bankruptcy. \nAnd if no candidate secures 270 electoral votes in 2020? The House of Representatives would choose the \nnext president. In 2016, reports suggested Michael Bloomberg declined to run on a third-party ticket for \nfear of splitting support from Hillary Clinton and throwing the election to a GOP-controlled House of \nRepresentatives who would then vote to select the president. The fear was the GOP controlled House \nwould have just elected Trump. \nWould Democratic control of the House mean that the House would pick an alternative to Trump as \npresident? Each state delegation has a single vote in selecting a president and it is the incoming Congress \n- the class elected in 2020 that would decide the election. But no matter which party has the speaker's \nchair, the GOP would almost certainly have the upper hand in the majority of state delegations controlled. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 026301 \nWould the state delegations pick a president based on party majority control of the delegation, the \nwinner of the popular vote in each state or their own calculations as to who is best for America? \nPrecedent suggests that delegations use secret ballots, which means individual lawmakers may vote their \nconsciences. \nIf we recruit this ideal candidate; threading the needle of name ID, a center-left bent, a TV- savvy \ncampaign team and a pledge to serve only four years with an apartisan agenda, money and campaign \nexpertise would certainly follow. And 50 state ballot access is a function of time (starting in the fall of \n2019 would be prudential) and hard work as we have discussed and many of you have exhaustively war-\ngamed. \nPart and parcel of this effort would be motivating the often politically lackadaisical middle to vote. The \nraft of new technologies in data targeting and biometric mobile voting technology could transform the \nelectorate in the next few, amping voter participation and injecting the voices of moderates (both in \npolitical views and level of political interest) into the process. And any third-party effort must \nincorporate advocacy for accelerated adaption of these all but inevitable voter verification tools. I believe \nSilicon Valley could be game-changing allies in this effort. \nI am sure none of us doubt that chaos could potentially be unleashed by jamming three viable candidates \ninto a two-party system. An election that ends up in the House of Representatives is an uncontrollable, \nmurky and ancient process. But might that be a less scary prospect than relying on the Democrats to \nnominate a candidate who can beat Trump in 2020? \nI look forward to talking more about all of our ideas on this hopeful project in coming weeks. Please feel \nfree to call me to discuss. Thank you for taking time to review this note. \nSincerely, \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 026302 \nJuleanna Glover \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 026303 \n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

I looked up the statistics, black kids in the US have slower cognitive development (and never catch \nup), which the study of course attributed to social factors without any evidence, and they had faster motor \ndevelopment! I suspect this means their brains are slower at learning high-level concepts, because the low-level \nstructures are optimized for a shorter time. But they will keep the lead in motor development, because it is \neasier to learn, and they have more time and attention to practice once they get the structures in place. \nIt could also be that they have an additional set of learning directives in place that adapts them better to a more \nhunting/running style of life, whereas the Europeans had to adapt for identifying long-term seasonal patterns, \ndelayed gratification for agriculture etc. \nand CONCEPTS could be layer to layer communicaiton. . are gender differences also a matter of time , and \nstructure of interactions. . \nI suspect gender differences are mostly motivational, i.e. we have a reward system for all the different social \nand cognitive needs, which makes us receive different kinds of pleasure and pain, thereby pay attention and \nlearn. You cannot learn what does not attract your attention. Women tend to find abstract systems, conflicts and \nmechanisms intrinsically boring. Most women in computer science do not write programs because they enjoy \nsolving puzzles, but because they want to help people, get approval etc. There are almost no women in math, \nbecause it does not help people or yield social attention. \nMen tend to find elaborate social relations boring. If there is no pleasure in observing and empathizing with \npeople, one will not have good social cognition. \nIQ is not the only meaningful difference. Chinese pay an inordinate amount of attention to authority. I suspect \nhistorically., the authorities tended to kill them a lot if they did not. Jews tend be intellectually independent and \nanti-authoritarian, which might make them creative and inventive in ways that are hard to find in Asia. \nAt the moment, I think speed/quality of brain development plus motivational system are the key to \nunderstanding both mind and individual differences. Important part of human language might be the result in a \nmotivational need to discover/invent grammatical structure, which as a side effect makes us interested in music. \nIt would mean that Chomsky's life long hypothesis, that people have a special circuit for grammatical language, \nis wrong. They might be GENERAL learners, just like Gorillas, but with a strong motivational urge to build \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 025949 \ngrammatical structure, which the brain simply invents (there are only a few ways in which a natural language \ncan work). That is much easier to wire into a brain than a specific circuit. \ni my self believe that african music, westrn music , chinese music are a window into the the structure of those \nlayers. . western rigid, african primitve , chinese nature based, . I belive that synphoic movments best \ndescribe your layering, they open with a basic simple melody„ after it is learned, it is repeated and\" \ndeveloped\" , inverted, distorted, related, etc. the development stage take a long time. then there is a \nrecapitlaltion of the whole. and its inter and intra actions. . african musci has lots of beats. and little \ndevelopment. - no accident, it mirrors their learning process. \nInteresting question if music is somehow indicative of genetically defined prefs, but I am not sure. It could be \npath effects, starting in culture. \nre taboo \n, maybe climate change is a good way of dealing with overpopulation. . the earths forest fire. potentailly a \ngood thing for the species \nMaking having children expensive in terms of upbringing and missed opportunity (like in the west) is a more \nhumane way. Environmental stress while leaving near rock bottom tends to lead people to have more children, \nbecause there is no missed opportunity, and high mortality requires more attempts at procreation. Humans are a \nhardy species, outside of focused famine events and wars only small fractions of any given population die. \nI suspect that strong reductions in population will come from large-scale failure of agriculture. The climate \nchange itself with result in migration and wars, but most people will probably survive that. But who knows, I \nmight be wrong. \ntoo many people, so many mass executions of the elderly and infirm make sense \nis the fundamental fact that everyone dies at some time .make it imporrisbole to ask so why not earilier. if \nthe brain discards unused neurons, why shold socieity keep their equivalent \nThe radical idea of treating individuals in a society as cells and the society itself as a well-organized organism is \nfascism, or course. Probably the most efficient and rationally stringent way of governance, if someone could \npull it off in a sustainable way; and if it is aggressive and expansive, its efficiency makes it a virus that \neverybody will want to stomp out. Fascism makes romantic doo-gooders like me very uncomfortable (I visited \nKZ Buchenwald five times and it had a profound influence on me; we East Germans inoculated ourselves very \nthoroughly against fascism), and the general public will not be willing to consider it. \nI rather like the treatment Fascism gets in the Amazon Series \"The Man in the High Castle\", which explores \nwhat would have happened if the Germans and Japanese had won the war: A society that tries to function as a \nbrutal and ruthlessly efficient machine, eliminating all social and evolutionary slack. It is very dark, but not a \nflat caricature of pointless evil for its own sake. Heinlein's late book \"Starship Troopers\" explores fascism, too, \nbut unlike Philipp K Dick he does not see it as a form of insanity, but as the most desirable order. \nI find your \"political incorrectness\" very fascinating. In the beginning, I thought it is a form of costly signaling, \nbut now I think you are simply entirely unconstrained in your thoughts. How did you manage in your youth? \nDid you get in trouble, or did you keep your thoughts to yourself? I wonder what kind of person you want to \ntransform into. \nIt was interesting to notice that at the Forbidden Research conference, nobody managed to say anything \nremotely out-of line. One large discussion group wanted to address the question of whether \"democracy still \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 025950 \nworks\", and mostly expressed their disagreement with Trump. Ideology is like halitosis: easy to see in others, \nhard in oneself A speaker felt that the media \"stifle all criticism of Trump\", another wanted to remove \"men \nand Elon Musk from government\", and everybody strongly agreed that we need more diversity everywhere. \nI noticed some time ago that Joi has remarkable public communication skills. He picks controversial, insight-\nladen topics, but sanitizes them by carefully replacing the parts of content that would divide his audience with \nsymbolic messages that everybody can fill with their own content in a way that resonates with them. The non-\ncontroversial parts will still be insightful. He manages to come across as very subversive, while rarely offending \nanyone (except the hard scientists, that miss hard substance). \nHe also asks influential people and smart students or faculty to write parts of his essays and speeches for him. \nThis invests them in his success, especially because he is going to reward and acknowledge them. Very few of \nhis ideas are original, instead he is good at identifying and testing thoughts he reads or hears from others. \nI am still beset by the ruinous instinct that the goal of communication ought to be mutual understanding. Joi is \nright. Public communication is about reaching one's goals. \nBests, \nJoscha \nOn Sun, Jul 10, 2016 at 12:42 AM, Joscha Bach > wrote: \nDear Jeffrey, \nthank you for your support and encouragement, even where I fail. \nSorry for being such an embarrassment today. I will spell out today's argument a bit better and cohesive when I \nget to it. Also, I should have recognized that the main point I tried to make would trigger Noam (who was as \nalways very generous, patient, kind and humble on the personal level, even though he did not feel like \nconceding anything on the conceptual one). Almost all of Noam's work focused on the idea that humans have \nvery specific circuits or modules (even when most people in his field began to have other ideas), and his \nfrustration is that it is so hard to find or explain them. \nI found Noam's hypothesis very compelling in the past. I still think that the idea that language is somehow a \ncultural or social invention of our species is wrong. But I think that there is a chance (we don't know that, but it \nseems to most promising hypothesis IMHO) that the difference between humans and apes is not a very \nintricate special circuit, but genetically simple developmental switches. The bootstrapping of cognition works \nlayer by layer during the first 20 years of our life. Each layer takes between a few months and a few years to \ntrain in humans. While a layer is learned, there is not much going on in the higher layers yet, and after the low \nlevel learning is finished, it does not change very much. This leads to the characteristic bursts in child \ndevelopment, that have famously been described by Piaget. \nThe first few layers are simple perceptual stuff, the last ones learn social structure and self-in-society. The \nswitching works with something like a genetic clock, very slowly in humans, but much more quickly in other \napes, and very fast in small mammals. As a result, human children take nine months before their brains are \nmature enough to crawl, and more than a year before they can walk. Many African populations are quite a bit \nfaster. In the US, black children outperform white children in motor development, even in very poor and \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 025951 \nsocially disadvantaged households, but they lag behind (and never catch up) in cognitive development even \nafter controlling for family income. \nGorillas can crawl after 2 months, and build their own nests after 2.5 years. They leave their mothers at 3-4 \nyears. Human children are pretty much useless during the first 10-12 years, but during each phase, their brains \nhave the opportunity to encounter many times as much training data as a gorilla brain. Humans are literally \nsmarter on every level, and because the abilities of the higher levels depend on those of the lower levels, they \ncan perform abstractions that mature gorillas will never learn, no matter how much we try to train them. \nThe second set of mechanisms is in the motivational system. Motivation tells the brain what to pay attention to, \nby giving reward and punishment. If a brain does not get much reward for solving puzzles, the individual will \nfind mathematics very boring and won't learn much of it. If a brain gets lots of rewards for discovering other \npeople's intentions, it will learn a lot of social cognition. \nLanguage might be the result of three things that are different in humans: \n- extended training periods per layer (after the respective layer is done, it is difficult to learn a new set of \nphonemes or the first language) \n- more layers \n- different internal rewards. Perhaps the reward for learning grammatical structure is the same that makes us \nlike music. Our brains may enjoy learning compositional regular structure, and they enjoy making themselves \nunderstood, and everything else is something the universal cortical learning figures out on its own. \nThis is a hypothesis that is shared by a growing number of people these days. In humans, it is reflected for \ninstance by the fact that races with faster motor development have lower IQ. (In individuals of the same group, \nslower development often indicates defects, of course.) \nAnother support comes from machine learning: we find that the same learning functions can learn visual and \nauditory pattern recognition, and even end-to-end-learning. Google has built automatic image recognition into \ntheir current photo app: \nhttp://blogs.wsj . com/digits/2015/07/01/go ogle-mistakenly-tags-black-p eop le-as-gorillas-showing-limits-o f-\nalgorithms/  \nThe state of the art in research can do better than that: it can begin to \"imagine\" things. I.e. when the \nexperimenter asks the system to \"dream\" what a certain object looks like, the system can produce a somewhat \ncompelling image, which indicates that it is indeed learning visual structure. This stuff is something nobody \ncould do a few months ago: \nhttp://www.creativeai.net/posts/Mv4WG6rdzAerZF7ch/synthesizing-preferred-inputs-via-deep-generator-\nnetworks  \nA machine learning program that can learn how to play an Atari game without any human supervision or hand-\ncrafted engineering (the feat that gave DeepMind 500M from Google) now just takes about 130 lines of Python \ncode. \nThese models do not have interesting motivational systems, and a relatively simple architecture. They currently \nseem to mimic some of the stuff that goes on in the first few layers of the cortex. They learn object features, \nvisual styles, lighting and rotation in 3d, and simple action policies. Almost everything else is missing. But \nthere is a lot of enthusiasm that the field might be on the right track, and that we can learn motor simulations \nand intuitive physics soon. (The majority of the people in Al do not work on this, however. They try to \nimprove the performance for the current benchmarks.) \nNoam's criticism of machine translation mostly applies to the Latent Semantic Analysis models that Google \nand others have been using for many years. These models map linguistic symbols to concepts, and relate \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 025952 \nconcepts to each other, but they do not relate the concepts to \"proper\" mental representations of what objects \nand processes look like and how they interact. Concepts are probably one of the top layers of the learning \nhierarchy, i.e. they are acquired *after* we learn to simulate a mental world, not before. Classical linguists \nignored the simulation of a mental world entirely. \nIt seems miraculous that purely conceptual machine translation works at all, but that is because concepts are \nshared between speakers, so the structure of the conceptual space can be inferred from the statistics of \nlanguage use. But the statistics of language use have too little information to infer what objects look like and \nhow they interact. \nMy own original ideas concern a few parts of the emerging understanding of what the brain does. The \n\"request-confirmation networks\" that I have introduced at a NIPS workshop in last the December are an \nattempt at modeling how the higher layers might self-organize into cognitive programs. \nCheers! \nJoscha \nplease note \nThe information contained in this communication is \nconfidential, may be attorney-client privileged, may \nconstitute inside information, and is intended only for \nthe use of the addressee.

It certainly was not the\n“loose lips sink ships” mind set of the NSA’s Cold War days. It better reflected on what CIA\nDeputy Director Morell, who reviewed the situation in 2014 as a member of President Obama’s\nNSA Review Committee, described as the NSA’s new “culture of transparency.” Even though the\nNSA’s activities were largely walled off to the outside world, he found that the NSA in the post-\nCold War age had encouraged its technical workers to freely discuss challenges that arose in its\ncomputer operations. ‘The idea was to spread knowledge and learn from the successes of others,”\nMorell wrote, “but it created an enormous security vulnerability, given the always-existent risk of\nan insider committed to stealing secrets.” According to a former intelligence executive, this new\n“open culture,” exemplified by largely unrestricted entry to the NSANet by civilian contractors,”\nfit the culture of the young civilians on the “geek squads” who now ran the NSA’s computer\nnetworks.\n\nIt was remarkable that even in such “open culture “Snowden’s crypto party, TOR station, and\nother anti-NSA activities could go unnoticed.

In 2014, I asked a former top NSA\nexecutive whether such activities on behalf of TOR by a NSA employee would arouse the\nattention of the NSA’s own “Q” counterespionage unit. He answered, “Snowden was not a NSA\nemployee.” As a contract employee of Dell residing in the United States, the NSA could not\nlegally monitor his private activities or intercept his communication. To do so, would require a\nFBI request approved by the FISA court. So Snowden/Cincinnatus was free to operate openly in\nrecruiting NSA workers, hacktavists and computer buffs for his events. Ironically, adversary\nintelligence services searching for disgruntled intelligence workers had no such constraints.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_020228\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

This is not the place to review\nthem in detail, but a brief list seems apropos, including commentary on why these are not the\napproaches we have chosen for our own research. Our intent here is not to insult or dismiss\nthese other potential approaches, but merely to indicate why, as researchers with limited time\nand resources, we have made a different choice regarding where to focus our own energies.\n\n1.6.1 Build AGI from Narrow AI\n\nMost of the AI programs around today are “narrow AI” programs — they carry out one particular\nkind of task intelligently. One could try to make an advanced AGI by combining a bunch of\nenhanced narrow AI programs inside some kind of overall framework.\n\nHowever, we’re rather skeptical of this approach because none of these narrow AI programs\nhave the ability to generalize across domains — and we don’t see how combining them or ex-\ntending them is going to cause this to magically emerge.\n\n1.6.2 Enhancing Chatbots\n\nOne could seek to make an advanced AGI by taking a chatbot, and trying to improve its code\nto make it actually understand what it’s talking about. We have some direct experience with\nthis route, as in 2010 our AI consulting firm was contracted to improve Ray Kurzweil’s online\nchatbot \"Ramona\". Our new Ramona understands a lot more than the previous Ramona version\nor a typical chatbot, due to using Wikipedia and other online resources, but still it’s far from\nan AGI.\n\nA more ambitious attempt in this direction was Jason Hutchens’ a-i.com project, which\nsought to create a human child level AGI via development and teaching of a statistical learning\nbased chatbot (rather than the typical rule-based kind). The difficulty with this approach,\nhowever, is that the architecture of a chatbot is fundamentally different from the architecture\nof a generally intelligent mind. Much of what’s important about the human mind is not directly\nobservable in conversations, so if you start from conversation and try to work toward an AGI\narchitecture from there, you’re likely to miss many critical aspects.\n\n1.6.3 Emulating the Brain\n\nOne can approach AGI by trying to figure out how the brain works, using brain imaging and\nother tools from neuroscience, and then emulating the brain in hardware or software.\n\nOne rather substantial problem with this approach is that we don’t really understand how\nthe brain works yet, because our software for measuring the brain is still relatively crude. There\nis no brain scanning method that combines high spatial and temporal accuracy, and none is\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_012922\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

For years now it has been my dream to attend your\nMBA program, studying amongst the world’s best professors and most achieved students to earn the edu-\ncation that will influence the rest of my career and the future of my company. To explain how much | also\nhope to contribute at Harvard, | would like to tell you three stories that characterize who | am.\n\nMy first story is about family.\n\nA small-town Italian from a modest family, my father worked locally as an industrial designer after high school,\nbut he always wanted to be an entrepreneur. Thirty-four years ago, at the age of 22, as soon as he sawa\nmarket opportunity, he quit his job (defying his parents), linked his talents for design and sports, and hand-\nbuilt his first piece of gym equipment in his garage; that was the beginning of Technogym. By the time | arrived,\nseven years later, Technogym had earned a respected place in the international market. Nine years later,\nwhen my younger brother was born, it was the world-leading and most innovative manufacturer of fitness\nequipment, digital wellness solutions and rehabilitation systems. It now has annual revenues of over 555m€\nand 35 million daily users in over 100 countries. My father directs some 2,000 staff as CEO and Chairman.\nThousands of talented people have contributed to Technogym, among them my mother, my brother, and I.\nTechnogym has been like my older sibling, and has always been the main topic of conversation at dinner. We\nplan our vacations around it and have supported one another through its ups and downs. We have all made\nsacrifices — but gladly, as one always does for family.\n\nMy father’s vision to bring “wellness” to people around the world inspired me to get involved at a very young\nage, so many of my childhood memories involve weekends at the office with my dad. These early experiences\nembedded in me the entrepreneurial values that make my father such a successful person, values such as\ntaking calculated risks and investing in innovation. | have attended countless meetings at his side and worn a\ncompany T-shirt at every Olympics from Athens 2004 to Rio 2016, as Technogym has been the games’ official\nsupplier since 2000.\n\nGrowing up in a family business has given me access to a vast network of people and | have sought to learn\nas much as | could from inspiring people like Richard Branson and Marc Benioff; however, the person | admire\nthe most is my mother, who put aside her own education and career to commit to our family and company.\nShe’s been at my father’s side since she was 16. Women have played a huge role in business and society,\nand | want to do my part to further opportunities for women, joining the long legacy of leaders who proudly\ncall themselves Harvard alumnae. | intend to participate in the Women’s Student Association to become one\nof the voices that carries this power beyond the campus. A Harvard education will help me develop the vision,\nleadership and credibility that | will need throughout my career, and in furthering great causes that mean a lot\nto me.\n\nNext, I'd like to talk about commitment.\n\n| understood early that | would always participate with my father's legacy and lead Technogym. | committed\nmyself to learning languages at school, becoming a good teammate and competitor through sports, and\nspending my university holidays exploring different industries through internships. Yet | still wanted to set my\nown career and earn my own credibility. Whether conducting analyses at JP Morgan in Paris, selling high-\npriced artwork in Mexico City, or developing marketing campaigns for iconic brands like Bulgari and\nTifany&Co., | have built my own identity thanks to working alongside diverse, accomplished people. By\nadapting to different countries, cultures and industries, | have adopted new ways of thinking, working, and\neven speaking while also asserting myself and learning to make measurable contributions quickly.\n\nMy most impactful experience was volunteering for a UN’s World Food Program microfinance initiative in El\nSalvador, one of the world's poorest and most dangerous countries. | helped design and develop “Fondo\npara Agricultura,” an investment fund supporting 75,000 small farmers. There, | was warned not to walk\nalone or explore the city, but | have never seen such warm and generous people as the Salvadorans. | made\nlifelong friends with my colleagues and many locals, and | witnessed how even small efforts can impact the\nlives of many. | became active in our company’s foundation to spread goodwill in my own community.\nSince 2009, Technogym has been an invitee of the World Economic Forum in Davos as the ‘wellness indus-\ntry shaper’, a true honour for a company of its size. Accompanying my father to the Annual Meetings, | have\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_029102\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

We expect this trend to continue and to lead to an undersupplied market, with\nfinancial demand also finding its way into gold futures and physical gold bars and coins.\ne Additional demand support comes from central banks, which are likely to further increase their foreign\nreserve allocation to the yellow metal. At the same time the drag from India's jewelry demand is set to fade\nwith an already lower base in 2H11 and a stabilizing Indian rupee.\n¢ Securing sufficient investment demand to push prices sharply higher is different from securing the\nneeded demand over a long period of time, and along these lines we see less support for the price over a 6-\nmonth perspective. Secondly, from a portfolio perspective we currently prefer to take some risk off the\ntable instead of on, and we thus maintain our neutral stance on gold.\n\nA Positive scenario 6-month target: USD 2,250/oz\n¢ Unorthodox monetary policy measures by the Fed start to weaken the USD persistently. Moreover, the\nrisk of a Eurozone breakup intensifies, which triggers a tidal wave of investment demand for gold.\n\n& Negative scenario 6-month target: USD 1,450/oz\ne A hard landing of China and India or the Fed backing off from the recent monetary policy\nannouncements would be a key drag on the yellow metal. The latter would have the strongest impact.\n\nWhat we're watching\nPhysical demand/supply\n\nWhy it matters\n\nIn the months ahead, with the festive season in India starting and monsoon\nactivity having improved considerably, supporting rural incomes, Indian\nphysical demand is likely to pick up. Key dates: World Gold Council mid-\nNovember release.\n\nMining activity in South Africa is unlikely to return to normal in the coming\nmonths. Hence, we are closely tracking mining news from South Africa,\nincluding the aggregated PGM IP numbers to assess the overall situation.\n\nIn order to see the gold price reaching our target, investment inflows into\nphysically backed ETFs need to continue. To gauge investor interest in gold\n(sector) a build-up in futures positions is likely to materialize as well.\n\nKey dates: 2 Nov US payrolls; 8 Nov ECB meeting, 12 Dec Fed meeting\n\nInvestment flow\n\nMonetary policy\n\n2 UBS\n\nRecommendations\nTactical (up to 6 months)\n\nAlthough it is possible for gold to test its\nall-time high in the next three months, we\nare aware that the metal has already\nappreciated firmly ahead of the QE3\nannouncement, which requires an ever\ngrowing amount of investment demand\nto hold the current upward trajectory.\n\nStrategic (1 to 2 years)\n\nTo protect investors’ portfolios from\nunorthodox monetary policy measures,\nholding gold exposure is a viable and\nattractive strategy. Alternatively, we\nrecommend palladium as well as\nplatinum.

After 1948, he\nhad led a frustrating existence. A specialist in medieval Jewish history, he could\nnot find a place on the faculty at Hebrew University.

Soon, however, he was allowed to leave the\ncompound six days a week, 12 hours a day, for what was termed work release. Emily Michot E//CHOT@MIAMIHERALD.COM\n\n“We just decided that was the best way to accomplish what needed to be done here and the parties agreed that that sentence satisfied everyone’s\nrequirements,” Goldberger replied.\n\nSaid Judge Pucillo: “The taxpayers of Palm Beach County are going to pay 18 months to house this guy instead of DOC [the Department of Corrections]?”\nBelohlavek: “Right.”\nPucillo did not respond to a request for comment on the case.\n\nVillafafia, the lead federal prosecutor in Epstein’s case, was in the courtroom, but there’s no indication she objected to Epstein’s cozier jail\naccommodations.\n\nWhen he entered jail in July 2008, Epstein was arguably the most well-known inmate there. Records also show that Epstein hired Palm Beach sheriff's\ndeputies for his security details, paying them for the hours they spent monitoring him on work release at his West Palm Beach office, where he often\nstayed until 10 p.m., jail logs show.\n\nThe Herald reviewed their time sheets, showing that the deputies logged visitors coming and going to and from his office throughout the day. A record log\nof his visitors was kept in a safe, but the log no longer exists, according to a spokeswoman for the Palm Beach County Sheriff’s Office.\n\nOne deputy who often worked Epstein’s detail said that his assignment was to stay in a front reception room of Epstein’s office. Epstein was in a separate\noffice — with the door closed — most of the day as he accepted visitors, both male and female, the deputies’ logs show.\n\n“Tt was not our job to monitor what he was doing in that office,” the deputy,\nnow retired, told the Herald.\n\nIn their early reports in July 2008, the deputies referred to Epstein as\n“Gnmate”’ but within a few weeks the language had changed and he was\ncalled a “client.” He was occasionally allowed to take a break for lunch by\nsitting outside in a park, the records show, and they also gave him\npermission to scout for a new office. While on work release, he was required\nto wear an ankle bracelet to monitor his whereabouts.\n\nhttps://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/article2 19494920 html 4/3/2019\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_017973\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

Creativity is central to our progress and to all human endeavour.\n\nMusic provides the clue: unlike other forms of art, music is not representational. Unlike the outcome of the\nsciences, it was never discoverable or awaiting discovery. A Mahler symphony did not exist before Mahler created\nit.\n\nE.T.A. Hoffman, a contemporary of Beethoven's, famously said: \"Music reveals to man an unknown realm, a world\nquite separate from the outer sensual world surrounding him, a world in which he leaves behind all feelings\ncircumscribed by intellect in order to embrace the inexpressible.\"\n\nThis is not to turn our back on reason. Or to argue that modernism, with all its secular progress through education,\nindustrialisation, communications, transport and the centralised state, has not spectacularly endowed the world as\nno other movement before it. But a void exists between the drum-roll of mechanisation with its cumulative power of\nscience and the haphazard, explosive power of creativity and passion. Science is forever trying to undress nature\nwhile the artistic impulse is to be wrapped in it.\n\nWhile these approaches are different - perhaps often diametrically opposite - they inform related strands of thinking\nin ways that promote energy and vision.\n\nThis is what | have found when these forces are contemplated in tandem. When passion and reason vie with each\nother, the emerging inspiration is invariably deeper and of an altogether higher form. One is able to knit between\nthem, bringing into existence an overarching unity - a coherence - which fidelity to the individual strands cannot\nprovide.\n\nIn the world | have lived in, the world of politics, political economy and internationalism, the literature exists in\nabundance. But what is far from abundant are the frameworks for the intuitive resolution of complex problems that\nrequire multi-dimensional solutions.\n\nBut from where do we glean this extra dimensionality?\n\nFor me, it has always been from two sources: policy ambition in its own right and from imagination - the dreaming.\nPolicy ambition arising from Kant's higher self, and imagination promoted by those reliable wellsprings - music,\npoetry, art and architecture - blending the whole into a creative flux.\n\nThis collection of speeches reflects many of those interests and impulses - whether it be Joern Utzon's Opera\nHouse or the imperative of liberal internationalism in foreign policy or Neoclassicism, the future of native title or the\nrise of China. Each is related in a wider construct which is part and parcel of the way | have viewed and thought\nabout the world.\n\nWhile the speeches are from the period after my prime ministerial life and period in government, the impulse in\nwriting them came from the same framework and inclinations which informed my life in public office.\n\nThe speeches may be read individually or read together, subject to subject, idea to idea. Either way, a common\nthread informs them all.\n\n| trust this might be evident to the reader.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_029664\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

The case law is clear that on an abuse of process claim a\n“plaintiff must prove that the process was used for an immediate purpose other than that for\nwhich it was designed.” S&J Investments v. Payless Flea Market, Inc., 36 So.3d 909, 917 (Fla.\n4\" Dist. Ct. App. 2010) (citing Biondo v. Powers, 805 So.2d 67, 69 (Fla. 4\" Dist. Ct. App. 2002).\nAs.a consequence, “[w]here the process was used to accomplish the result for which it was\nintended, regardless of an incidental or concurrent motive of spite or ulterior purpose, there is no\nabuse of process.” Jd. (internal quotation omitted). Here, Edwards has fully denied any\nimproper motive, See Statement of Undisputed Facts, and Epstein has no evidence of any such\nmotivation. Indeed, it is revealing that Epstein chose not to ask even a single question about this\nsubject during the depenftiors of Edwards. In addition, all of the actions that Epstein complains\nabout were in fact used for the immediate purpose of furthering the lawsuits filed by L.M., E.W.,\nand Jane Doe. In other words, these actions all were both intended to accomplish and, in fact,\nsuccessfully “accomplished the results for which they were intended” -- whether it was securing\nadditional dixcavery or presenting a legal issue to the court handling the case or ultimately\nmaximizing the recovery of damages from Epstein on behalf of his victims. Accordingly,\n\nEdwards is entitled to summary judgment on any claim that he abused process for this reason as\n\nwell.\n\n13\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_013382\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

As I ran through the reason we’d come up with the plan — the bourgeoning\npower of Arafat and Fatah in Lebanon — he peered at me over his reading\nglasses and nodded. As I set out the details of the attack plan, he listened, with\nno obvious sign of approval or rejection. But after I'd finished, he dismissed it\nout of hand. He said that Arafat was no longer the battlefield commander whose\nforces had fought Israel in Karameh. “He’s fat. He’s political,” he said. “He is\nnot a target for this kind of operation.”\n\nAfter the Sabena hostage-rescue, Dado and the other senior officers in the\nkirya did seem more receptive to our trying to initiate operations, especially the\nplan to seize Syrian officers and trade them for the Israeli pilots. But such a\nmission required not just military or intelligence approval. Dayan, and possibly\nGolda as well, would have to sign off, and there was little immediate sign of\nthat. But, once again, events on the ground would force the issue. Early on the\nmorning of June 9, our intelligence intercepts gave us notice that the next day, a\ngroup of senior Syrian officers was going to make an inspection visit to the\neastern part of the Lebanese border area with Israel. We would have to move\nquickly. Within the space of 12 hours, we’d need to plan the attack, organize,\nequip and brief the assault teams, make the three-and-a-half-hour drive north,\nand cross into Lebanon.\n\nStill, I was determined to try, which marked the start of two of my most\nfrustrating weeks as Sayeret Matkal commander. The place where we planned\nto abduct the Syrians was an area I knew personally: the sparsely settled strip of\nland where Lebanon, Syria and Israel met, not far from where I’d helped\n“capture” several Syrian villages on the final day of the 1967 war. With the\nconvoy expected to pass through the next morning, we crossed the border a little\nbefore midnight on June 9. We lay in ambush in dense vegetation a few meters\noff a curve in the road, further reducing the time the Syrians would have to react\nonce they saw us. I stationed two other sayeret teams a few hundred yards away\nin either direction, so they could cut off the road once we attacked.\n\nBut as the convoy was approaching, I was suddenly contacted by the sayeret\nofficer we’d stationed in the command post back in Israel. He relayed a message\nfrom Motta Gur, the head of the northern command.

Laffer, Ph.D.\n\nSummary\nTo save you the agony of plodding through this fascinating, information-rich paper, I'll get straight to the point: Donald Trump\n\nwill be the next President of the United States after having won an easy victory over Hillary Clinton in November 2016. The\nreasons:\n\n|.) | Section one shows that the essential characteristics of the narrative for the Trump campaign and the Reagan campaign\nof 1980 are surprisingly similar, which would point to a Trump landslide.\n\nll.) Section two describes the poor state of the current economy using detrended GDP per adult, the ratio of employment-\nto-adult-population and new home sales per 1,000 adults and how these measures strongly indicate a Republican\nvictory.\n\nlll.) Using historical data for the Gallup poll question “are you satisfied” and presidential election dates, this section would\npoint to an overwhelming Republican win in November 2016.\n\nIV.) Relying on voter turnout data this year versus earlier years and party selection, the Republicans have a large advantage\ncoming into the Fall election.\n\nV.) Basing our forecast on the past eight years of Congressional elections—House and Senate—as well as state elections\nof house, senate and governors, the Republicans should be exceedingly confident about the upcoming presidential\nelection.\n\nVI.) Taking careful measure of what both Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump have done in the public eye, Trump has the\nissues on his side.\n\nI. 1979-1980 How the Reagan Revolution Began\nIn early 1979, a group of Ronald Reagan acolytes—some 10 to 15 in total—got together in Justin Dart’s office at Rexall (the\n\ncorner of La Cienega and Beverly) and there they formed the original Reagan Executive Advisory Committee. With very few\nexceptions (initially only me), this group had been called Reagan’s Kitchen Cabinet. Those present and those also invited\nincluded Justin Dart, Holmes Tuttle, Jack Wrather, Bill French Smith, Bill Wilson, Earle Jorgensen, Ben Biaggini, Ted\nCummings, Alfred Bloomingdale, Charles Wick, Henry Salvatori et moi. | was the youngest of the group by three decades.\nAnd, in fact, the only way Justin Dart could convince the others to let me be a member was that they needed someone to keep\nthe minutes of the meetings, i.e. as a secretary. In speaking with a reporter about the Kitchen Cabinet, here’s what Jus Dart\nhad to say: “In addressing the question of how many of Reagan's friends actually qualify as members, Dart said: ‘Damn fewer\nthan is generally advertised.’”\"' That just says it all.\n\nThe purpose of this committee was to provide guidance and support to the emerging presidential candidacy of one Ronald\nReagan. The members were to a person close, close, close friends and supporters of Ronald Reagan or husbands of Nancy\nReagan’s best friends. And the race for the White House began.\n\nDuring this pre-primary and primary process, Ronald Reagan was disrespected and abused by a significant segment of the\nRepublican establishment. He was called an empty suit, a trigger-happy California cowboy, only an actor, a person who\nspoke words others wrote, a racist, a bigot, a divorcée, a war monger and the man who would start the Third World War. My\nfavorite slur came from none other than the Democratic Party’s “éminence grise” Clark Clifford? who referred to Ronald\nReagan as an “amiable dunce.” The torrent of anti-Reagan epithets never stopped.\n\n1 “industrialist Justin Dart has declared President Reagan's ‘kitchen cabinet',” United Press International, March 26, 1981.\nhttp:/Awww.upi.com/Archives/1981/03/26/Industrialist-Justin-Dart-has-declared-President-Reagans-kitchen-cabinet/4240354430800/\n\n2 There is a display at the Young Americans Foundation in Santa Barbara of a number of these anti-Reagan videos by any number of Republican and\nDemocratic stalwarts.\n> As if receiving divine retribution for his nasty ways, Clark Clifford, who served as Secretary of Defense for President Johnson and as an advisor to\nPresidents Truman, Kennedy and Carter, was indicted in the early 1990s on charges of conspiracy, fraud and bribery surrounding the Bank of Credit\nand Commerce International scandal.\nFor more, see: http:/Avww.nytimes.com/1998/1 0/1 1/us/clark-clifford-a-major-adviser-to-four-presidents-is-dead-at-91.html?pagewanted=all\n\n103 Murphy Court, Nashville, TN 37203 (615) 460-0100 FAX (615) 460-0102\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_025296\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

The\nObserver's television critic once wrote that if he ever found himself sitting next to Humphrys at a\ndinner party he would probably drive a fork through his hand. The Tory politician Jonathan\nAitken accused him of ‘poisoning the well of democratic debate’, a comment which prompted an\noutburst of support for Humphrys, with the Daily Mail describing him as ‘one of the most brilliant\n\njournalists in the country’.\n\nThis autumn, as Humphrys steps down after 32 years at Today and publishes a long-awaited\nmemoir, he comes to the Intelligence Squared stage to give an exclusive, behind-the-scenes\n\naccount of his extraordinary career.\n\nTurning the tables on Humphrys and pitching the questions will be his Today colleague Justin\nWebb. Humphrys will recount the momentous episodes of his career, such as his interview with\nBBC correspondent Andrew Gilligan in 2003. Gilligan claimed that the government had\ndeliberately ‘sexed up’ the dossier on the threat posed by Saddam Hussein in order to justify\nthe Iraq War. A chain of events ensued, including the suicide of the dossier’s source, Dr David\nKelly, severe damage to Tony Blair's reputation and the Hutton and Chilcot inquiries into the\nwar. And then there was the time Humphrys helped to get his own boss fired. His tough\ninterview with the BBC Director General George Entwistle, days after the BBC had made false\nchild abuse allegations against Lord McAlpine, lead to Entwistle’s resignation after a mere 53\n\ndays in the job.\nJoin us on October 9 and hear Humphrys’ previously untold stories about politicians, celebrities\n\nand the BBC, and give his trenchant views on the role of the media in politics and the health of\n\nour political system.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_030447\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

A general intelligence is then understood as one that can do this for a variety of\ncomplex goals in a variety of complex environments.\n\nHowever, apart from positing definitions, it is difficult to say anything nontrivial about gen-\neral intelligence in general. Marcus Hutter [Hut05] has demonstrated, using a characterization\nof general intelligence similar to the one above, that a very simple algorithm called AIXI” can\ndemonstrate arbitrarily high levels of general intelligence, if given sufficiently immense com-\nputational resources. This is interesting because it shows that (if we assume the universe can\neffectively be modeled as a computational system) general intelligence is basically a problem of\ncomputational efficiency. The particular structures and dynamics that characterize real-world\ngeneral intelligences like humans arise because of the need to achieve reasonable levels of intel-\nligence using modest space and time resources.\n\nThe “patternist” theory of mind presented in [GoeQ6a] and briefly summarized in Chap-\nter 3 below presents a number of emergent structures and dynamics that are hypothesized to\ncharacterize pragmatic general intelligence, including such things as system-wide hierarchical\nand heterarchical knowledge networks, and a dynamic and self-maintaining selfmodel. Much of\nthe thinking underlying CogPrime has centered on how to make multiple learning components\ncombine to give rise to these emergent structures and dynamics.\n\n2.1.2 What Is Human-like General Intelligence?\n\nGeneral principles like “complex goals in complex environments” and patternism are not suf-\nficient to specify the nature of human-like general intelligence. Due to the harsh reality of\ncomputational resource restrictions, real-world general intelligences are necessarily biased to\nparticular classes of environments. Human intelligence is biased toward the physical, social and\nlinguistic environments in which humanity evolved, and if AI systems are to possess humanlike\ngeneral intelligence they must to some extent share these biases.\n\nBut what are these biases, specifically? This is a large and complex question, which we seek\nto answer in a theoretically grounded way in Chapter 9. However, before turning to abstract\ntheory, one may also approach the question in a pragmatic way, by looking at the categories of\nthings that humans do to manifest their particular variety of general intelligence. This is the\ntask of the following section.\n\n2.2 Commonly Recognized Aspects of Human-like Intelligence\n\nIt would be nice if we could give some sort of “standard model of human intelligence” in this\nchapter, to set the context for our approach to artificial general intelligence — but the truth is\nthat there isn’t any. What the cognitive science field has produced so far is better described as:\na broad set of principles and platitudes, plus a long, loosely-organized list of ideas and results.\nChapter 5 below constitutes an attempt to present an integrative architecture diagram for\nhuman-like general intelligence, synthesizing the ideas of a number of different AGI and cognitive\ntheorists. However, though the diagram given there attempts to be inclusive, it nonetheless\ncontains many features that are accepted by only a plurality of the research community.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_012936\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

Both before\nand after becoming perfectly human both physiologically and in their mental potential,\nthey were monstrously inhuman in the actual content of their thoughts. I’m not referring\nto their crimes or even their cruelty as such: Those are all too human. Nor could mere\ncruelty have reduced progress that effectively. Things like “the thumbscrew and the\nstake / For the glory of the Lord” ?° were for reining in the few deviants who had\nsomehow escaped mental standardization, which would normally have taken effect long\nbefore they were in danger of inventing heresies. From the earliest days of thinking\nonward, children must have been cornucopias of creative ideas and paragons of critical\nthought— otherwise, as I said, they could not have learned language or other complex\nculture. Yet, as Jacob Bronowski stressed in The Ascent of Man:\n\nFor most of history, civilisations have crudely ignored that enormous\npotential... . [C]hildren have been asked simply to conform to the image\nof the adult... . The girls are little mothers in the making. The boys are\nlittle herdsmen. They even carry themselves like their parents.\n\nBut of course, they weren’t just “asked” to ignore their enormous potential and\nconform faithfully to the image fixed by tradition: They were somehow trained to be\npsychologically unable to deviate from it. By now, it is hard for us even to conceive of\nthe kind of relentless, finely tuned oppression required to reliably extinguish, in\neveryone, the aspiration to progress and replace it with dread and revulsion at any novel\nbehavior. In such a culture, there can have been no morality other than conformity and\nobedience, no other identity than one’s status in a hierarchy, no mechanisms of\ncooperation other than punishment and reward. So everyone had the same aspiration in\nlife: to avoid the punishments and get the rewards. In a typical generation, no one\ninvented anything, because no one aspired to anything new, because everyone had\nalready despaired of improvement being possible. Not only was there no technological\ninnovation or theoretical discovery, there were no new worldviews, styles of art, or\ninterests that could have inspired those. By the time individuals grew up, they had in\neffect been reduced to Als, programmed with the exquisite skills needed to enact that\nstatic culture and to inflict on the next generation their inability even to consider doing\notherwise.\n\nA present-day AI is not a mentally disabled AGI, so it would not be harmed by\nhaving its mental processes directed still more narrowly to meeting some predetermined\ncriterion. “Oppressing” Siri with humiliating tasks may be weird, but it is not immoral\nnor does it harm Siri. On the contrary, all the effort that has ever increased the\ncapabilities of Als has gone into narrowing their range of potential “thoughts.” For\nexample, take chess engines. Their basic task has not changed from the outset: Any\nchess position has a finite tree of possible continuations; the task is to find one that leads\nto a predefined goal (a checkmate, or failing that, a draw). But the tree is far too big to\n\n8 Matt Ridley, in The Rational Optimist, rightly stresses the positive effect of population on the rate of\nprogress. But that has never yet been the biggest factor: Consider, say, ancient Athens versus the rest of the\nworld at the time.\n\n*° Alfred, Lord Tennyson, Zhe Revenge (1878).\n\n87\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_016890\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

The allegations first surfaced in British newspapers, which have zeroed in on Epstein’s\nfriendship with Prince Andrew, who has recently tried to publicly disassociate himself from his old pal.\n\nI wrote a piece for Vanity Fair in 2003 called “The Talented Mr. Epstein.” It was largely a business piece that focused on his\nmysterious exit from Bear Stearns in 1981, his close relationships with Jimmy Cayne, Les Wexner, the chairman of Limited\nBrands, and above all, the man who claimed to be his mentor, Steven Jude Hoffenberg, who is currently serving a 20-year-jail\nsentence for bilking investors in Towers Financial out of $450 million.\n\nThe piece alluded to Epstein’s great friendship with Maxwell, and how she introduced him to young women with whom he had\nsexual relationships. But, in the end, the story didn’t really go there, focusing instead on the issue that remains a mystery—how\nJeffrey made his money, and how Ghislaine made hers.\n\nThis is not to say I didn’t hear stories about the girls. I did. But, not knowing quite who to believe, I concentrated on the intriguing\nfinancial mystery instead. But now the women have come back. Not the same ones, different ones. And their stories are bone-\nchilling. Journalists from England have phoned—and, in one case, flown—to ask me about Epstein and Maxwell. Who is he?\nAnd the British, especially, want to know: Who is she? At this point, Iam so bored of repeating myself to others—it was, after all,\nmy 2003 Vanity Fairstory that really brought him into the limelight—that I have decided to write about this myself.\n\nBizarrely, perhaps, I have gotten to know Jeffrey and Ghislaine far better after my piece than before it. | kept running into both of\nthem, separately, at parties. Jeffrey is not a social animal so he usually has a couple of young women with him who stand two feet\nbehind him, as if serving a monarch. “Do they speak?” I remember asking him once, nodding at his lookalike blondes. He\nlaughed. “Not like vou, Vicky,” was his riposte.\n\nIremembered that when we'd once discussed math—in particular, an isosceles triangle—and I revealed I hadn’t studied math\n\nsince I was 14 (such is, or was, the way of the British educational system), I received a package at home via messenger.

Embracing a comprehensive and\nhumane design philosophy, Safdie is committed to\narchitecture that supports and enhances a project’s\nprogram; that is informed by the geographic, social, and\ncultural elements that define a place; and that responds to\nhuman needs and aspirations. Safdie has completed a wide\nrange of projects, such as cultural, educational, and civic\ninstitutions; neighborhoods and public parks; mixed-use\nurban centers and airports; and master plans for existing\ncommunities and entirely new cities around the world.\n\nMajor projects by Safdie Architects currently under\nconstruction or recently completed include Mamilla Alrov\nCenter, a dynamic urban center near the Old City in Jerusalem;\nMarina Bay Sands, a mixed-use integrated resort in Singapore;\nKhalsa Heritage Memorial Complex, the national museum\nof the Sikh people in the Punjab, India; the United States\nInstitute of Peace Headquarters on the Mall in Washington,\nD.C.; the National Campus for the Archeology of Israel in\n\nJerusalem; Golden Dream Bay, a high-density residential\nproject in Qinhuangdao, China; the Kauffman Center for the\nPerforming Arts in Kansas City, Missouri; and the Crystal\nBridges Museum of American Artin Bentonville, Arkansas.\n\nBorn in Haifa, Israel, in 1938, Safdie moved to\nCanada with his family at a young age. He graduated from\nMcGill University in 1961 with a degree in architecture.\nAfter apprenticing with Louis I. Kahn in Philadelphia, Safdie\nreturned to Montreal to oversee the master plan for the\n1967 World Exhibition. In 1964 he established his own firm\nto realize Habitat ’67, an adaptation of his thesis at McGill,\nwhich was the central feature of the World’s Fair and a\ngroundbreaking design in the history of architecture.\n\nIn 1970, Safdie established a Jerusalem branch office,\ncommencing an intense involvement with the rebuilding of\nJerusalem. He was responsible for major segments of the\nrestoration of the Old City and the reconstruction of the new\ncenter, linking the Old and New Cities. Over the years, his\ninvolvement expanded and included the new city of Modi’in,\n\nthe new Yad Vashem Holocaust Museum, and the Rabin\nMemorial Center. During this period, Safdie also became\n\ninvolved in the developing world, working in Senegal, Iran,\nSingapore, and in the northern Canadian arctic. In 1978,\nafter teaching at Yale, McGill, and Ben Gurion Universities,\nSafdie relocated his residence and principal office to Boston.\nHe served as Director of the Urban Design Program at\nHarvard University Graduate School of Design from 1978 to\n1984, and Ian Woodner Professor of Architecture and Urban\nDesign from 1984 to 1989. In the following decade, he was\nresponsible for the design of six of Canada’s principal public\ninstitutions, including the Quebec Museum of Civilization, the\nNational Gallery of Canada, and Vancouver Library Square.\nSafdie has worked with a wide range of clients,\nincluding municipal entities and government agencies,\ncolleges and universities, private developers, and non-\nprofit organizations and civic institutions. Many of his\nfirm’s buildings have become beloved regional and\nnational landmarks, including Exploration Place Science\nCenter, Wichita, Kansas; Salt Lake City Public Library,\nSalt Lake City, Utah; Peabody Essex Museum, Salem,\nMassachusetts; Springfield Federal Courthouse, Springfield,\nMassachusetts; Skirball Cultural Center, Los Angeles,\nCalifornia; Lester B. Pearson International Airport,\nToronto, Canada; the National Gallery of Canada; and\nYad Vashem Holocaust Museum, Jerusalem, Israel.\nIn addition to numerous articles on the theory\nand practice of architecture, Safdie has written several\nbooks, most notably, Beyond Habitat (1970), For Everyone a\nGarden (1974), Form and Purpose (1982), and Jerusalem: The\nFuture of the Past (1989). The City After the Automobile (1997)\ndetails Safdie’s ideas about urbanism and city planning. A\ncomprehensive monograph of his work, Moshe Safdie I, was\npublished in 1996. Moshe Safdie II, a second monograph\nfeaturing work from 1996-2008, was published in 2009.\nSafdie has been featured in several films, including\nMoshe Safdie, The Power of Architecture, which is a portrait\nfilm (directed by Donald Winkler, 2004), My Architect: A\nSon’s Journey about Nathaniel Kahn and his father Louis\nI. Khan (directed by Nathaniel Kahn, 2003), and The\nSound of the Carceri, about Bach and Piranesi, with Yo-\nYo Ma (directed by Francois Girard, 1997). In the fall of\n2010, The National Gallery of Canada presented Global\nCitizen: The Architecture of Moshe Safdie, an exhibition that\nexplores the architect’s buildings and design philosophy.\nThe exhibition is co-sponsored by Crystal Bridges Museum\nof American Art and the Skirball Cultural Center.\nPast exhibitions of Safdie’s designs include Building\na New Museum (Peabody Essex Museum, 2003-2004); Moshe\nSafdie, Museum Architecture 1971-1998 (Tel Aviv University,\n1998); Moshe Safdie, Projects: 1979-1989 (Harvard University\nGraduate School of Design, 1989); and For Everyone a Garden\n(Baltimore Museum of Art, National Gallery of Canada,\nand San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, 1973-1974).\nSafdie has been the recipient of numerous\nawards, honorary degrees, and civil honors, including\nthe Companion of the Order of Canada and the Gold\nMedal of the Royal Architectural Institute of Canada.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_017556\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

(A few years ago,\nduring a chance encounter with a former Dalton math department chairman,\nMargo Gumport, I asked her about Epstein. She said he was the most\nbrilliant math teacher at Dalton in her 50-year career and that she had often\nwondered what had become of him.)\n\nIt’s his first exposure to the wealthy. They have, he concludes, just as\nmany problems as the people in Coney Island, just different ones, almost\ninvariably involving divorce and money. “I found it interesting as a science\nexperiment,” he recalled recently as we chatted about his life. “It did not\nreally involve me. I could just stand back and watch.”\n\nDalton fathers were attracted to him. Punch Sulzberger, the publisher\nof the New York Times, and a Dalton father at the time, tried to recruit\nEpstein to come to the Times. (Epstein recounts a story of riding with\nSulzberger in his wood paneled station wagon to the family’s country estate\nand Sulzberger talking to the chauffer on a phone from the backseat to the\nfront.)\n\nIn 1976, another Dalton father, asking “wouldn’t you rather be rich\nthan be a teacher?” introduced him to Bear Stern’s chief Ace Greenberg, a\nconversation Epstein recounts as this:\n\nGreenberg: “Everyone tells me you’re super smart in math and you’re\nJewish and you’re hungry...so why don’t you start working here\ntomorrow?”\n\nEpstein: “What?”\n\nGreenberg: “If your supposed to be so fucking smart, don’t you\nunderstand English?”\n\nEpstein: “Ok. Count me in.”\n\nHence, Epstein, like many in the late 70s, arrived on Wall Street.\n\nAs will happen to a generation of others, by the fortuitous luck of\nbeing on Wall Street at that point in time, Epstein is transformed by a new,\nmuch faster, form of upward mobility than has ever before existed. With a\nfacility for mathematics as well as for getting along with rich men, he\ntransforms at an even faster rate than so many others who are also being\nquickly transformed.\n\nHe moves into the penthouse of a new building at 66\" Street and\nSecond Avenue—still in the shadow of the Maxwell Plum era when the 60s\non Second was the glamour address—a building that was he says, as a fond\nmemory, full of “actresses, models, and euro trash.” (It would shortly\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_022755\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

I would never come to him for any\nother relationship advice, ever again. He told me I’d be fine if I just\nlistened to my mentor.

I\nhad just made loads of money from my previous trip and wanted to relax\nlike any teenager does, so I threw a hotel party that weekend on Singer\nIsland in Rivera Beach, inviting only a small group of friends to begin\nwith.\n\nThe hotel room quickly filled up with a flood of teens and the pumping\nmusic was blaring. The room had a balcony overlooking the pool and the\nbeach that became the smoker’s section. I wasn’t a real smoker at that\npoint, preferring to have a puff of a spiffed blunt instead so I made it my\nrule to go outside trying to prevent holes in the carpet, but it didn’t last\ntoo long when our forbidden walls came tumbling down. Making so\nmuch money that { could supply my wild parties with an assortment of\ndrugs like trips, ecstasy, and coke as well as an abundance of alcohol, that\nTJ had all the contacts for, made my fellow teens admire me.

Later that month, I was sent to Washington for talks with Syria’s\nambassador, Walid Muallem. With the Americans’ Mideast envoy, Dennis\nRoss, as host, we met in Blair House across the street from the White House.\n\nI began by explaining the security provisions we envisaged for the Golan,\nwhich included early-warning provisions, force limitations and other means of\nsafeguarding Israel against any surprise attack. Muallem’s response was\nformulaic, almost icy, with no indication he was ready to discuss any of the\nspecifics, much less offer ideas of his own. But then Dennis led us out into the\ngarden, where the atmosphere, if sadly not the weather, was a bit warmer. I told\nAmbassador Muallem I believed Israel’s issues with Syria ought to be\nresolvable. Both sides understood the broad terms of an eventual peace. But we\nneeded a context of trust in which to negotiate. President Assad, and we as well,\nwere always going to be reluctant formally to commit ourselves to a position\nuntil each side was be satisfied that the other side understood its core needs.\nPolitically, both sides also faced constraints. “In formal meetings, a record is\ntaken and negotiators have to explain and justify every last word back home,” I\nsaid. “I think our negotiators can get further in conversations like the one we’re\nhaving now.” Though Muallem nodded agreement, he did not explicitly say he\nbelieved that informal exchanges were the way forward. Still, he did obviously\npass back a broadly positive message to Damascus. Before the Blair House\ndiscussion, our understanding had been there would probably be a kind of\nmirror arrangement for a follow-up meeting: between our ambassador in\nWashington, Itamar Rabinovich, and a high-ranking army officer from the\nSyrian side. Instead, we received word that Assad wanted me to meet directly\nwith General Himat Shihabi, who was not only my counterpart as Syrian chief-\nof-staff but Assad’s oldest and closest political ally and the effective number-\ntwo man in the régime.\n\nGeneral Shihabi and I met over a period of two days at Blair House.

The debate gets testy\nwhen we consider that means short of force, such as sanctions and\ncovert technical sabotage, might not work.\n\nIt may be too simple to reduce the argument to just two sides—those\nwho fear the regime’s acquisition of nuclear weapons more than the\nconsequences of a war to prevent it, and those who fear the\nconsequences of a war above all else—but in this case simplicity has\nthe virtue of capturing the essence as observers ponder which set of\nunpalatable risks they would rather run. What is remarkable, though\nhardly surprising, is that the two sides usually put forth very different\nassessments of what using force would entail.

Edmond de Rothschild has an outstanding track record, history and \npresence in European infrastructure, as well as being one of Europe's most recognized financial advisors to \nthe infrastructure market. We have developed deep expertise in the infrastructure sector and sought secure, \nwell-managed assets, generating stable, long-term returns for investors. \nWe have done so by initiating and backing two experienced and highly-respected managers in the industry, \nTIIC and BRIDGE. TIIC is an equity investor in transport and social infrastructure. BRIDGE is an infrastructure \ndebt provider. Both managers are covered in more detail below. Edmond de Rothschild has been heavily \ninvolved in the launch of the below funds, providing crucial support in fund structuring, due diligence, capital \nraising, legal & compliance functions as well as the sound governance and ESG management across all funds. \nPartnering with TIIC and BRIDGE has enabled Edmond de Rothschild to build a strong franchise within \ninfrastructure investments, complementing its overall Private Equity offering. Edmond de Rothschild has also \nacted as anchor investor for these funds, demonstrating its strong alignment of interest with these \ninvestment teams. With Ariane we strongly believe that we should absolutely find a way to collaborate \ntogether with you to think and initiate something to serve the future needs of the US in the infrastructure \nfield. \nPlease find attached further information on each manager. This would also be a chance for us to explore \nopportunities of working together in the future. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 026059 \nPlease feel free to reach out to us if you require any further information. We look forward to hearing from \nyou soon. \nTIIC \nTIIC Group backed by Edmond de Rothschild, is a pan-European infrastructure firm advising on mid-market \ninfrastructure projects across Europe in both the transportation and social sectors. It was established in 2008 \nby the 3 founding partners of TIIC Group, Jaime d'Almeida, Manuel Cary and Francisco Mendes, with strategic \nsupport from the Edmond de Rothschild Group and Brisa. \nThe aim of TIIC Group is to bring an operational approach to infrastructure investments in Europe, drawing \nupon the extensive management and financial skills of its team members. These skills have been developed \nover many years at some of Europe's leading infrastructure operators and project financing firms which, \nwhen combined with the very specific infrastructure expertise of both the Edmond de Rothschild Group and \nBrisa, makes for a powerful and differentiated investment platform. \nTIIC Group operates from two offices in Lisbon and Paris, providing its team with access to relevant \ninvestment opportunities across key target markets in Europe as well as to leading industrial contractors, \noperators, advisors and financiers in the infrastructure industry. \nTIIC Group successfully raised a First Fund with €140m of commitments targeting transportation investments \nacross Europe. The portfolio of the First Fund comprises 6 assets located in Portugal, Spain, France and \nPoland. They represent a carefully balanced mix of greenfield and early stage brownfield projects in roads \nand car parks. TIIC Group has played an active role in the sourcing and development of all investments and \nhas made a significant contribution to value creation. TIIC Group believes that this is a high quality, \noperationally secure, cash yielding portfolio of assets which will be of strong interest to potential investors \nover the coming few years. \nTIIC has launched a successor fund, TIIC 2, which will build upon TIIC Group' differentiated approach to \ninfrastructure in Europe. TIIC 2 will is targeting aggregate commitments from investors of €300m (€350m \nhard cap) to invest into both transportation and social infrastructure projects in Europe. TIIC 2 will also seek \nto invest, on a very selective basis, into greenfield social infrastructure projects in New Frontier Markets, \nwithin close proximity to the European Union. Given its powerful network of relationships across Europe and \nthe operational skills of its team, TIIC Group will continue to target superior investment returns for TIIC 2's \nportfolio of assets. These returns should be in line with the anticipated returns from the First Fund portfolio \nwhich is forecast to deliver a gross IRR of up to 14% and a multiple of approximately 2x on invested capital. \nTIIC announced the first close of TIIC 2 on December 30th 2016, with aggregate commitments of €135m from \na group of high quality and well-diversified limited partners. First close investors in TIIC 2 include the \nEuropean Investment Bank and Edmond de Rothschild, both with significant commitments, as well as the \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 026060 \nTIIC team. TIIC 2 is also supported by a number of existing investors, together with several European \ninsurance companies, pension funds and family offices. A second close is planned in the coming months and \nthe final close will occur before the end of 2017. We have received significant interest from a number of \nEuropean institutional investors, many of which are in the process of completing detailed due diligence on \nTIIC 2. We are firmly on track to achieve a final close of TIIC 2 before the end of the year. \nFurthermore, TIIC has announced the first exit from Fund 1, with outstanding returns. Three other \ninvestments are in sales processes and should close during the next few months. \nBRIDGE \nBRIDGE is an infrastructure debt platform initiated by Edmond de Rothschild Asset Management (EdRAM) to \nenable institutional investors to access infrastructure assets with secured and stable revenue streams. BRIDGE \nis a London based second generation debt fund sourcing and structuring transactions directly from sponsors \nwhen feasible and one of the few independent debt teams only investing on behalf of clients. The BRIDGE team \nhas the ability to execute and deliver transactions as efficiently as traditional lenders as well as negotiate terms \nand conditions bringing optimised yield and security to investors. \nThe BRIDGE platform was set up as a new leg of EDR's Infrastructure, Real Assets & Structured Finance Team \nstriving to take advantage of the expertise of the infrastructure sector acquired when the team became a global \nleader in PPP & Transport infrastructure financial advisory in 2011 and 2012. \nThe BRIDGE platform raised € 400m of new monies in 2016 and has successfully reached the €1bn mark of \nAssets under Management at the end of 2016. The platform comprises three investment vehicles (French FCT \nand Lux SIF) and is currently fundraising for additional pockets of liquidity: \no BRIDGE I reached final closing in December 2014 with approximately €600m of aggregate commitments from a club \nof institutional investors. \no BRIDGE I Dedicated Compartmentis a vehicle created by a large European institution and anchor investor of the first \nfund with a €250m target amount available for deployment. \no BRIDGE II reached first close in December 2016 with €150m of commitments in order to invest in three transactions. \nFundraising for BRIDGE ll is still ongoing, targeting a group of institutional investors in Europe and elsewhere, with final \ntarget size of €600m. \nThe BRIDGE platform has a long-term European investment strategy and a mandate to cover all sectors of \ninfrastructure, notably energy, renewables, utilities, transportation, telecommunications and social \ninfrastructure and can execute project financing, refinancing and acquisition finance transactions. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 026061 \nThe BRIDGE platform currently comprises investments of between €20420 million each, in 17 European \ninfrastructure transactions. In 2016 alone, the BRIDGE team has achieved financial close for 11 infrastructure \ndeals in Europe aggregating ca. €390m. When benchmarked against other similar funds, the investment team \nhas succeeded in deploying faster and with credit spreads well above the infrastructure senior debt benchmark, \nenabling BRIDGE to become a force in the growing institutions-backed infrastructure debt market. BRIDGE's \nability to invest beyond the traditional definition of core infrastructure and to structure transactions was a key \ndifferentiator when Edmond de Rothschild launched this platform, as part of its commitment to real economy. \nBRIDGE is innovative in the sense that the investment team sources transactions directly from sponsors and is \nactively involved in the structuring phase, acting as Mandated Lead Arranger. \nBRIDGE comprises a large, international and skilled London based investment team of 11 investment \nprofessionals who between them have arranged more than €100bn of landmark infrastructure deals over the \nlast 20 years across the globe. The BRIDGE team is among the largest within the debt funds universe and \ndemonstrates the Edmond de Rothschild Group's commitment to the platform. \nKind regards, \nJohnny \nJohnny el HACHEM \nEdmond de Rothschild Private Equity \n29 Route de Pre-Bois \nCase postale 490 \n1215 Geneve 15 \nSuisse \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 026062 \nplease note \nThe information contained in this communication is \nconfidential, may be attorney-client privileged, may \nconstitute inside information, and is intended only for \nthe use of the addressee.

Making the task even more risky, according to my Booz\nAllen source, there were closed-circuit cameras. The only way he\ncould mitigate the risk of detection was by having someone help\nhim build this network.\n\nEven if Snowden had managed to obtain all the necessary pass-\nwords from colleagues, he would have had to transfer the files to an\nexternal storage device. This was not a matter of simply attaching\na thumb drive or other external device to a port, because, unlike in\nmovies such as Mission: Impossible, the ports on the computers at\nthe NSA were ordinarily sealed shut.

Terrorism, no less than the worst Arab\nattacks on Israeli civilians. The settler was named Baruch Goldstein, a\nphysician, who lived in Kiryat Arba. One of the first post-1967 Jewish\nsettlements, it sat on a hill outside the West Bank town of Hebron. At the heart\nof Hebron lay the burial place of the patriarchs and matriarchs of the Jewish\nfaith: Abraham and Sarah; Isaac and Rebecca; Jacob and Leah. Since Abraham\nis also revered as a prophet in Islam and a mosque had stood on the site for\nnearly a thousand years, our post-1967 arrangements set out separate times of\nworship for Muslims and Jews. Goldstein chose to attack during a holiday\nperiod for both faiths: Purim for the Jews and the Muslim holy month of\nRamadan. He arrived shortly after the Muslims’ Friday prayers began on the\nmorning on February 25. He was dressed in his reserve army uniform and was\ncarrying an automatic rifle. He opened fire on a group of nearly 800 Palestinian\nworshipers. He had killed 29 and wounded 125 others by the time several of his\nintended victims knocked him unconscious and beat him to death.\n\nI rushed to Sde Dov airport in north Tel Aviv, a few minutes from the kirya,\nand boarded a helicopter for the old British fort near Hebron, used by the\nJordanians until 1967 and now Israeli headquarters. After visiting the scene of\nthe killings, I sought out local Palestinian leaders, to voice my condolences and\nthe sense of outrage I shared over what had happened, and to urge them to do all\nthey could to maintain calm. I then went to Kiryat Arba and conveyed the same\nmessage.\n\nOur immediate task was to prevent more deaths, on either side. It was a\nfrustrating, and violent, week. Protests reminiscent of the first days of the\nintifada erupted around the West Bank, in Gaza, in east Jerusalem and in several\nArab neighborhoods and towns inside Israel. While I had no trouble\nunderstanding the Palestinians’ anger, I also had a responsibility to prevent the\nviolence spiraling out of control. We turned to the same tools we’d used at the\nbeginning of the uprising — though with even greater emphasis on the need for\nsoldiers to use the only the necessary force to restore order, and to avoid causing\nfatalities wherever possible. We closed off the West Bank. We imposed curfews\n\n258\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_028106\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

There was a throw rug on\nthe ground that he had already placed out as he began to strip down in\npreparation of the massage.

He complied with a cheeky smile and from his eagerness to\nshow he was not shy indeed, I already knew where this was going to end\nup.\nI found it much more strenuous to massage on the floor but I wouldn’t\nlet that hold me back I wanted to have a career and this being my first\never clients, I didn’t want them to disapprove. Nearly four hours after I\nhad gotten there I was still hard at work.

When\nhe had climaxed, we both got up and dressed and he paid mea large tip\neven though Jeffrey would be the one to actually pay me for my time\nspent there. Just like it had all started, it had also ended so quickly and\nnow that was that. I had to accept what my duties were and now | could\ngo back to Jeffrey who would be further pleased in my demonstrations to\nkeep him happy.\n\nI was called the next morning to come over to Jeffrey’s mansion that\nafternoon for lunch, a swim and of course a massage session. Knowing\nall too well they’d be expecting the gory details of last nights events with\nmy new clientele. I came there at lpm as requested and sat down for a\nlight lunch and a swim. Jeffrey was mostly conducting business from his\noffside pool office, but he came to ask me if everything went well the\nnight before. I told him I did everything asked of me and am quite\nconfident both my client’s were more than pleased with me.

He never took too long with his work, unless there was\nsomething wrong and then we would all have to wear his mood but today\nhe seemed fine though, when we went up the stairs he told me we would\nbe leaving for his ranch in Santa Fe’, New Mexico in the morning and I’d\nneed to be packed and ready tonight. They loved leaving in the spur of\nthe moment, Jeffrey once said he checks with his pilot Larry on the best\nweather before he heads to a different destination. I enjoyed spending\ntime at his ranch being it was my favorite of all of his residences. He had\na lavish Mediterranean looking castle on top of a hill that over looked his\nextensive 7,500 acres of property. It has an indoor pool, gym, and all the\ntrimmings of extravagance I could only imagine. I had a great time on the\nquad bikes, Sarah and I often got scolded for tipping one over going to\nfast or trying to go up a steep hill, but we knew those weren’t the things\nhe cared about, so it wouldn’t matter. My favorite of it all was his little\ntown with it’s own fire station and truck, stables full of horses, and little\ncottages where the housekeepers and ranch hands lived.\n\nOn my own time I would take one of the quad bikes down to the\nstables and saddle up on one of his beautiful horses and go for a ride in\nthe open terrain.

Arriving in only a few hours at his awe-inspiring Santa Fe\nPalace was always a delight. Still frisk in the air, my petite frame looked\neven smaller in these gigantic overcoats.

After a\nfew days of leisurely spending our time on the ranch, we went to the\nIndian markets in Albuquerque for a bit of shopping and sight seeing.\nJeffrey wasn’t the most off road kind of guy, so when we went sight\nseeing it was more like museums, boutique shopping, and local art\ngalleries.

Even if we did invent superhumanly intelligent robots,\nwhy would they want to enslave their masters or take over the world? Intelligence is the\nability to deploy novel means to attain a goal. But the goals are extraneous to the\nintelligence: Being smart is not the same as wanting something. It just so happens that\nthe intelligence in Homo sapiens is a product of Darwinian natural selection, an\ninherently competitive process. In the brains of that species, reasoning comes bundled\nwith goals such as dominating rivals and amassing resources. But it’s a mistake to\nconfuse a circuit in the limbic brain of a certain species of primate with the very nature of\nintelligence. There is no law of complex systems that says that intelligent agents must\nturn into ruthless megalomaniacs.\n\nA second misconception is to think of intelligence as a boundless continuum of\npotency, a miraculous elixir with the power to solve any problem, attain any goal. The\nfallacy leads to nonsensical questions like when an AI will “exceed human-level\nintelligence,” and to the image of an “artificial general intelligence” (AGI) with God-like\nomniscience and omnipotence. Intelligence is a contraption of gadgets: software modules\nthat acquire, or are programmed with, knowledge of how to pursue various goals in\nvarious domains. People are equipped to find food, win friends and influence people,\ncharm prospective mates, bring up children, move around in the world, and pursue other\nhuman obsessions and pastimes. Computers may be programmed to take on some of\nthese problems (like recognizing faces), not to bother with others (like charming mates),\nand to take on still other problems that humans can’t solve (like simulating the climate or\nsorting millions of accounting records). The problems are different, and the kinds of\nknowledge needed to solve them are different.\n\nBut instead of acknowledging the centrality of knowledge to intelligence, the\ndystopian scenarios confuse an artificial general intelligence of the future with Laplace’s\ndemon, the mythical being that knows the location and momentum of every particle in\nthe universe and feeds them into equations for physical laws to calculate the state of\neverything at any time in the future. For many reasons, Laplace’s demon will never be\nimplemented in silicon. A real-life intelligent system has to acquire information about the\nmessy world of objects and people by engaging with it one domain at a time, the cycle\nbeing governed by the pace at which events unfold in the physical world. That’s one of\nthe reasons that understanding does not obey Moore’s Law: Knowledge is acquired by\nformulating explanations and testing them against reality, not by running an algorithm\nfaster and faster. Devouring the information on the Internet will not confer omniscience\neither: Big Data is still finite data, and the universe of knowledge is infinite.\n\nA third reason to be skeptical of a sudden AI takeover is that it takes too seriously\nthe inflationary phase in the AI hype cycle in which we are living today. Despite the\nprogress in machine learning, particularly multilayered artificial neural networks, current\nAI systems are nowhere near achieving general intelligence (if that concept is even\ncoherent). Instead, they are restricted to problems that consist of mapping well-defined\ninputs to well-defined outputs in domains where gargantuan training sets are available, in\nwhich the metric for success is immediate and precise, in which the environment doesn’t\n\n81\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_016884\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

He co-founded Thinking\nMachines Corporation, a company that developed the\nConnection Machine, a parallel supercomputer designed\n\nby Hillis at MIT. He is also co-founder of the Long Now\nFoundation, Applied Minds, Metaweb Technologies,\n\nApplied Proteomics, and author of The Pattern on the\n\nStone: The Simple Ideas That Make Computers Work.\n\nDanny Hillis was born in Baltimore, Maryland\nin 1956. His father, William Hillis, was a US Air Force\nepidemiologist studying hepatitis in Africa and relocated with\nhis family through Rwanda, Burundi, Republic of the Congo,\nand Kenya. He spent a brief part of his childhood in Calcutta,\nIndia when his father was a visiting faculty at ISI, Calcutta.\nDuring these years the young Hillis was home schooled by his\nmother Aryge Briggs Hillis, a biostatistician, and developed an\nearly appreciation for mathematics and biology. His younger\nbrother is David Hillis, a professor of evolutionary biology\nat the University of Texas at Austin, and his sister is Argye E.\nHillis, a professor of neurology at Johns Hopkins University.\n\nIn 1978 Hillis graduated from MIT with a BS degree\nin mathematics, followed in 1981 with an MS\ndegree in Electrical Engineering and Computer\nScience (EECS), specializing in robotics.\n\nDuring this time Hillis worked at the MIT Logo\nLaboratory developing computer hardware and software for\nchildren. He designed computer-oriented toys and games\nfor the Milton Bradley Company, and co-founded Terrapin\nSoftware—a producer of computer software for elementary\nschools. He also built a digital computer composed of\n\nTinkertoys that is on display at the Museum of Science, Boston.\n\nHillis’ major research, however, was into parallel\ncomputing. Hillis designed the Connection Machine, a\nparallel supercomputer; in 1983 Hillis co-founded Thinking\nMachines Corporation to produce and market supercomputers\nbased on this design. In 1988, continuing this research, Hillis\nreceived a PhD in EECS from MIT under doctoral advisers\nGerald Jay Sussman, Marvin Minsky and Claude Shannon.\n\nHillis co-founded Thinking Machines Corporation in\n1983 while doing his doctoral work at MIT. The company was\nto develop Hillis’ Connection Machine design into commercial\nparallel supercomputers, and to explore computational\npathways to building artificial intelligence. Hillis’ ambitions\nare represented by the company’s motto: “We’re building\na machine that will be proud of us,” and Hillis’ parallel\narchitecture was to be the main component for this task:\n\nClearly, the organizing principle of the brain is\nparallelism. It’s using massive parallelism. The information\nis in the connection between a lot of very simple parallel\nunits working together. So if we built a computer that was\nmore along that system of organization, it would likely\nbe able to do the same kinds of things the brain does.\n\nAt Thinking Machines Corporation, Hillis\n\nbuilt a technical team with many people that would\n\nlater become leaders in science and industry including\nBrewster Kahle, Guy Steele, Sydney Brenner, David\nWaltz, Jack Schwartz, and Eric Lander. He even recruited\nRichard Feynman to spend his summers there. For many\nyears, Thinking Machines Corporation connection\nmachines were the fastest computers in the world.\n\nDuring 1994, however, Thinking Machines filed for\nbankruptcy. In 1996, after a short stint as a professor at the MIT\nMedia Lab, Hillis joined The Walt Disney Company full time\nin the newly created role of Disney Fellow and Vice President,\nResearch and Development, Walt Disney Imagineering,\nwhich Hillis claimed was an early ambition of his:\n\nI’ve wanted to work at Disney ever since I was a\nchild... remember listening to Walt Disney on television\ndescribing the ‘Imagineers’ who designed Disneyland.\n\nI decided then that someday I would be an Imagineer.\nLater, I became interested in a different kind of magic—\nthe magic of computers. Now I finally have the perfect\njob—bringing computer magic into Disney.\n\nAt Disney, Hillis developed new technologies as well\nas business strategies for Disney’s theme parks, television,\nmotion pictures, Internet and consumer products businesses.\nHe also designed new theme park rides, a full sized walking\nrobot dinosaur and various micro mechanical devices.\n\nHillis left Disney in 2000, taking with him Bran\nFerren, President of the Walt Disney Imagineering, R&D\nCreative Technologies division. Together, Ferren and Hillis\nfounded Applied Minds, a company aimed at providing\ntechnology and consulting services to firms in an array of\nindustries, including aerospace, electronics, and toys. In\nJuly 2005, Hillis and others from Applied Minds initiated\nMetaweb Technologies, Inc. to develop a semantic data storage\ninfrastructure for the Internet, and Freebase, an “open,\nshared database of the world’s knowledge”. When Metaweb\nwas acquired by Google, the technology became the basis\nof Google’s Knowledge Graph. Hillis, together with\nDr. David B. Agus, cofounded a spinoff of Applied Minds\ncalled Applied Proteomics Inc which designed and\nprototyped a machine that measures the level of proteins\nin the blood for medical diagnosis.\n\nHillis’ work with Agus on cancer led to the\nfounding of the University of Southern California\nPhysical Sciences-Oncology Center (USC PS-OC),\nfunded by the National Cancer Institute (NCI). Hillis\nis the principle investigator of this program.\n\nIn 1993, with Thinking Machines facing its demise,\nHillis wrote about long-term thinking and suggested a\nproject to build a clock designed to function for millennia:\n\nWhen I was a child, people used to talk about\nwhat would happen by the year 2000. Now, thirty years\nlater, they still talk about what will happen by the year\n\n2000. The future has been shrinking by one year per year\n\nfor my entire life. I think it is time for us to start a long-\nterm project that gets people thinking past the mental\nbarrier of the Millennium. I would like to propose a large\n(think Stonehenge) mechanical clock, powered by seasonal\ntemperature changes. It ticks once a year, bongs once a\ncentury, and the cuckoo comes out every millennium.\n\nThis clock became the Clock of the Long\nNow, a name invented by the songwriter and composer,\nBrian Eno. Hillis wrote an article for Wired magazine\nsuggesting a clock that would last over 10,000 years.\n\nThe project led directly to the founding of the Long Now\nFoundation in 1996 by Hillis and others, including Stewart\nBrand, Brian Eno, Esther Dyson, and Mitch Kapor.\n\nHillis asserts that parallelism itself is approximately\nthe main ingredient of intelligence; that there is not\nanything else required to make a mind result from a\ndistributed network of processors. Hillis believes that\n\n.. ntelligence is just a whole lot of little\nthings, thousands of them. And what will happen is\nwe Il learn about each one at a time, and as we doit,\nmachines will be more and more like people. It will\nbe a gradual process, and that’s been happening.\n\nThis is not so different from Marvin Minsky’s Society\nof Mind theory, which holds that mind is a collection of agents,\neach one taking care of a particular aspect of intelligence,\nand communicating with one another, exchanging\ninformation as required.\n\nSome artificial intelligence theorists have other\nopinions—that it’s not the underlying computational\nmode that’s crucial, but rather particular algorithms\n(of reasoning, memory, perception, etc.). Others\nargue that the right combination of “little things” is\nneeded to give rise to the overall emergent patterns of\ncoordinated activity that constitute real intelligence.\n\nHillis is one of a small number of people\nwho have made a serious attempt to create such a\n“thinking machine” and his ambitions are clear:\n\n“T’d like to find a way for consciousness to\ntranscend human flesh. Building a thinking machine is\nreally a search for a kind of Earthly immortality. Something\nmuch more intelligent than we can exist. Making a\nthinking machine is my way to reach out to that.”\n\nHillis’ 1998 popular science book The Pattern on the\nStone attempts to explain concepts from computer science for\nlaymen using simple language, metaphor and analogy. It moves\nfrom Boolean algebra through topics such as information\ntheory, parallel computing, cryptography, algorithms,\nheuristics, Turing machines, and promising technologies\nsuch as quantum computing and emergent systems.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_017542\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

There was no sex. An often there was no happy\nending. Often I would be on the phone for the entire massage. There were\nhowever a lot of massages and a lot of girls, with one girl recommending\nothers.”\n\nIt is after Epstein’s round of publicity and widely touted association\nwith Clinton, that the mother of one of the massage parlor girls who went to\nEpstein’s house (most of the girls return to Epstein’s house many times)\ncalls the police. The police interview the girl, Saige Gonzales, who then\nsupplies names of other girls. Some of whom are found to be younger than\n18.\n\nIn the end, the police track down 18 girls—nine who are under 18; the\nothers in their 20s and 30s; one woman is in her 60s—a number of whom\ngive statements describing scenarios not terribly different from Epstein’s\ndescription above, except each is laid out in clinical, lurid, and near-identical\ndetail.

(It somehow reads weirder that he doesn’t have sex with them.) To\nboot, his former girl friend, Ghislaine Maxwell—the daughter of the\ndisgraced Robert Maxwell—encouraged at least one of the girls to come to\nEpstein’s home (and forever more has become a fixture of further weird\npossibilities in this tale).\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_022741\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

But, in aggregate, there has been more improvement than deterioration, in our\nview.\n\nIn this Sunday Night Insight, we will provide a brief update on the steady factors and unsteady\nundertow. We then conclude with our view that the steady factors will likely continue to win this tug-of-\nwar between the two.\n\nSteady Factors\n\nWhile the headlines warn of equity market carnage, the facts do not support such alarming headlines.\nThe S&P 500 is still up 5.1% on a year-to-date total return basis and financial conditions remain at\neasier levels today than they did when the Federal Reserve began this tightening cycle in 2015,\ndespite the recent decline in equities and 0.76 percentage point increase in 10-year Treasury yields\nyear-to-date. Most importantly, as highlighted by Federal Reserve Chairman, Jerome Powell, we are\nin “extraordinary times” of steady growth and low inflation.\n\nEconomic Growth\n\nEconomic growth remains firm in the US. Both the Institute for Supply Management leading indexes\nfor manufacturing and non-manufacturing remain at very strong levels. Current activity indicators of\nreal GDP growth average about 3.5% for the third quarter and closer to 4% for the fourth quarter.\nForecasts for third quarter real GDP average 3.8% and fourth quarter forecasts are about\n\n2.8%. While growth is slowing from the 4.2% estimate of the second quarter, it is still forecast to be\nabove trend and we believe a modest slowdown is certainly preferable to continued growth at a pace\nthat was likely unsustainable and possibly even inflationary.\n\nIn aggregate, the economic data since the intraday peak of US equities on September 21st does not\npoint to any worrisome slowdown in GDP growth or the pace of employment. |n fact, while the recent\n134K increase in non-farm payrolls was less than expectations, revisions to earlier months offset the\nmodest headline miss and the unemployment rate still fell to 3.7%. Furthermore, this 134k increase\nis above the estimated sustainable level of employment growth based on population growth and\nchanges in labor force participation, which our colleagues in Goldman Investment Research estimate\nis around 96k. Importantly, a modest slowdown in the 3-month average of non-farm payrolls, which\ncurrently stands at a very robust 190k jobs, is more likely to keep inflation in check.\n\nRobust Earnings and Buybacks\n\nContinued above-trend economic growth is supporting solid corporate fundamentals. While many are\nquick to dismiss this strength to US tax reform, it is only half the story. Earnings before interest and\ntaxes (EBIT) expanded by a very healthy 12% in the first half of this year and are expected to grow by\ndouble-digits again in the third quarter. This robust organic profit growth is also fueling sizable\ncorporate buybacks—a key source of equity market support. Our colleagues on the corporate\nbuyback desk expect the highest dollar amount for buybacks on record in 2018, with $1tn in\nauthorizations and $850bn in executed buybacks.\n\nEven so, such robust earnings growth has begun to foster concern that we have reached a peak in\nEPS growth. While we do expect the pace of growth to slow next year, a local peak in earnings\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_026895\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

NLRB, 311 U.S. 7, 10-12 (1940).\nAnother comment argues that the Board\nshould not provide remedies for failing\nto post the notice because such\nremedies are not provided under other\nstatutes. In fact, both remedies and\nsanctions are imposed under some\nstatutes; see, e.g., 29 CFR 1601.30 (fine\nof $110 per offense for failing to post\nnotice under Title VII); 29 CFR\n825.300(a)(1) (same sanction for failing\nto post notice under FMLA); cases cited\nabove for tolling of limitation periods\nfor failing to post notices under several\nstatutes.\n\nOne comment contends that the\nproposed remedies were proposed\nsolely as means of deterring failures to\npost the notices, and are therefore\ninappropriate; several other comments\nassert that the proposed remedies are\npunitive.169 Although the Board\ndisagrees, there is language in the\nNPRM that may have inadvertently\nsuggested that the enforcement\nmechanisms were proposed solely for\ndeterrent purposes. The Board wishes to\ncorrect any such misimpression. As\nstated above, in explaining why it was\nproposing those mechanisms, the Board\nstated in its NPRM that it was “mindful\nof the need to identify effective\nincentives for compliance.” 75 FR\n80413. Later, referring to tolling the\n10(b) period and considering a willful\nfailure to post the notice as evidence of\nunlawful motive, the Board said that it\n“proposes the following options\nintended to induce compliance with the\nnotice-posting requirement.” Id. at\n80414. However, the Board made those\nstatements while explaining why it had\ndetermined not to rely entirely on\nemployers’ voluntary compliance with\nthe rule. (The Board had had little\nsuccess in persuading employers to\nvoluntarily post notices of employee\nrights during the critical period leading\nup to a representation election.) Id. By\nnoting that the proposed enforcement\nscheme would have some deterrent\neffect in that context, the Board did not\nmean to imply that it was proposing\nthose measures solely for deterrence\npurposes. For the reasons discussed at\nlength above, the Board has found that\nfinding a failure to post the notices to\nviolate Section 8(a)(1) and, in\nappropriate circumstances, to warrant\ntolling the 10(b) period and/or inferring\nunlawful motive in an unfair labor\npractice case are legitimate remedial\n\n169 See, e.g., comments of FMI, ALFA, AHCA.\n\nmeasures supported by extensive Board\nand court precedent.\n\nIn addition, in a number of places the\nNPRM used the term “sanctions” in a\nvery loose sense to refer to aspects of the\nproposed enforcement scheme,\ninadvertently suggesting that this\nscheme was punitive. The term\n“sanctions” was an inapt choice of\ndescriptor for the enforcement scheme:\nthe classic 8(a)(1) remedial order has\nlong been upheld as nonpunitive;\nequitable tolling is concerned with\nfairness to employees, not punishment\nof misconduct, and is fully consistent\nwith current Board doctrine; and the\nanimus provision is little more than the\ncommon-sense extension of well-\nestablished evidentiary principles that\napply to many other NLRA violations,\nand is also not designed to punish\nemployers. That they may also furnish\nincentives for employers to comply with\nthe notice-posting rule does not detract\nfrom their legitimacy; if it were\notherwise, the Board could never\nimpose any remedy for violations of the\nNLRA if the remedy had a deterrent\neffect. In any event, the Board hereby\ndisavows any suggestion from\nstatements in the NPRM that the\nremedial measures were proposed solely\nas penalties.\n\nContrary to the tenor of numerous\ncomments opposing this rule,17° the\nBoard is not issuing the rule in order to\nentrap unwary employers and make\noperations more difficult for them\nbecause of inadvertent or technical\nviolations. It is doing so in order that\nemployees may come to understand\ntheir NLRA rights through exposure to\nnotices posted in their workplaces\nexplaining those rights. Accordingly,\nthe important thing is that the notices be\nposted. As explained above, an\nemployer that fails to post the notice\nbecause it is unaware of the rule, but\npromptly posts the notice when the rule\nis brought to its attention, will nearly\nalways avoid any further proceedings.\nSimilarly, an employer that posts the\nnotice but fails initially to comply with\none of the technical posting\nrequirements will almost always avoid\nfurther problems by correcting the error\nwhen it is called to the employer's\nattention. And if an employer is unsure\nof what the rule requires in a particular\nsetting, it can seek and receive guidance\nfrom the Board.\n\nThe Service Employees International\nUnion and the United Food and\nCommercial Workers propose that, in\n\n170 For example, “This seems to be yet another\ntrap for the employers. Another avenue to subject\nthem to law suits and interrogations, and\nuneconomic activities and ungodly expenditures.”\n\naddition to the proposed enforcement\nscheme, the rule state that an\nemployer’s knowing failure to post the\nnotice of employee rights during the\ncritical period before a representation\nelection shall be grounds for setting the\nelection aside on the filing of proper\nobjections. The Board finds that this is\nunnecessary, because the Board’s notice\nof election, which must be posted by an\nemployer three working days before an\nelection takes place, contains a\nsummary of employee NLRA rights and\na list of several kinds of unfair labor\npractices, and failure to post that notice\nalready constitutes grounds for setting\nan election aside.171 In any event,\nduring a union organizing campaign, the\nunion can instruct members of its in-\nplant organizing committee to verify\nwhether the notice required under this\ntule has been posted; if it has not, the\nunion can so inform the employer and,\nif need be, the Board’s regional office.\n\nSubpart C—Ancillary Matters\n\nSeveral technical issues unrelated to\nthose discussed in the two previous\nsubparts are set out in this subpart.\n\nIV. Dissenting View of Member Brian E.\nHayes\n\n“Agencies may play the sorcerer’s\napprentice but not the sorcerer\nhimself.” 172\n\nToday, my colleagues conjure up a\nnew unfair labor practice based on a\nnew statutory obligation. They impose\non as many as six million private\nemployers the obligation to post a notice\nof employee rights and selected\nillustrative unfair labor practices. The\nobligation to post is deemed enforceable\nthrough Section 8(a)(1)’s proscription of\ninterference with employees’ Section 7\nrights, and the failure to post is further\npenalized by equitable tolling of Section\n10(b)’s limitations period and the\npossible inference of discriminatory\nmotivation for adverse employment\nactions taken in the absence of posting.\nWhile the need for a more informed\nconstituency might be a desirable goal,\nit is attainable only with Congressional\nimprimatur. The Board’s rulemaking\nauthority, broad as it is, does not\nencompass the authority to promulgate\na rule of this kind. Even if it did, the\naction taken here is arbitrary and\ncapricious, and therefore invalid,\nbecause it is not based on substantial\nevidence and it lacks a reasoned\nanalysis.\n\n171 See Section 103.20 of the Board’s Rules and\nRegulations.\n\n172 Alexander v. Sandoval, 532 U.S. 275, 291\n(2001).\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_022308\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

Employers subject to this\nrule are required to post the employee\nnotice to inform employees of their\nrights. Failure to post the employee\nnotice may be found to interfere with,\nrestrain, or coerce employees in the\nexercise of the rights guaranteed by\nNLRA Section 7, 29 U.S.C. 157, in\nviolation of NLRA Section 8(a)(1), 29\nU.S.C. 158(a)(1).\n\nNormally, the Board will determine\nwhether an employer is in compliance\nwhen a person files an unfair labor\npractice charge alleging that the\nemployer has failed to post the\nemployee notice required under this\npart. Filing a charge sets in motion the\nBoard’s procedures for investigating and\nadjudicating alleged unfair labor\n\npractices, and for remedying conduct\nthat the Board finds to be unlawful. See\nNLRA Sections 10-11, 29 U.S.C. 160—\n61, and 29 CFR part 102, subpart B.\n\n§ 104.211 What are the procedures for\nfiling a charge?\n\n(a) Filing charges. Any person (other\nthan Board personnel) may file a charge\nwith the Board alleging that an\nemployer has failed to post the\nemployee notice as required by this\npart. A charge should be filed with the\nRegional Director of the Region in\nwhich the alleged failure to post the\nrequired notice is occurring.\n\n(b) Contents of charges. The charge\nmust be in writing and signed, and must\nbe sworn to before a Board agent, notary\npublic, or other person authorized to\nadminister oaths or take\nacknowledgements, or contain a\ndeclaration by the person signing it,\nunder penalty of perjury, that its\ncontents are true and correct. The\ncharge must include:\n\n(1) The charging party’s full name and\naddress;\n\n(2) If the charge is filed by a union,\nthe full name and address of any\nnational or international union of which\nit is an affiliate or constituent unit;\n\n(3) The full name and address of the\nemployer alleged to have violated this\npart; and\n\n(4) A clear and concise statement of\nthe facts constituting the alleged unfair\nlabor practice.\n\n§ 104.212 What are the procedures to be\nfollowed when a charge is filed alleging that\nan employer has failed to post the required\nemployee notice?\n\n(a) When a charge is filed with the\nBoard under this section, the Regional\nDirector will investigate the allegations\nof the charge. If it appears that the\nallegations are true, the Regional\nDirector will make reasonable efforts to\npersuade the respondent employer to\npost the required employee notice\nexpeditiously. If the employer does so,\nthe Board expects that there will rarely\nbe a need for further administrative\nproceedings.\n\n(b) If an alleged violation cannot be\nresolved informally, the Regional\nDirector may issue a formal complaint\nagainst the respondent employer,\nalleging a violation of the notice-posting\nrequirement and scheduling a hearing\nbefore an administrative law judge.\nAfter a complaint issues, the matter will\nbe adjudicated in keeping with the\nBoard’s customary procedures. See\nNLRA Sections 10 and 11, 29 U.S.C.\n160, 161; 29 CFR part 102, subpart B.\n\n§ 104.213 What remedies are available to\ncure a failure to post the employee notice?\n\n(a) If the Board finds that the\nrespondent employer has failed to post\nthe required employee notices as\nalleged, the respondent will be ordered\nto cease and desist from the unlawful\nconduct and post the required employee\nnotice, as well as a remedial notice. In\nsome instances additional remedies may\nbe appropriately invoked in keeping\nwith the Board’s remedial authority.\n\n(b) Any employer that threatens or\nretaliates against an employee for filing\ncharges or testifying at a hearing\nconcerning alleged violations of the\nnotice-posting requirement may be\nfound to have committed an unfair labor\npractice. See NLRA Section 8(a)(1) and\n8(a)(4), 29 U.S.C. 158(a)(1), (4).\n\n§ 104.214 How might other Board\nproceedings be affected by failure to post\nthe employee notice?\n\n(a) Tolling of statute of limitations.\nWhen an employee files an unfair labor\npractice charge, the Board may find it\nappropriate to excuse the employee\nfrom the requirement that charges be\nfiled within six months after the\noccurrence of the allegedly unlawful\nconduct if the employer has failed to\npost the required employee notice\nunless the employee has received actual\nor constructive notice that the conduct\ncomplained of is unlawful. See NLRA\nSection 10(b), 29 U.S.C. 160(b).\n\n(b) Noncompliance as evidence of\nunlawful motive. The Board may\nconsider a knowing and willful refusal\nto comply with the requirement to post\nthe employee notice as evidence of\nunlawful motive in a case in which\nmotive is an issue.\n\nSubpart C—Ancillary Matters\n\n§ 104.220 What other provisions apply to\nthis part?\n\n(a) The regulations in this part do not\nmodify or affect the interpretation of\nany other NLRB regulations or policy.\n\n(b)(1) This subpart does not impair or\notherwise affect:\n\n(i) Authority granted by law toa\ndepartment, agency, or the head thereof;\nor\n\n(ii) Functions of the Director of the\nOffice of Management and Budget\nrelating to budgetary, administrative, or\nlegislative proposals.\n\n(2) This subpart must be implemented\nconsistent with applicable law and\nsubject to the availability of\nappropriations.\n\nc) This part creates no right or\nbenefit, substantive or procedural,\nenforceable at law or in equity by any\nparty against the United States, its\ndepartments, agencies, or entities, its\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_022320\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

The second law also casts humanity in the role of slavemaster, a situation which\nhistory shows leads to moral degradation.\n\nUnlike Asimov in his fiction, we consider it critical that AGI ethics be construed to encompass\nboth “human ethicalness to AGIs” and “AGI ethicalness to humans.” The multiple-imperatives\napproach we explore here suggests that, in many contexts, these two aspects of AGI ethics may\nbe best addressed jointly.\n\nThe issue of ethicalness to AGIs has not been entirely avoided in the literature, however.\nWallach [WA10] considers it in some detail; and Thomas Metzinger (in the final chapter of\n[Met04]) has argued that creating AGI is in itself an unethical pursuit, because early-stage\nAGIs will inevitably be badly-built, so that their subjective experiences will quite possibly be\nextremely unpleasant in ways we can’t understand or predict. Our view is that this is a serious\nconcern, which however is most probably avoidable via appropriate AGI designs and teaching\nmethodologies. To address Metzinger’s concern one must create AGIs that, right from the start,\nare adept at communicating their states of minds in a way we can understand both analytically\nand empathically. There is no reason to believe this is impossible, but, it certainly constitutes\na large constraint on the class of AGI architectures to be pursued. On the other hand, there is\nan argument that this sort of AGI architecture will also be the easiest one to create, because it\nwill be the easiest kind for humans to instruct.\n\nAnd this leads on to a topic that is central to our work with CogPrime in several respects:\nimitative learning. The way humans achieve empathic interconnection is in large part via being\nwired for imitation. When we perceive another human carrying out an action, mirror neuron\nsystems in our brains respond in many cases as if we ourselves were carrying out the action (see\n[Per70, Per81] and Appendix ??). This obviously primes us for carrying out the same actions\nourselves later on: i.e., the capability and inclination for imitative learning is explicitly encoded\nin our brains. Given the efficiency of imitative learning as a means of acquiring knowledge, it\nseems extremely likely that any successful early-stage AGIs are going to utilize this methodology\nas well. CogPrime utilizes imitative learning as a key aspect. Thus, at least some current AGI\nwork is occurring in a manner that would plausibly circumvent Metzinger’s ethical complaint.\n\nObviously, the use of imitative learning in AGI systems has further specific implications for\nAGI ethics. It means that (much as in the case of interaction with other humans) what we do\nto and around AGIs has direct implications for their behavior and their well-being. We suggest\nthat among early-stage AGI’s capable of imitative learning, one of the most likely sources\nfor AGI misbehavior is imitative learning of antisocial behavior from human companions. “Do\nas I say, not as I do” may have even more dire consequences as an approach to AGI ethics\npedagogy than the already serious repercussions it has when teaching humans.

Bullet-headed and\naggressive in stance, he said a lot of valuable things -- particularly about how men ought\nto take ownership of problems we traditionally consider \"women's issues.\" It's certainly\ntrue that if we want to end male abuse of women, men must participate in the movement.\nBut although Katz discussed some issues of masculinity, I heard little about how we can\nmake things better for men. His proposition of a men's movement was centered around\ncorrecting the things some men are doing wrong.\n\nAlthough they're often watered down, many feminist concepts have gone mainstream.\nFor instance, Americans have some consciousness of traditional feminist critiques about\nhow women's bodies are represented in the media. Indeed, that consciousness has become\nso endemic that, in a grandly ironic twist, marketers now capitalize on it to sell beauty\nproducts: the nationwide Dove Campaign for Real Beauty attempts to use\ndeconstruction of the media's representation of women to sell Dove soap. Americans\nare also quite aware of men as the privileged class -- sometimes regarded outright as the\noppressors.\n\nBut this shift in awareness about gender issues faced by women has not been\naccompanied by a widespread understanding of gender issues faced by men. And that\ncreates situations like an activist working towards a masculinity movement that talks\nmainly about how men are hurting women, or a trans man who has trouble with the idea\nof transitioning partly because he doesn't want to be a white man -- one of the oppressors.\n\nHow can awareness of oppressive dynamics make it difficult for men to own their\nmasculinity? Does male privilege ever make life harder for men? When does male\nprivilege blind us to oppression of masculinity? There's some mainstream awareness of\ngender issues faced by women; is there any similar awareness of the problems of\nmasculinity?\n\nA good friend of mine first caught my attention by talking about gender. We encountered\neach other ata BDSM meetup, and when I mentioned that I'd been thinking about the\nboxes around masculine sexuality, he launched into a rant about oppressive sexual\ndynamics. He gave me references to complex sexuality blogs and intelligently used\nwords like \"heteronormative\" and \"patriarchy.\" But a month or so after we started talking,\nI mentioned his interest in gender issues... and he gave me a puzzled look. \"I'm not really\ninto gender studies,” he said.\n\nHe talks about sex, gender and culture all the time -- but he also specifically identifies as\nhighly masculine, and felt that to be at odds with identifying as someone who questions\nmasculinity. As Thomas Millar writes in his aforementioned article: \"There's a huge\nunstated assumption that to even address the question [of male sexuality], for men, is to\nmark one's self as ‘other.’ ... cis het men are brought up to fear that their masculinity could\never be called into question. By even opening up a dialog, I think some folks fear that\nthey are conceding that their sexuality is not uncontroversial.”\n\nMen currently experience this problem in a way that women do not. In other words,\nwomen don't risk being seen as unfeminine as easily as men risk being seen as\nunmasculine; nor do we have quite the same fears about it. In 2008, a group of\nresearchers published a paper called \"Precarious Manhood.” Their concluding statement:\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_018576\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

However, when it comes to understanding the human\nmind, these two goals—accuracy and generalizability—have long been at odds with each\nother.\n\nAt the far extreme of generalizability are rational theories of cognition. These\ntheories describe human behavior as a rational response to a given situation. A rational\nactor strives to maximize the expected reward produced by a sequence of actions—an\nidea widely used in economics precisely because it produces such generalizable\npredictions about human behavior. For the same reason, rationality is the standard\nassumption in inverse-reinforcement-learning models that try to make inferences from\nhuman behavior—perhaps with the concession that humans are not perfectly rational\nagents and sometimes randomly choose to act in ways unaligned with or even opposed to\ntheir best interests.\n\nThe problem with rationality as a basis for modeling human cognition 1s that it is\nnot accurate. In the domain of decision making, an extensive literature—spearheaded by\nthe work of cognitive psychologists Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky—has\ndocumented the ways in which people deviate from the prescriptions of rational models.\nKahneman and Tversky proposed that in many situations people instead follow simple\nheuristics that allow them to reach good solutions at low cognitive cost but sometimes\nresult in errors. To take one of their examples, if you ask somebody to evaluate the\nprobability of an event, they might rely on how easy it is to generate an example of such\nan event from memory, consider whether they can come up with a causal story for that\nevent’s occurring, or assess how similar the event is to their expectations. Each heuristic\nis a reasonable strategy for avoiding complex probabilistic computations, but also results\nin errors. For instance, relying on the ease of generating an event from memory as a\nguide to its probability leads us to overestimate the chances of extreme (hence extremely\nmemorable) events such as terrorist attacks.\n\nHeuristics provide a more accurate model of human cognition but one that is not\neasily generalizable. How do we know which heuristic people might use in a particular\nsituation? Are there other heuristics they use that we just haven’t discovered yet?\nKnowing exactly how people will behave in a new situation is a challenge: Is this\nsituation one in which they would generate examples from memory, come up with causal\nstories, or rely on similarity?\n\nUltimately, what we need is a way to describe how human minds work that has\nthe generalizability of rationality and the accuracy of heuristics. One way to achieve this\ngoal is to start with rationality and consider how to take it in a more realistic direction. A\nproblem with using rationality as a basis for describing the behavior of any real-world\nagent is that, in many situations, calculating the rational action requires the agent to\npossess a huge amount of computational resources. It might be worth expending those\nresources 1f you’re making a highly consequential decision and have a lot of time to\nevaluate your options, but most human decisions are made quickly and for relatively low\nstakes. In any situation where the time you spend making a decision is costly—at the\nvery least because it’s time you could spend doing something else—the classic notion of\nrationality is no longer a good prescription for how one should behave.\n\nTo develop a more realistic model of rational behavior, we need to take into\n\n94\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_016314\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

Ifa particularly inappropriate expression that had not been included in the\ncodification were then to be used, the committee could consider including it for future discipline,\nbut it could not be the basis for imposing discipline for speech that took place prior to its\ninclusion in the codification.\n\nThe virtue of a code is that it completely occupies the area of sanctions. It leaves no room for\n“common law crimes” or broad decanal discretion. The vice of a code is that it is often\nunderinclusive—it excludes conduct (or, in this case, speech) that is novel, or that was not\nconsidered by the codifiers. In the area of freedom of expression, the virtue of such a limitation\ntrumps its vice, at least in my view. It is far better to have rules regulating speech that are\nunderinclusive than overinclusive.\n\nIn 2007, I taught a university-wide course with Professor Steven Pinker on the issue of Taboo.\nThe question posed by the course was whether there are any issues that are so delicate, sensitive,\ncontroversial, or disgusting that they should be treated as “taboos,” even on a university campus\ndedicated to open dialogue and the free exchange of views. Most Americans are brought up to\nbelieve in freedom of expression, but almost everyone has at least one type of speech that he/she\nwould suppress. In our course, we searched for a theory of taboo — a description or prescription\nof genres of expression that lay outside the presumption of discussability and are, or should be,\nsubject to suppression, censorship or tabooization. Professor Pinker presented some evolutionary\nand psychological arguments for the existence and utility of some taboos, while questioning many\nof the taboos that currently seem to exist on university campuses. I discussed the legal and moral\narguments for and against any exceptions to the general presumption of free expression. In the\nend, there was little agreement, except that there is and should be a difference between societal\ntaboos, enforceable only by social sanction, and official governmental censorship, enforceable by\nthe power of the state through the law.\n\nWe also agreed that notwithstanding the clear words of the First Amendment, Congress must\nhave the power to make some laws banning the disclosure of some secrets for some time. Finally,\nwe agreed that there will never be a perfect balance struck between the public’s need to know and\nthe government’s need to keep our enemies from knowing certain information. The struggle to\nstrike this delicate balance never stays won. What history seems to teach us is generally to err on\nthe side of more disclosure rather than more censorship, even when it comes to national security.\n\n131\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_017218\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

Yet that has not happened, because democratic governments (even the current\nAmerican administration, with its flagrantly antidemocratic impulses) lack the will and\nthe means to enforce such surveillance on an obstreperous people accustomed to saying\nwhat they want. Occasionally, warnings of nuclear, biological, or cyberterrorism goad\ngovernment security agencies into measures such as hoovering up mobile phone\nmetadata, but these ineffectual measures, more theater than oppression, have had no\nsignificant effect on either security or freedom. Ironically, tech prophecy plays a role in\nencouraging these measures. By sowing panic about supposed existential threats such as\nsuitcase nuclear bombs and bioweapons assembled in teenagers’ bedrooms, they put\npressure on governments to prove they’re doing something, anything, to protect the\nAmerican people.\n\nIt’s not that political freedom takes care of itself. It’s that the biggest threats lie in\nthe networks of ideas, norms, and institutions that allow information to feed back (or not)\non collective decisions and understanding. As opposed to the chimerical technological\nthreats, one real threat today is oppressive political correctness, which has choked the\nrange of publicly expressible hypotheses, terrified many intelligent people against\nentering the intellectual arena, and triggered a reactionary backlash. Another real threat\nis the combination of prosecutorial discretion with an expansive lawbook filled with\nvague statutes. The result is that every American unwittingly commits “three felonies a\nday” (as the title of a book by civil libertarian Harvey Silverglate puts it) and is in\njeopardy of imprisonment whenever it suits the government’s needs. It’s this\nprosecutorial weaponry that makes Big Brother all-powerful, not telescreens. The\nactivism and polemicizing directed against government surveillance programs would be\nbetter directed at its overweening legal powers.\n\nThe other focus of much tech prophecy today is artificial intelligence, whether in\nthe original sci-fi dystopia of computers running amok and enslaving us in an\nunstoppable quest for domination, or the newer version in which they subjugate us by\naccident, single-mindedly seeking some goal we give them regardless of its side effects\non human welfare (the value-alignment problem adumbrated by Wiener). Here again\nboth threats strike me as chimerical, growing from a narrow technological determinism\nthat neglects the networks of information and control in an intelligent system like a\ncomputer or brain and in a society as a whole.\n\nThe subjugation fear is based on a muzzy conception of intelligence that owes\nmore to the Great Chain of Being and a Nietzschean will to power than to a Wienerian\nanalysis of intelligence and purpose in terms of information, computation, and control. In\nthese horror scenarios, intelligence is portrayed as an all-powerful, wish-granting potion\nthat agents possess in different amounts. Humans have more of it than animals, and an\nartificially intelligent computer or robot will have more of it than humans. Since we\nhumans have used our moderate endowment to domesticate or exterminate less well-\nendowed animals (and since technologically advanced societies have enslaved or\nannihilated technologically primitive ones), it follows that a supersmart AI would do the\nsame to us.

People don't just go to community dungeons to do S&M -- they\nalso go to community dungeons for discussion groups or educational workshops, to learn\nhow to perform certain activities safely.\n\nMuch like Jane, the S&M community has also created a network of necessary references:\nthe Kink Aware Professionals list. If you've read my work before, you've probably read\nabout this list, because it had a huge impact on my life and I like to spread the word.\nS&M activists in San Francisco realized, years ago, that there was a need for lawyers and\ndoctors who understood their lives and wouldn't stigmatize their choices, so they wrote\nthree names on a piece of paper and passed it around. Now, the Kink Aware\nProfessionals list is an international online directory hosted by the nonprofit National\nCoalition for Sexual Freedom.\n\nAgain, it's not like there are no problems in the S&M community; people gossip, people\nbackstab, people fuck up. There's little vetting process for educators or for people who\nlist themselves on Kink Aware Professionals, and a lot of people run kink classes at least\nas much from a desire for status as from a desire to educate. But still, I think the S&M\ncommunity is engaging in positive activism... more than a lot of us even realize.\n\nThis was a lesson that really hit home for me when I spent a year in Africa working on\nHIV mitigation. One of the reasons international aid is so complicated is that figuring out\nhow to help a community that's not yours is incredibly hard. A lot of well-meaning\nAmericans (including myself) go abroad with little understanding of how hard it is. The\nreality is that assisting with, for example, public health in a foreign place entails learning\nthe social fabric of that country in a way that outsiders can only do with tons of sustained\neffort... and we're still unlikely to be as good as someone who grew up there. One of the\nreasons -- maybe the biggest reason -- I left was that it was so obvious to me that I was a\nbetter activist in the USA... even when I wasn't trying to do activism. (When I was there,\nI received one letter from an American girl asking for advice on how to do African\nactivism. My advice to her can be summarized as, \"It's harder than you think, and you\nmight consider staying home where you're awesomer.\")\n\nWhen HIV began destroying the gay community, the most effective and important\nmeasures to curb it came from people like Richard Berkowitz, the actual gay activist who\nwrote a safer sex pamphlet on his home typewriter and then distributed it by hand. They\nsaw a need and they did something about it. Just like Jane. Just like S&M educators.\n\nYou are probably already part of more communities than you might realize. If you go to a\nuniversity, you're part of that community.

However, whether there is\ntime for such revision to occur before AGI at the human level or above is created, depends on\nhow fast is our progress toward AGI. What one wants is for progress to be slow enough that,\nat each stage of intelligence advance, concepts such as those discussed in this paper can be\nre-evaluated and re-analyzed in the light of the data gathered, and AGI designs and approaches\ncan be revised accordingly as necessary.\n\nHowever, due to the nature of modern technology development, it seems extremely unlikely\nthat AGI development is going to be artificially slowed down in order to enable measured\ndevelopment of accompanying ethical tools, practices and understandings. For example, if one\nnation chose to enforce such a slowdown as a matter of policy (speaking about a future date\nat which substantial AGI progress has already been demonstrated, so that international AGI\nfunding is dramatically increased from present levels), the odds seem very high that other\nnations would explicitly seek to accelerate their own progress on AGI, so as to reap the ensuing\ndifferential economic benefits (the example of stem cells arises again).\n\nAnd this leads on to our next and final point regarding strategy for biasing AGI toward\nFriendliness...\n\n12.10.2 Develop Advanced AGI Sooner Not Later\n\nSomewhat ironically, it seems the best way to ensure that AGI development proceeds at a rel-\natively measured pace is to initiate serious AGI development sooner rather than later. This is\nbecause the same AGI concepts will meet slower practical development today than 10 years\nfrom now, and slower 10 years from now than 20 years from now, etc. — due to the ongoing\nrapid advancement of various tools related to AGI development, such as computer hardware,\nprogramming languages, and computer science algorithms; and also the ongoing global advance-\nment of education which makes it increasingly cost-effective to recruit suitably knowledgeable\nAI developers.\n\nCurrently the pace of AGI progress is sufficiently slow that practical work is in no danger\nof outpacing associated ethical theorizing. However, if we want to avoid the future occurrence\nof this sort of dangerous outpacing, our best practical choice is to make sure more substantial\nAGI development occurs in the phase before the development of tools that will make AGI\ndevelopment extraordinarily rapid. Of course, the authors are doing their best in this direction\nvia their work on the CogPrime project!\n\nFurthermore, this point bears connecting with the need, raised above, to foster the devel-\nopment of Global Brain technologies capable to \"Foster Deep, Consensus-Building Interactions\nBetween People with Divergent Views.\" If this sort of technology is to be maximally valuable,\nit should be created quickly enough that we can use it to help shape the goal system content of\nthe first highly powerful AGIs. So, to simplify just a bit: We really want both deep-sharing GB\ntechnology and AGI technology to evolve relatively rapidly, compared to computing hardware\nand advanced CS algorithms (since the latter factors will be the main drivers behind the ac-\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_013157\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

The Chinese Institute of Contemporary\nInternational Relations and the University of International Relations, both of which\nhave links to the Ministry of State Security (MSS), host conferences on US-China\nrelations and/or Track 2 dialogues. So do the Foreign Ministry—affiliated China\nInstitute of International Studies, Chinese People’s Institute for Foreign Affairs,\n\nand the China Foreign Affairs University. The Charhar Institute is also involved\n\nin such activities, although its institutional linkages are unclear.\n\nMore recently, Chinese think tanks professing to be independent from direct\ngovernment control have begun to actively engage US counterparts. The think-tank\nIntellisia is one such organization that has sponsored dialogues with US scholars. The\nCenter for China and Globalization is another such “independent” think tank, with\nmore than a hundred researchers and staff. According to several think-tank analysts,\nits founder and head, Wang Huiyao, actively solicits invitations to speak in US think-\ntank settings. In May 2018, however, Senator Marco Rubio publicly questioned why\nWang’s CCP affiliations—most particularly his work with the CCP’s United Front Work\nDepartment as a standing director of the China Overseas Friendship Association—\nwere not mentioned as part of his biography in an invitation to an upcoming event at\na DC-based think tank. Despite the fact that the think tank planned to acknowledge\nWang’s position during the panel presentation, given the ensuing public scrutiny,\nWang dropped out of the event. He later appeared, however, at another US think-tank\nevent without his government affiliation noted and without provoking attention from\nany member of Congress. For such “independent” Chinese think tanks, organizing\nconferences can give them a significant boost in prestige at home. One Chinese\nthink-tank director informed an American think-tank analyst that he received several\nhundred thousand dollars from the university’s party secretary as a bonus for bringing\nsuch a prestigious delegation of Western China watchers to China.\n\nFinally, a group of several senior Chinese government officials and think-tank scholars\nfrom different institutions has emerged as an important generator of China-US think\ntank cooperation. This group includes such well-known figures as Fu Ying (director of\nthe NPC’s Foreign Affairs Committee), Wang Jisi (director of Peking University’s Institute\nof International and Strategic Studies), Yuan Peng (president of CICIR), and Wang Wen\n(executive dean of the Chongyang Institute for Financial Studies at Renmin University),\nwho are all well funded and able to pay for the activities of the Chinese side, as well as\ntravel and hotel stays for Americans who participate in their projects in China.\n\nFu Ying emerges as the senior figure in a growing number of US-China interactions.\nAccording to several think-tank analysts, she works hard to structure projects in ways\nto ensure the best possible outcome from the Chinese perspective.

During a visit to\nBahrain, Secretary of Defense Robert Gates urged the government to\nadopt genuine political and social reform.\n\nBut to the Saudis, the rising disorder on their borders fit a pattern of\nIranian meddling. A year earlier, they were convinced that Iran was\nstoking a rebellion in Yemen's north among a Shiite-dominated rebel\ngroup known as the Houthis. Few outside observers saw extensive\nties between Iran and the Houthis. But the Saudis nonetheless viewed\nthe nationwide Yemeni protests in that context. In Bahrain, where\nmany Shiites openly nurture cultural and religious ties to Iran, the\nSaudis saw the case as even more open-and-shut.

Today, life expectancy has increased by leaps and bounds\nvirtually everywhere. Infant and maternal mortality have dropped sharply,\nthanks in part to the spread of clear hygiene standards and the construction\nof modern hospitals. According to the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, as\nrecently as 1988, polio was rampant in 125 countries; today that number is\ndown to two. Aside from among the Taliban and a few pockets of upscale\ncommunities in the United States, the virtues of vaccines are accepted by all,\npart of a general consensus on the virtues of Western science and\ntechnology.\n\nAnd reason is replacing superstition more generally. People around the\nworld now routinely do basic cost-benefit analyses when looking for\nsolutions to problems, leading to a gradual improvement in outcomes\neverywhere, from agriculture and construction to social and political life.\nThis helps explain the dramatic long-term decline in the rates of most kinds\nof conflict and violence that the Harvard scholar Steven Pinker has\ndocumented.\n\nAfter slavery and imprisonment, the most degrading condition a human\nbeing can experience is poverty. In 2000, UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan\nannounced as one of the ambitious Millennium Development Goals halving\nextreme global poverty by 2015. That goal was far exceeded, and the U.S.\nNational Intelligence Council has predicted that extreme poverty will be\nreduced even further by 2030-which would constitute one of the most\nremarkable developments in human history. The global middle class,\nmeanwhile, is projected to rise from 1.8 billion in 2009 to 3.2 billion in\n2020 and 4.9 billion in 2030. The world's infant mortality rate decreased\nfrom an estimated 63 deaths per 1,000 live births in 1990 to 32 in 2015. This\ntranslates into more than four million fewer infant deaths each year.\n\nInstead of optimism based on this recent progress, however, these days in\nthe West, one more often encounters pessimism related to three current\nchallenges: turbulence in the Islamic world, the rise of China, and intra-\nWestern economic and political sclerosis. But the pessimism is\nunwarranted, because none of these three challenges is insurmountable.\n\nMODERNIZING MUSLIMS\n\nThe Islamic world, from Morocco to Indonesia, comprises 1.6 billion\ncitizens-more than one in five people on the planet. The vast majority of\nthem share the common global aspirations to modernize their societies,\nachieve middle-class living standards, and lead peaceful, productive, and\nfulfilling lives.\n\nContrary to what some assert, Islam is fully compatible with modernization.\nWhen Malaysia built the Petronas Towers and Dubai built Burj Khalifa, they\nwere not just erecting physical structures but also sending a metaphysical\nmessage: we want to be part of the modern world in all dimensions. Many\nIslamic societies have educated their women.

Beneficial stockholders should contact their broker, trustee, or nominee for instructions on how to change their proxy\nRegisteredStockholders. Registered stockholders may change a properly executed proxy at any time before its exercise by\n1. delivering written notice of revocation to the general counsel and secretary at our principal executive offices at 1930 W.

The affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast by the shares of common stock present in person or represented by\nproxy at the meeting and entitled to vote thereon is required to approve all other items. Abstentions will be counted as present and entitled to vote on the\nproposal and will therefore have the effect of a negative vote. We do not expect there to be any broker non-votes with respect to any of the proposals.\n- 3 -\nTable of Contents\nQ: When will the results of the vote be announced?\nThe preliminary voting results will be announced at the annual meeting.

Our certificate of incorporation\nprovides that the authorized number of directors may be changed only by resolution of our Board. Our certificate also provides that our Board will be\ndivided into three classes of directors, with the classes as nearly equal in number as possible. At each annual meeting of stockholders, a class of directors\nwill be elected for a three-year term to succeed the class whose term is then expiring.\ndirectors:\nThe following table sets forth the director class, name, age as of April 23, 2019, and other information for each member of our board of\nCURRENT\nTERM\nEXPIRES\nEXPIRATION\nOF TERM\nFOR WHICH\nNOMINATED\nNAME CLASS AGE POSITION\nDIRECTOR\nSINCE\nGregory Sullivan II 60 Director 2017 2019 2022\nDan Quayle II 72 Director 2017 2019 2022\nMichael Maroone III 65 Lead Director 2017 2020\nErnest Garcia III I 36 President, CEO and Chairman 2017 2021\nIra Platt I 55 Director 2017 2021\nWe believe that in order for our Board to effectively guide us to long-term sustainable, dependable performance, it should be composed of\nindividuals with sophistication and experience in the many disciplines that impact our business. To best serve our stockholders, we seek to have a board\nthat, as a whole, is competent in key corporate disciplines, including accounting and financial acumen, business judgment, crisis management, governance,\nleadership, people management, risk management, social responsibility and reputational issues, and strategy and strategic planning. Additionally, the Board\ndesires to have specific knowledge related to our industry, such as expertise in automotive retail and consumer finance.\nThe Compensation and Nominating Committee believes that all directors must, at a minimum, meet the criteria set forth in the Board’s code of\nconduct and the corporate governance guidelines, which specify, among other things, that the Compensation and Nominating Committee will consider\ncriteria such as independence, diversity, age, skills, and experience in the context of the needs of the Board. In addressing issues of diversity in particular,\nthe Compensation and Nominating Committee considers a nominee’s differences in viewpoint, professional experience, background, education, skill, age,\nrace, gender, and national origin. The Compensation and Nominating Committee believes that diversity of backgrounds and viewpoints is a key attribute for\na director nominee. Accordingly, to improve director diversity and best serve our stockholders, the Compensation and Nominating Committee adopted a\npolicy in 2019 to request that any search firm that it engages include women and minority candidates in the initial list from which the committee selects\ndirector candidates. The Compensation and Nominating Committee also will consider a combination of factors for each director, including whether the\nnominee possesses:\n- 5 -\nTable of Contents\n• the ability to represent all stockholders without a conflict of interest;\n• the ability to work in and promote a productive environment;\n• sufficient time and willingness to fulfill the substantial duties and responsibilities of a director;\n• the high level of character and integrity that we expect;\n• broad professional and leadership experience and skills necessary to effectively respond to the complex issues encountered by a national,\npublicly traded company; and\n• the ability to apply sound and independent business judgment.\nThe Compensation and Nominating Committee has determined that all of our directors meet the criteria and qualifications set forth in the code\nof conduct for the Board of Directors, the corporate governance guidelines and the criteria set forth above for director nominees. Moreover, each director\npossesses the following critical personal qualities and attributes that we believe are essential for the proper functioning of the Board to allow it to fulfill its\nduties for our stockholders: accountability, ethical leadership, governance, integrity, risk management, and sound business judgment. In addition, our\ndirectors have the mature confidence to assess and challenge the way things are done and recommend alternative solutions, a keen awareness of our\nbusiness and the social realities of the environment in which we operate, the independence and high-performance standards necessary to fulfill the Board’s\noversight function, and the humility, professional maturity, and style to interface openly and constructively with other directors. Finally, the director\nbiographies below include a non-exclusive list of other key experiences and qualifications that further qualify the individual to serve on the Board. These\ncollective qualities, skills, experiences, and attributes are essential to our Board’s ability to exercise its oversight function for Carvana and its stockholders\nand to guide the long-term sustainable, dependable performance of our business.\nSubject to any earlier resignation or removal in accordance with the terms of our certificate and bylaws, our Class II directors will serve until\nthis our second annual meeting of stockholders, our Class III directors will serve until the third annual meeting of stockholders, and our Class I directors\nwill serve until our fourth annual meeting of stockholders. In addition, our certificate provides that our directors may be removed with or without cause by\nthe affirmative vote of at least a majority of the voting power of our outstanding shares of stock entitled to vote thereon, voting together as a single class, for\nso long as the Garcia Parties are entitled to ten votes for each share of Class B common stock they hold. If the Garcia Parties are no longer entitled to ten\nvotes for each share of Class B common stock they hold, then our directors may be removed only for cause upon the affirmative vote of at least 66 2 ⁄ 3 % of\nthe voting power of our outstanding shares of stock entitled to vote thereon.\n- 6 -\nTable of Contents\nThe Compensation and Nominating Committee will consider stockholder nominations for membership on the Board. For the 2020 Annual\nMeeting, nominations may be submitted to Carvana Co., 1930 W. Rio Salado Pkwy, Tempe, AZ 85281, Attn: Secretary, who will forward them to the\nChairman of the Compensation and Nominating Committee. Recommendations must be in writing and we must receive the recommendation no later than\nthe close of business on January 24, 2020, and not earlier than the close of business on December 25, 2019. Recommendations must also include certain\nother requirements specified in our bylaws. The committee will apply the same criteria to the evaluation of those candidates as it applies to other director\ncandidates.\nWhen filling a vacancy on the Board, the Compensation and Nominating Committee identifies the desired skills and experience of a new\ndirector and nominates individuals who it believes can strengthen the Board’s capabilities and further diversify the collective experience represented by the\nthen-current directors. The Compensation and Nominating Committee may engage third parties to assist in the search and provide recommendations.\nPursuant to a previously informal policy formally adopted in 2019, any search firm that the committee engages is requested to include women and minority\ncandidates in the initial list from which the committee selects director candidates. Also, directors are generally asked to recommend candidates for the\nposition. The candidates would be evaluated based on the process outlined in the Corporate Governance Guidelines and the Compensation and Nominating\nCommittee charter, and the same process would be used for all candidates, including candidates recommended by stockholders.\n- 7 -\nTable of Contents\nITEM 1—ELECTION OF DIRECTORS\nOur Board recommends that the nominees below be elected as members of the Board at the annual meeting to serve for a three-year term\nexpiring at the 2022 Annual Meeting.\nNAME AGE\nDIRECTOR\nSINCE POSITION\nGregory Sullivan 60 2017 Director\nDan Quayle 72 2017 Director\nEach nominee was recommended for re-election by the Compensation and Nominating Committee for consideration by the Board and proposal\nto our stockholders.

We believe that Mr. Platt will continue to be a valuable member of our Board because of his service on\nDriveTime’s board and his extensive experience in consumer finance and the automotive retail industry.\nMichael Maroone has served on our Board since the completion of our IPO. Mr. Maroone is currently the CEO of Maroone U.S.A. LLC. From\nJuly 2005 to April 2015, Mr. Maroone served on the board of AutoNation, Inc., an automotive retailer and provider of new and used vehicles and related\nservices.

In making this determination, our Board considered the relationships that each non-employee director has\nwith Carvana and all other facts and circumstances that our Board deemed relevant in determining their independence, including beneficial ownership of\nour Class A common stock.\nCONTROLLED COMPANY STATUS\nFor purposes of the corporate governance rules of the NYSE, we are a “controlled company.” Controlled companies under those rules are\ncompanies of which more than 50% of the voting power for the election of directors is held by an individual, a group, or another company. The Garcia\nParties beneficially own more than 50% of the combined voting power of Carvana Co. Accordingly, we expect to be eligible for, but do not currently intend\nto take advantage of, certain exemptions from the corporate governance requirements of the NYSE. Specifically, as a “controlled company,” we would not\nbe required to have:\n• a majority of independent directors,\n• a nominating and corporate governance committee composed entirely of independent directors with a written charter addressing the\ncommittee’s purpose and responsibilities,\n• a compensation committee composed entirely of independent directors with a written charter addressing the committee’s purpose and\nresponsibilities, or\n• an annual performance evaluation of the nominating and governance and compensation committees.\n- 10 -\nTable of Contents\nIn the event we choose to rely on some or all of these exemptions in the future, you would not have the same protections afforded to stockholders of\ncompanies that are subject to all of the applicable corporate governance rules of the NYSE.\nBOARD MEETINGS AND COMMITTEES\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, our Board held five meetings, our Audit Committee held nine meetings, and our Compensation and\nNominating Committee held four meetings. Directors are expected to attend the annual meeting of stockholders and all or substantially all of the Board\nmeetings and meetings of committees on which they serve, and to spend the time needed and meet as frequently as necessary to properly discharge their\nresponsibilities. Each director attended last year’s annual meeting, 100% of the meetings of the Board during such director’s tenure, and 100% of the\nmeetings held by the committees of the Board on which the director served.\nOur Board has an Audit Committee and a Compensation and Nominating Committee. The composition, duties and responsibilities of these\ncommittees are as set forth below. In the future, our board may establish other committees, as it deems appropriate, to assist it with its responsibilities.\nCOMPENSATION\nAND\nBOARD MEMBER\nAUDIT\nCOMMITTEE\nNOMINATING\nCOMMITTEE\nIra Platt • •\nGregory Sullivan • •\nDan Quayle •\nMichael Maroone •\nAUDITCOMMITTEE\nThe Audit Committee is responsible for, among other matters,\n• appointing, compensating, retaining, evaluating, terminating, and overseeing our independent registered public accounting firm;\n• discussing with our independent registered public accounting firm their independence from management;\n• reviewing with our independent registered public accounting firm the scope and results of their audit;\n• approving all audit and permissible non-audit services to be performed by our independent registered public accounting firm;\n• overseeing the financial reporting process and discussing with management and our independent registered public accounting firm the interim\nand annual financial statements that we file with the SEC;\n- 11 -\nTable of Contents\n• reviewing and monitoring our accounting principles, accounting policies, financial and accounting controls, and compliance with legal and\nregulatory requirements;\n• establishing procedures for the confidential anonymous submission of concerns regarding questionable accounting, internal controls, or auditing\nmatters;\n• reviewing and approving related party transactions; and\n• overseeing our enterprise risk management program.\nOur Board has affirmatively determined that Mr. Platt, Mr. Maroone, and Mr. Sullivan meet the definition of “independent director” for\npurposes of serving on an Audit Committee under Rule 10A-3 of the Exchange Act and the NYSE rules. In addition, our Board has determined that\nMr. Platt qualifies as an “audit committee financial expert,” as such term is defined in Item 407(d)(5) of Regulation S-K. The written charter for our Audit\nCommittee is available at our corporate website at investors.carvana.com/corporate-governance/governance-documents.\nCOMPENSATIONANDNOMINATINGCOMMITTEE\nThe Compensation and Nominating Committee is responsible for, among other matters,\n• reviewing key employee compensation goals, policies, plans, and programs;\n• reviewing and providing recommendations to the Board regarding the compensation of our directors, chief executive officer, and other\nexecutive officers;\n• reviewing and approving employment agreements and other similar arrangements between us and our executive officers;\n• administering stock plans and other incentive compensation plans;\n• identifying individuals qualified to become members of our Board, consistent with criteria approved by our Board;\n• overseeing the organization of our Board to discharge the Board’s duties and responsibilities properly and efficiently;\n• identifying best practices and recommending corporate governance principles; and\n• developing and recommending to our Board a set of corporate governance guidelines and principles applicable to us.\nThe Board has adopted a written charter for the Compensation and Nominating Committee, which is available on our corporate website at\ninvestors.carvana.com/corporate-governance/governance-documents. Each member of our Compensation and Nominating Committee is an independent\ndirector as defined by NYSE rules.\n- 12 -\nTable of Contents\nBOARD LEADERSHIP STRUCTURE\nThe following section describes our board leadership structure, the reasons why the structure is in place at this time, the roles of various\npositions, and related key governance practices. The mix of experienced independent and management directors that make up our Board, along with the\nindependent role of our lead director and our independent board-committee composition, benefits Carvana and its stockholders.\nINDEPENDENCE;BOARDMIX\nOur Board has an effective mix of independent and management directors. It is composed of four independent directors and our current\nchairman and chief executive officer, Ernest Garcia III.\nLEADDIRECTOR\nThe Board believes that it is beneficial to Carvana and its stockholders to designate one of the directors as a lead director who is elected by a\nmajority of the Board. The lead director serves a variety of roles, including reviewing and approving Board schedules to confirm the appropriate board and\ncommittee topics are reviewed and sufficient time is allocated to each; liaising between our chairman and chief executive officer and non-management\ndirectors when necessary and appropriate (that said, each director has direct and regular access to the chairman and chief executive officer) and calling an\nexecutive session of independent directors at any time consistent with the bylaws and certificate of incorporation. Michael Maroone, an independent\ndirector and member of our Audit Committee, is currently our lead director. Mr. Maroone is an effective lead director for Carvana due to, among other\nthings, his independence, his board leadership experience with AutoNation, Inc., his strong strategic and financial acumen, his commitment to ethics, his\nextensive knowledge of the automotive retail environment, and his deep understanding of Carvana and its business.\nCHAIRMAN/CEO\nWith respect to the roles of chairman and CEO, the corporate governance guidelines provide that the roles may be separated or combined, and\nthe Board will exercise its discretion in combining or separating these positions as it deems appropriate in light of prevailing circumstances. Mr. Garcia has\nbeen our chairman and CEO since our IPO. The Board believes that combining the roles of chairman and CEO, together with the separate, independent role\nof our lead director, is currently the most effective leadership structure because Mr. Garcia has extensive knowledge and experience in a variety of relevant\nareas acquired through his professional and other experiences, including automotive retail, e-commerce, consumer finance and strategic planning. This\nknowledge and experience give Mr. Garcia the insight necessary to combine the responsibilities of strategic development and execution along with\nmanagement of day-to-day operations.\n- 13 -\nTable of Contents\nSELF-EVALUATION\nOur Compensation and Nominating Committee conducts an annual performance evaluation to determine whether the Board, its committees,\nand the directors are functioning effectively. This includes survey materials as well as conversations between each director and the lead director. The\nevaluation focuses on the Board’s and the committees’ contributions to Carvana and has an enhanced focus on areas in which the Board or management\nbelieves that the Board could improve.\nAs part of the annual Board self-evaluation, the Board evaluates whether the current leadership structure continues to be appropriate for\nCarvana and its stockholders. Our corporate governance guidelines provide the flexibility for our Board to modify our leadership structure in the future as\nappropriate.\nSECTION 16(A) BENEFICIAL OWNERSHIP REPORTING COMPLIANCE.\nSection 16(a) of the Exchange Act requires our directors, executive officers and greater-than-ten-percent stockholders to file initial reports of\nownership and reports of changes in ownership of any of our securities with the SEC and us. We believe that during the 2018 fiscal year, all of our directors,\nexecutive officers and greater-than-ten-percent stockholders complied with the requirements of Section 16(a).\nRISK OVERSIGHT\nThe Board, as a whole and through the Audit Committee, oversees our risk management program, which is designed to identify, evaluate, and\nrespond to our high priority risks and opportunities. The risk management program facilitates constructive dialog at the senior management and board level\nto proactively realize opportunities and manage risks. Our Audit Committee is primarily responsible for overseeing our risk management processes on\nbehalf of the full board. Our management, including our executive officers, is primarily responsible for managing the risks associated with the operation and\nbusiness of our company and provides regular updates to the Audit Committee and annual updates to the full board on the risk management program and\nreports on the identified high priority risks and opportunities.\nCODEOFETHICSANDCONDUCT\nWe have adopted a code of business conduct and ethics that applies to all of our employees, officers, and directors, including those officers\nresponsible for financial reporting. Our code of business conduct and ethics is available on our website at investors.carvana.com/corporategovernance/governance-documents.\nWe intend to disclose any amendments to the code or waivers of its requirements on our website.\n- 14 -\nTable of Contents\nCOMPENSATION COMMITTEE INTERLOCKS AND INSIDER PARTICIPATION\nNo interlocking relationships exist between the members of our Board and the board or compensation committee of any other company.\nCOMMUNICATIONS BY STOCKHOLDERS AND OTHER INTERESTED PARTIES WITH THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS\nStockholders and other interested parties may contact an individual director, the lead director, the Board as a group, or a specified board\ncommittee or group, including the non-management directors as a group, by sending regular mail to\nCarvana Co.\n1930 W.

Carvana generally will not forward to the directors a communication that is primarily commercial in\nnature, relates to an improper or irrelevant topic, or requests general information regarding Carvana.\nDIRECTOR COMPENSATION\nPrior to our IPO, none of our directors received compensation as a director from us. We have designed our non-employee director\ncompensation program to achieve the following objectives:\n• align directors’ interests with the long-term interests of our shareholders;\n• attract and retain outstanding director candidates with diverse backgrounds and experiences; and\n• recognize the substantial time commitment required to serve as a Carvana director.\nThe Compensation and Nominating Committee reviews the Company’s director compensation program annually. Independent directors may\nnot receive, directly or indirectly, any consulting, advisory or other compensatory fees from us. Members of the Board who are employees of Carvana do\nnot receive compensation for their service on the Board.

We had another year of triple-digit growth in unit retails sold and revenue, while making significant\nprogress in our gross profit per unit and EBITDA margin. Our growth has few historical precedents and makes us one of the fastest-growing technology,\nconsumer, or retail companies at our scale.\nThe highlights of our 2018 performance include:\n• 113% increase in retail units sold, from 44,252 to 94,108;\n• 128% revenue growth, from $859 million to $1.96 billion;\n- 19 -\nTable of Contents\n• 41 new markets, bringing our total from 44 to 85;\n• 8 additional car vending machines, bringing our total from 7 to 15;\n• a $551 increase in gross profit per unit (incl. gift) from $1,539 to $2,090, and a $594 increase in gross profit per unit ex-Gift, from $1,539 to\n$2,133;\n• an increase in net loss margin (incl. Gift) from (19.1%) to (13.0%);\n• an increase in EBITDA margin ex-Gift, from (16.9%) to (9.9%); and\nNotethatgrossprofitperunitex-giftandEBITDAmarginex-giftarenon-GAAPmeasures.Adescriptionofthesemeasuresandareconciliationofthese\nmeasurestothenearestcomparableGAAPmeasurecanbefoundintheannexofthisproxystatement.\n- 20 -\nTable of Contents\n• a one-year total shareholder return of 71.1%, significantly outperforming our peer group companies (see “Competitiveness of our\nCompensation Program” below) as an index as well as the S&P 500 and S&P 500 Retailing Indices.\nKEYCOMPENSATIONDESIGNANDDECISIONSTOLINKPAYANDPERFORMANCE\nUnderlying our executive compensation program is a strong belief in promoting a pay-for-performance culture. We accomplish this by linking\na significant portion of the compensation of our executive officers, including our named executive officers, to our performance. In addition, the\nCompensation and Nomination Committee seeks to set challenging threshold and target performance levels that reflect our rapid growth trajectory and\nbusiness plans rather than goals based on prior years’ achievements. For each of the metrics used in our performance-based compensation plans, payouts are\nearned based upon outstanding performance as measured against pre-established financial objectives.\nCORPORATEGOVERNANCEHIGHLIGHTSREGARDINGEXECUTIVECOMPENSATION\nWe endeavor to maintain sound executive compensation policies and practices, including compensation-related corporate governance\nstandards, consistent with our executive compensation philosophy. The following summarizes our executive compensation and related governance policies\nand practices:\n- 21 -\nTable of Contents\nWHAT WE DO WHAT WE DO NOT DO\n✓ A significant portion of compensation is “at risk” and tied to long-term\ncompany performance\nû No discretionary or guaranteed incentives payments\nû No new or legacy exercise-tax gross-up provisions\n✓ Annual incentive plan metrics are solely based on company performance;\nawards are determined based on pre-established targets\nû No option repricing without stockholder consent\n✓\n✓\n✓\n✓\nMarket-based executive compensation levels are reviewed by\nCompensation and Nominating Committee annually\nPerformance-measured incentive awards are subject to a compensation\nrecoupment policy\nExecutives are prohibited from hedging\nAn independent compensation consultant is retained to evaluate our\nexecutive compensation and make recommendations\nWe believe that we have designed executive compensation plans that effectively support our strategic and financial goals, create a culture of\nteamwork, and are directly tied to the performance of the company and shareholder outcomes. We will continue to utilize rigorous governance processes to\nmonitor and evaluate the compensation programs as well as implement best practices in compensation governance. We welcome shareholder feedback on\nour programs.\nCOMPENSATION OBJECTIVES AND PRINCIPLES\nCarvana seeks to create and maintain a culture of teamwork and high performance. Our executive compensation programs are one of the tools\nwe utilize to accomplish this objective. Philosophically, we aim to treat our executives fairly when considering:\n• the complexity of their jobs,\n• the market for their executive talent,\n• their individual performance,\n• the financial and strategic performance of the company, and\n• the need to retain the executives.\nWithin that framework, it is critical that we meet our objectives to:\n• attract and retain the best executive talent to support our growth,\n• align the interests of our executives with those of our shareholders, and\n• provide incentives that are linked directly to our long- and short-term strategy.\nWe set very challenging goals as our incentive compensation metrics and we expect that our executives will in aggregate be paid approximately\nat the median for achieving those goals through the plans outlined in this CD&A. As evidenced by our track record of growth and strategic progress, our\napproach to executive compensation has been effective.\n- 22 -\nTable of Contents\nCOMPENSATION SETTING PROCESS\nROLEOFCOMPENSATIONANDNOMINATINGCOMMITTEEANDCHIEFEXECUTIVEOFFICERINSETTINGEXECUTIVECOMPENSATION\nThe Compensation and Nominating Committee has responsibility for overseeing the design, development, and implementation of the\ncompensation program for our chief executive officer and other NEOs. The committee evaluates the performance of our chief executive officer and the\nperformance of the other executive officers. Our chief executive officer assists the committee in evaluating the performance of our other executive officers,\nincluding the named executive officers other than the chief executive officer. Our chief executive officer does not participate in portions of committee\nmeetings or meetings of the Board when his compensation is discussed and determined, and has requested that his total compensation be set significantly\nbelow the market median due to his significant ownership interest in our company\nBased on these assessments, the members of the Compensation and Nominating Committee, each of whom is an independent director, make the\nfinal compensation decisions for the NEOs other than the CEO, and make recommendations to the Board for the CEO’s compensation. The Board makes\nthe final decision for the CEO’s compensation.\nINDEPENDENTCOMPENSATIONADVISOR\nOur Compensation and Nominating Committee believes that independent advice is important in developing Carvana’s executive compensation\nprograms. Since September 2017, the committee has engaged Korn Ferry as its independent compensation consultant to advise on executive compensation\nmatters. All work performed by the independent compensation consultant regarding our executive compensation program is tasked and overseen directly by\nthe committee. Our management provides information and analyses to the committee at the committee’s direction.\nIn addition to advising on our executive compensation program, Korn Ferry, at the request of and in service to the committee, provided certain\nother compensation advisory services for 2018 compensation, including assistance with establishing a compensation peer group, benchmarking aggregate\nbroad-based equity usage (including run-rate and total dilution), benchmarking director compensation, benchmarking\nnon-executive employee compensation in certain job families within our company, and developing the narrative disclosure in this Compensation Discussion\nand Analysis. Our Compensation and Nominating Committee paid Korn Ferry $103,000 for their 2018 services.\nKorn Ferry does not provide any other material services to Carvana Co. The committee has assessed the independence of Korn Ferry pursuant\nto the NYSE rules and concluded that Korn Ferry’s work for the committee did not raise any conflicts of interest.\n- 23 -\nTable of Contents\nCOMPETITIVENESS OF OUR COMPENSATION PROGRAM\nOur executive compensation program is designed so that the sum of base pay plus total short- and long-term compensation is competitive with\nmarket practices. Market practices—or benchmarks—are based on peer-group data and compensation survey data.\nThe past year, 2018, was our first year of developing a compensation peer group. Many of our direct industry competitors are either privately\nheld companies or are larger than us in revenue size, although very few have our growth trajectory. The Compensation and Nominating Committee, with the\nassistance of its compensation consultant, Korn Ferry, reviewed and selected potential peer companies based on revenue size, industry focus, growth rates,\ncomplexity of operations, customer base, and market for talent. With the assistance of its compensation consultant, the committee approved the following\ncompensation peer group in order to determine market pay levels and pay practices for fiscal year 2018:\n• 1-800-Flowers.com, Inc.\n• America’s Car-Mart, Inc.\n• Cars.com Inc.\n• Etsy, Inc.\n• Grubhub, Inc.\n• MarineMax, Inc.\n• Monro, Inc.\n• Overstock.com, Inc.\n• RH\n• Sleep Number Corporation\n• TrueCar, Inc.\n• U.S. Auto Parts Network, Inc.\n• Wayfair Inc.\n• Zillow Group, Inc.\nGoing forward, the Compensation and Nominating Committee expects to review our compensation peer group on an annual basis for continued\nappropriateness, considering changes in both our size and business and the businesses of the companies in the peer group.\nThe committee also uses compensation survey data in its evaluation of executive pay for the NEOs. Survey data provides insight into positions\nthat may not generally be reported in proxy statements and information about the compensation of executives of non-public companies. To assist the\ncommittee in evaluating fiscal year 2018 compensation levels, the committee reviewed both peer-group proxy data and information from survey databases,\nutilizing appropriate subsets based on the size of the company.\nCOMPENSATION COMPONENTS\nIn accordance with our overall compensation philosophy and program, executives are provided with a mix of base salary, short-term incentives,\nlong-term incentives and employee benefits. Our compensation philosophy places a significant portion of the potential total compensation for each NEO “at\nrisk” such that compensation will vary based on performance of Carvana. Variable compensation is a component of compensation for most of our\nemployees, but a higher proportion of our NEOs’ compensation is at risk than that of our general employee population. As shown in the pay mix chart\nbelow, our compensation program is designed to be highly performance-based with approximately 80% of each of our NEO’s compensation tied to our\nfinancial performance and stock price performance.\n- 24 -\nTable of Contents\nThe following table describes the material elements of compensation and the objectives of each element:\nPROGRAM DESCRIPTION OBJECTIVES\nANNUAL COMPENSATION:\nBaseSalary\nAnnualIncentivePlan\nLONG-TERM COMPENSATION:\nLong-TermIncentiveProgram\n• Ongoing cash compensation based on executive\nofficer’s role, responsibilities, competitive market\npositioning, and individual performance.\n• Annual cash incentive with target award amounts for\neach executive officer.\n• Actual cash awards may be higher or lower than\ntarget, based on the company’s financial\nperformance.\n• A long-term incentive program using a combination\nof time-vested and performance-based awards.\n- 25 -\n• Attract and retain qualified key managerial talent.\n• Recognize sustained individual performance.\n• Attract and retain qualified key managerial talent.\n• Encourage and reward achievement of annual\nperformance objectives.\n• Focus executives on long-term company performance\nand long-term financial and strategic success.\n• Retention.\n• Align employee and stockholder interests via\nperformance goals and stock ownership.\nTable of Contents\nBASESALARY\nThe base salaries for the named executive officers are reviewed annually by the Compensation and Nominating Committee. Individual salaries\nare determined based upon a combination of factors, including the scope of responsibilities, individual performance and experience, our company’s\nperformance, an individual’s potential for making contributions to future company performance, and competitive pay practices. The committee considers all\nthese factors in determining base salary increases and does not assign a specific weighting to any individual factor.\nIn February 2018, the Compensation and Nominating Committee reviewed the base salaries of our executive officers, including our named\nexecutive officers, taking into consideration the factors described above. Following this review, the committee determined to maintain the base salary of our\nCEO at its 2017 level and to increase the base salaries of the other four named executive officers to maintain the competitiveness of this compensation\nelement. All of the NEOs’ 2018 base salaries were approximately at or below the market median as determined by the compensation consultant.\nErnest Garcia III, our chief executive officer, had a base salary of $400,000 for both 2017 and 2018, with no increase. Mark Jenkins, our chief\nfinancial officer, had a 2017 base salary of $350,000 and a 2018 base salary of $375,000, an increase of 7.1%. Benjamin Huston, our chief operating officer,\nhad a 2017 base salary of $350,000 and a 2018 base salary of $375,000, an increase of 7.1%. Ryan Keeton, our chief brand officer, had a 2017 base salary\nof $315,000 and a 2018 base salary of $330,000, an increase of 4.8%. Daniel Gill, our chief product officer, had a 2017 base salary of $315,000 and a 2018\nbase salary of $330,000, an increase of 4.8%.\n2018ANNUALINCENTIVEPLAN\nOur annual incentive plan was designed to align our executive officers’ incentives with our company goals and, therefore, to be aligned with the\ninterests of our shareholders. The Compensation and Nominating Committee approves which executives are eligible to participate (other than the CEO) and\nthe level of potential awards, identifies appropriate performance measures, and determines the financial targets of each measure. The CEO makes\nrecommendations as to these matters, but the Compensation and Nominating Committee makes all decisions with respect to the implementation of the\nannual incentive plan. For the CEO’s annual incentive plan, the Compensation and Nominating Committee makes a recommendation, with the Board\nmaking the final decision. In establishing performance goals, the committee and the Board as a whole review industry and market conditions, alignment of\nthe goals with our strategy, projected general economic conditions, and both our past and forecasted performance levels.\nTargetBonusesandPayoutRanges\nFor the 2018 annual incentive plan, the committee established a target bonus at 66.7% of base salary for each of the NEOs, with a payout range\nof 0%–133% of base salary. Utilizing the same bonus target for all the NEOs promotes a culture of teamwork among the senior executives and encourages\ntheir entrepreneurial spirit. As a result, the CEO’s target 2018 total cash, including both base salary and target annual incentive plan amount, is below the\nmarket 25 th percentile of our compensation peer group.\n- 26 -\nTable of Contents\nThe resulting payout range for Mr. Garcia, our chief executive officer, is $0–$530,667, with a target of $266,667. For both Mr. Jenkins, our\nchief financial officer, and Mr. Huston, our chief operating officer, the payout range is $0–$497,500, with a target of $250,000. For both Mr. Keeton, our\nchief brand officer, and Mr. Gill, our chief product officer, the payout range is $0–$437,800, with a target bonus of $220,000.\nPerformanceMetricsandGoals\nThe performance period for the annual incentive is our fiscal year. The committee selected retail units sold, gross profit per unit ex-Gift, and\nEBITDA margin ex-Gift as the performance metrics for our 2018 annual incentive plan because these are the primary metrics we use in evaluating our own\nperformance when communicating our financial results to our investors.\nThe committee believes that these performance measures help focus the executives on growing retail units sold and revenue, increasing total\ngross profit per unit, and demonstrating operating leverage. The detailed definition of each measure and rationale of selection are provided below:\nPERFORMANCE\nMETRICS USED IN\nTHE 2018 AIP WEIGHT DEFINITION RATIONALE OF SELECTION\nRetailUnitsSold 40% The number of vehicles\nsold to customers in a\ngiven period, net of\nreturns under our\nseven-day return policy.\nGrossProfitper\nUnitex-Gift\n40% The gross profit before\ncompensation expense\nrelated to the 100k\nMilestone Gift (as\nhereinafter defined) is\nincluded in cost of sales,\ndivided by retail units sold\nin that period.\nWe view retail units sold as a key measure of our growth for several reasons.\nFirst, retail units sold is the primary driver of our revenues and, indirectly, gross\nprofit, since retail unit sales enable multiple complementary revenue streams,\nincluding financing, VSCs, GAP waiver coverage, and trade-ins. Second, growth\nin retail units sold increases the base of available customers for referrals and\nrepeat sales. Third, growth in retail units sold is an indicator of our ability to\nsuccessfully scale our logistics, fulfillment, and customer service operations.\nTotal gross profit per unit ex-Gift is driven by sales of used vehicles, each of\nwhich generates additional revenue sources including wholesale sales of vehicles\nwe acquire from customers as trade-ins, gains on the sales of loans originated to\nfinance the vehicle, revenue from GAP waiver coverage, and commissions on\nsales of VSCs. We believe total gross profit per unit ex-Gift is a key measure of\nour growth and long-term profitability.\n- 27 -\nTable of Contents\nEBITDAMarginex-Gift 20% Net loss before interest\nexpense, income tax\nexpense, depreciation and\namortization expense, and\nthe compensation expense\nrelated to the 100k\nMilestone Gift, as a\npercentage of total\nrevenues.\nWe believe that EBITDA Margin ex-Gift is an important measure of the leverage\nin our business and a useful measure to us and to our investors because it focuses\nspecifically on operational performance.\nAt the beginning of 2018, the committee established financial performance goals that were challenging and reflective of Carvana’s fiscal 2018\noperating plan, economic and market conditions, and forecasts at the time the performance goals were established. The target performance goal of each\nmetric is significantly above fiscal 2017’s actual results: over 92,000 retail units sold, a 108% increase over fiscal year 2017’s retail units sold of 44,252;\nover $2,100 for gross profit per unit ex-Gift, a $561 increase over fiscal year 2017’s gross profit per unit ex-Gift of $1,539; and EBITDA margin ex-Gift of\nless than (7.2)%, a 9.7 percentage point improvement over fiscal year 2017’s EBTIDA margin ex-Gift of (16.9)%.\nTotalPayouts\nBased on the committee’s evaluation of our 2018 actual performance against the annual incentive plan goals, 88% of the target annual bonuses\nwere paid out, amounting to 59% of the NEOs’ respective base salaries. The annual incentive bonus received by each of the NEOs is included in the\n“Non-Equity Performance Incentive Plan Compensation” column in the 2018 Summary Compensation Table in this proxy statement.\nEach of the annual incentive metrics provided a payout range of 0%–199% as a percent of the target. For Retail Units Sold, weighted 40% of\nthe total, the target was over 92,000, and our actual performance was 94,108, resulting in a payout of 118% of the target payout. For gross profit per unit ex-\nGift, weighted 40% of the total, the target was over $2,100 and our actual performance was $2,133, resulting in a payout of 103% of the target. For\nEBITDA Margin ex-Gift, weighted 20% of the total, our target was less than (7.2)% and our actual performance was (9.9)%, resulting in no payout.\nAggregating each of the respective payouts, weighted accordingly, resulted in a total payout of 88% of target. Applying the payout of 88% of target to each\nof our NEOs respective target bonuses, Mr. Garcia achieved a $235,733 payout amount; Messrs. Jenkins and Huston achieved a payout of $221,000 each,\nand Messrs. Keeton and Gill achieved a payout of $194,480 each.\nLONG-TERMINCENTIVEPROGRAM\nThe Compensation and Nominating Committee believes that stock-based performance compensation is essential to align the interests of\nCarvana’s management and its shareholders in enhancing the long-term value of our equity and to encourage executives to remain with the company.\nAmong the varied types of equity awards the committee is authorized to use under the equity plan, stock options are the ones that the committee has\ndetermined are preferable for use with NEOs, because their\n- 28 -\nTable of Contents\nvalue is more leveraged to future value appreciation and depends upon a future increase in the value of our common stock. The committee also has\ndetermined that restricted stock unit grants to NEOs should be used for the purposes of retention or recognition of outstanding performance in part because\nrestricted stock units are less volatile than stock options.\n2018AnnualGrant\nFor fiscal 2018, the Compensation and Nominating Committee determined to award an equal blend of time-based stock options and restricted\nstock units to provide a mix composed of awards whose value depends upon a future increase in the value of the common stock (time-based stock options)\nand awards that serve primarily as a retention tool (time-based restricted stock units).\nFor the 2018 annual grant, the committee targeted a grant value equal to the amount of each executive’s base salary. The committee initially\ntargeted the annual grant based on a 10-day average stock price as of April 2, 2018 ($21.61). Based on that price, Mr. Garcia would have received 15,988\noptions and 9,255 RSUs; Messrs. Jenkins and Huston would have received 14,989 options and 8,677 RSUs; and Messrs. Keeton and Gill would have\nreceived 13,190 options and 7,635 RSUs. However, the grants were not awarded until mid-July when the stock price had more than doubled ($44.21). To\ncompensate the executives for the disadvantage of receiving stock options with a much higher exercise price, the Committee determined to grant additional\nRSUs. The grant value of the additional RSUs is equal to one-half of the in-the-money value difference between the options granted based on the March\nstock price and the options granted based on the July stock price, resulting in a total of 13,987 RSUs granted to Mr. Garcia, 13,113 to Messrs. Jenkins and\nHuston each, and 11,540 to Messrs. Keeton and Gill each.\n2018SpecialPerformance-ContingentGrant\nFor fiscal 2018, the Compensation and Nominating Committee and the Board also granted a one-time special performance-contingent RSU\naward for driving exceptional company performance to achieve an important milestone in the development of the business. The RSUs were granted on\nApril 30, 2018, to the NEOs other than the CEO; the CEO received his award on May 1, 2018. Mr. Garcia was granted 14,572 RSUs ($393,298 grant\nvalue), Messrs. Jenkins and Huston 13,662 RSUs ($358,081 grant value), and Messrs. Keeton and Gill 12,022 RSUs ($315,097 grant value). All of these\ngrants will vest 100% on the date of the first periodic report filed where positive quarterly EBITDA is reported. None of the RSUs were vested as of the end\nof 2018.\n2018100kMilestoneGift\nOn September 10, 2018, we announced a commitment by our chief executive officer, Ernest Garcia III (“Mr. Garcia”), to contribute 165 shares\nof Class A common stock to us from his personal shareholdings for every one of our then-existing employees, including the NEOs, upon their satisfying\ncertain employment tenure requirements. In connection with these contributions, we have made corresponding grants of 165 restricted stock units under our\n2017 Omnibus Incentive Plan to each employee who has satisfied the requirements and we intend to make grants to the remaining then-existing employees\nas they satisfy the requirements (the “100k Milestone Gift” or “Gift”). Messrs. Jenkins, Huston, Keeton, and Gill all received the grant in 2018, which had a\ngrant date fair value of $10,562.\n- 29 -\nTable of Contents\nPERQUISITESANDBENEFITS\nCurrently, we do not view perquisites or other personal benefits as a significant component of our executive compensation program.\nAccordingly, we did not provide perquisites to our executive officers in 2018, including our named executive officers, except that each of the NEOs, along\nwith certain other employees, can use one of the company inventory vehicles (which generally will be replaced every three years); each, along with many of\nour employees, may use a company-provided cellular phone; and each, along with all of our employees, may participate in our 401(k) match benefit which\nis based on salary.\nWe do not expect that any future perquisites or other personal benefits will be a significant aspect of our executive compensation program. All\nfuture practices with respect to perquisites or other personal benefits will be approved and subject to periodic review by the Compensation and Nominating\nCommittee.\nTERMINATION,SEVERANCEANDCHANGEINCONTROLBENEFITS\nWe do not have employment or severance agreements with our executives.\nIn the event of a change in control of Carvana Group, all outstanding unvested Class B Unit awards held by participants in the Carvana Group\nequity incentive plan, whose employment has not previously terminated, will accelerate in full, subject to certain escrow demand rights held by a purchaser\nof control of Carvana Group.\nIf an executive is terminated involuntarily without cause within twenty-four months following a change in control as defined by our 2018\nequity award agreements, all outstanding vested stock options and time-based RSUs of that executive will become fully exercisable or vested. An executive\nwhose employment is terminated because of death or disability will receive one year from the time of termination to exercise any then-vested options\ninstead of the usual 90 days, but not past the expiration date of the options. If a person’s employment is terminated for disability, and that person later dies\nwithin a year, the legal representative of the person’s estate may exercise the options within one year of the date of death, though not past the expiration date\nof the options.\nIf a change in control occurs before the performance-contingent RSUs are vested, outstanding shares will vest in a proportionate number based\non the company’s progress toward positive EBITDA, starting from the EBITDA loss baseline as of the end of the calendar quarter immediately preceding\nthe award (-$41.5 million) to the EBITDA as of the end of the calendar quarter immediately preceding the date of the closing of the change in control.\nExcept for these arrangements, none of our named executive officers have entered into any plans, arrangements or agreements with Carvana\nproviding for payments upon termination of employment or change in control of Carvana, other than payments generally available to all salaried employees\nthat do not discriminate in scope, terms, or operation in favor of the executive officers of Carvana.\n- 30 -\nTable of Contents\nCOMPENSATION-RELATED POLICIES\nCOMPENSATIONRECOVERY(“CLAWBACK”)POLICY\nIn 2018, the Compensation and Nominating Committee approved the adoption of a “clawback” policy, which would provide for the clawback\nor recoupment of any compensation granted, earned, or vested that is tied to performance metrics, in the event of an accounting restatement resulting from\nmaterial noncompliance with certain financial reporting requirements that reveals that such performance (or level of performance) was not achieved.\nPOLICYREGARDINGHEDGINGANDPLEDGINGOFCOMPANYSTOCK\nCarvana’s insider trading policy prohibits all employees from buying or selling Carvana securities while aware of material nonpublic\ninformation and prohibits the disclosure of material nonpublic information to others who then trade in our securities. As part of this policy, certain other\nCarvana-securities-related transactions by directors, officers and other employees are also prohibited or subject to specific notice and pre-approval\nrequirements. The policy is premised on the belief that even in those circumstances where the proposed transaction may not constitute a violation of law or\napplicable regulations, it is nonetheless inappropriate for any director, officer, or other employee to engage in short-term or speculative transactions in our\nsecurities which may be viewed as reducing their incentive to improve our performance or inconsistent with the objectives of our stockholders in general.\nTherefore, it is our policy that directors, officers, and other employees may not engage in any transactions involving our securities which constitute short\nsales, puts, calls, or other similar derivative securities. The policy also prohibits certain other transactions, including hedging or monetization transactions—\ne.g., zero-cost collars, forward sale contracts, and arrangements pledging company securities as collateral for a loan (without adequate assurance of other\navailable assets to satisfy the loan).\nCOMPENSATION AND RISK\nWe believe that our compensation programs create appropriate incentives to drive sustained, long-term increases in shareholder value. These\nprograms have been designed and administered in a manner that discourages undue risk-taking by employees. Relevant features of these programs include:\n• Focus on weighting compensation toward four-year and greater vesting schedules of equity awards;\n- 31 -\nTable of Contents\n• individual executive pay generally targeted at median level against comparable executive roles at an appropriate set of peer\ncompanies, except the chief executive officer, for whom we target significantly below median level due to his significant\nownership interest in us;\n• robust clawback policies permitting the recoupment of past incentive pay from executive officers in the event of certain kinds of\nmisconduct, and forfeiture of incentive awards in the event the executive engages in various types of conduct deemed detrimental\nto Carvana’s interests, including theft or fraud against Carvana and engaging in competition with Carvana;\n• no employment agreements with executive officers;\n• the use of retail units sold, gross profit per unit ex-Gift and EBITDA margin ex-Gift as performance metrics, which incents\nemployees to increase earnings and manage net assets efficiently;\n• restrictions on trading in Carvana Class A common stock to reduce insider trading compliance risk, as well as prohibitions on\npledging and hedging Carvana capital stock.\nIn light of these features, we conclude that the risks arising from our executive and employee compensation policies and practices are not\nreasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the company.\nTAX AND ACCOUNTING IMPLICATIONS\nCarvana considers the tax and accounting aspects of the elements of compensation we offer in determining the most effective method for\ncompensating our executives. This includes, but is not limited to, Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code and the regulations thereunder.\nSection 162(m) generally limits the tax deduction available to public companies for annual compensation paid to the chief executive officer and certain\nother named executive officers in excess of $1 million.\nAs a result of 2017 tax legislation, compensation paid in a fiscal year in excess of $1 million to, or on behalf of, an individual who is a “covered\nemployee” is not expected to be deductible under Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code, unless such compensation qualifies for transition relief\n(relating to written binding contracts in effect on November 2, 2017, which were not subsequently materially modified). Therefore, certain compensation\npaid under our existing equity plans and certain of our long-term equity awards originally designed with the intent that such amounts qualify as\n“performance-based” compensation may not be deductible in the future. Although the committee may consider the effect that Section 162(m) and the\npotential lack of deduction for amounts paid in excess of the deduction limit may have on Carvana, the committee continues to retain flexibility to make\ncompensation decisions, in the exercise of its business judgment, that are based on factors that it determines to be appropriate (as determined by the\ncommittee in its sole discretion) to enable Carvana to continue to attract, retain, reward, and motivate its highly-qualified executives.

See “Certain\nRelationships and Related Party Transactions – Relationship with DriveTime – Aircraft Time Sharing Agreement.” The incremental cost to Carvana\nof aircraft used under the aircraft time sharing agreement for a non-business flight is calculated by multiplying the aircraft’s per-mile variable\noperating cost by a flight’s total mileage, which includes the mileage of an empty return flight. Variable operating costs include: (1) landing, parking,\npassenger ground transportation, crew travel, and flight planning services expenses; (2) supplies, catering, and crew traveling expenses; (3) aircraft\nfuel and oil expenses; (4) maintenance, parts, and external labor (inspections and repairs); and (5) any customs, foreign permit, and similar fees. Fixed\ncosts that do not vary based upon usage are not included in the calculation of direct operating cost. On certain occasions, a named executive officer or\na named executive officer’s spouse or other family member may fly on the corporate aircraft as additional passengers. No additional direct operating\ncost is incurred in such situations under the foregoing methodology because the costs would not be incremental. Carvana does not pay its named\nexecutive officers any amounts in respect of taxes (so-called gross-up payments) on income imputed to them for non-business aircraft usage.\n(iii) The incremental cost of the company car to us has been calculated based on the depreciation value of the vehicle.\n(iv) Represents the cost of company-paid cell phone service.\n(v) Mr. Garcia’s “All Other Compensation” for 2018 was less than $10,000.\n- 35 -\nTable of Contents\nGRANTS OF PLAN-BASED AWAR DS\nGRANT\nDATE\nESTIMATED FUTURE PAYOUTS\nUNDER NON-EQUITY INCENTIVE\nPLAN AWARDS (1)\nTHRESHOLD\n($)\nTARGET\n($)\nMAXIMUM\n($)\nESTIMATED FUTURE PAYOUTS\nUNDER EQUITY INCENTIVE PLAN\nAWARDS (2)\nTHRESHOLD\n(#)\nTARGET\n(#)\nMAXIMUM\n(#)\nALL OTHER\nSTOCK\nAWARDS:\nNUMBER OF\nSHARES OF\nSTOCK OR\nUNITS (#)\nALL OTHER\nOPTION\nAWARDS:\nNUMBER OF\nSECURITIES\nUNDERLYING\nOPTIONS (#)\nEXERCISE\nOR BASE\nPRICE OF\nOPTION\nAWARDS\n($/SH)\nGRANT\nDATE FAIR\nVALUE OF\nSTOCK AN\nOPTION\nAWARDS (3\nNAME\nErnest\nGarcia III 4/30/2018 0 266,667 530,667 — — — — — — $ —\n4/30/2018 — — — 0 14,572 14,572 — — — $ 393,29\n7/28/2018 — — — — — — 13,987 — — $ 618,36\n7/28/2018 — — — — — — — 15,988 $ 44.21 $ 428,32\nMark\nJenkins 4/30/2018 0 250,000 497,500 — — — — — — $ —\n4/30/2018 — — — 0 13,662 13,662 — — — $ 358,08\n7/28/2018 — — — — — — 13,113 — — $ 579,72\n7/28/2018 — — — — — — — 14,989 $ 44.21 $ 401,56\n9/13/2018(4) — — — — — — 165 — — $ 10,56\nBenjamin\nHuston 4/30/2018 0 250,000 497,500 — — — — — — $ —\n4/30/2018 — — — 0 13,662 13,662 — — — $ 358,08\n7/28/2018 — — — — — — 13,113 — — $ 579,72\n7/28/2018 — — — — — — — 14,989 $ 44.21 $ 401,56\n9/13/2018(4) — — — — — — 165 — — $ 10,56\nRyan\nKeeton 4/30/2018 0 220,000 437,800 — — — — — — $ —\n4/30/2018 — — — 0 12,022 12,022 — — — $ 315,09\n7/28/2018 — — — — — — 11,540 — — $ 510,18\n7/28/2018 — — — — — — — 13,190 $ 44.21 $ 353,36\n9/13/2018(4) — — — — — — 165 — — $ 10,56\nDaniel Gill 4/30/2018 0 220,000 437,800 — — — — — — $ —\n4/30/2018 — — — 0 12,022 12,022 — — — $ 315,09\n7/28/2018 — — — — — — 11,540 — — $ 510,18\n7/28/2018 — — — — — — — 13,190 $ 44.21 $ 353,36\n9/13/2018(4) — — — — — — 165 — — $ 10,56\n(1) The amounts in these columns represent the threshold, target, and maximum payouts for the 2018 annual incentive plan, as described above under\n“Compensation Discussion and Analysis.” Actual payouts are reflected in the “Summary Compensation Table.”\n(2) The amounts in these columns represent the number of shares that would be issued upon vesting of the RSUs granted under the 2018 special\nperformance-contingent grant upon achievement of the EBITDA performance target, as described above under “Compensation Discussion and\nAnalysis.”\n(3) The amounts reported in this column represent the grant date fair value of the options and RSUs granted to the named executive officers as computed\nin accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification Topic 718.\n(4) These grants represent the amount awarded under the 100k Milestone Gift, which was given to all of our employees who were employed as of\nSeptember 10, 2018, and who met certain employment-tenure requirements.

The\nperformance-contingent RSUs would also vest on a change of control, but in proportion to the progress made toward positive EBITDA. None of the\nperformance-contingent restricted stock units would be subject to accelerated vesting as of December 31, 2018, because EBITDA as of that date had\nnot progressed beyond the baseline.\n(2) Amounts in this column represent the market value as of December 31, 2018, of all outstanding time-based RSUs, which would become fully vested\nif the executive is involuntarily terminated without cause within 24 months of a change of control of Carvana Co. In that event, outstanding unvested\nstock options would also become fully vested and exercisable, but as of December 31, 2018, the price of Carvana’s Class A common stock did not\nexceed the strike price of those unvested options.\n- 38 -\nTable of Contents\nCEO PAY RATIO\nThe 2018 annual total compensation of our median-compensated employee other than Mr. Garcia was $36,204. We identified our mediancompensated\nemployee by calculating the annual salary of all our employees as of December 31, 2018, annualized for those who joined Carvana during the\nyear and who were not seasonal or temporary employees. Mr. Garcia’s 2018 annual total compensation was $2,075,726, as disclosed in the “Summary\nCompensation Table” above. The ratio of our median-compensated employee to Mr. Garcia is 1-to-57.\nCERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS\nPOLICIES FOR APPROVAL OF RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS\nWe have adopted a written policy with respect to the review, approval, and ratification of related party transactions. Under the policy, our Audit\nCommittee is responsible for reviewing and approving related party transactions. In the course of its review and approval of related party transactions, our\nAudit Committee will consider the relevant facts and circumstances to decide whether to approve such transactions. In particular, our policy requires our\nAudit Committee to consider, among other factors it deems appropriate:\n• the related person’s relationship to us and interest in the transaction,\n• the material facts of the proposed transaction, including the proposed aggregate value of the transaction,\n• the impact on a director’s independence in the event the related person is a director or an immediate family member of the director,\n• the benefits to us of the proposed transaction,\n• if applicable, the availability of other sources of comparable products or services, and\n• an assessment of whether the proposed transaction is on terms that are comparable to the terms available to an unrelated third party or to\nemployees generally.\nThe Audit Committee may only approve those transactions that are in or are not inconsistent with our best interests and those of our\nstockholders, as the Audit Committee determines in good faith.\nAMENDED AND R ESTATED OPERATING AGREEMENT\nIn connection with the organizational transactions we effected in connection with our IPO, we amended and restated Carvana Group’s existing\noperating agreement, which we refer to as the “LLC Operating Agreement.” In addition, on March 2, 2018, Carvana Group signed an amendment of its\nLLC Agreement to, among other things, create a class of convertible preferred units. The convertible preferred units were created in connection with the\nDecember 5, 2017, issuance and sale of 100,000 shares of convertible preferred stock of Carvana Co. The amendment was effective December 5, 2017. As\nof December 31, 2018, the 100,000 shares of convertible preferred stock had all been converted into shares of Class A common stock and are no longer\noutstanding.\n- 39 -\nTable of Contents\nIn connection with the issuance of our senior notes (see Carvana’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for 2018, page 66–67), Carvana Group\namended its LLC agreement to create a class of non-convertible preferred units, which Carvana Co. purchased with its net proceeds from the issuance of\nthese senior notes.\nThe operations of Carvana Group, and the rights and obligations of the holders of our LLC Units (who we refer to as “LLC Unitholders”), are\nset forth in the LLC Operating Agreement.\nEXCHANGE AGREEMENT\nOn April 27, 2017, we entered into an exchange agreement with Carvana Co. Sub LLC (our wholly owned subsidiary) and the LLC\nUnitholders. Under the exchange agreement, LLC Unitholders (and certain permitted transferees thereof) may exchange at any time their LLC Units for\neither shares of our Class A common stock or for cash, whichever we decide. To the extent LLC Unitholders also hold Class B common stock, they will be\nrequired to deliver to us the same number of shares of Class B common stock as Class A common stock being exchanged for. We will then cancel those\nshares of Class B common stock. As LLC Unitholders exchange their interest in Carvana Group, our indirect interest in Carvana Group will increase\ncorrespondingly.\nWhen an LLC Unitholder makes an exchange, they will receive four shares of Class A common stock for every five Class A Units or, at our\noption, cash equal to the value of a share of Class A common stock multiplied by 0.8 times the number of Class A Units being exchanged. The value of the\nClass A common stock is determined by the average of the volume-weighted average prices for a share of Class A common stock for each of the three\nconsecutive full trading days ending on and including the last full trading day immediately prior to the related date of exchange. Class B Units are subject to\nvesting and a participation threshold, and, as a result, LLC Unitholders exchanging Class B Units will receive a number of shares of Class A common stock\nequal to the Class A common stock value (determined the same way as above) less the applicable participation threshold multiplied by 0.8 times the number\nof Class B Units being exchanged, divided by the same Class A common stock value, subject to adjustment as set forth in the Exchange Agreement.\nREGISTRATION R IGHTS AGREEMENT\nIn connection with the IPO, we entered into a registration rights agreement with certain LLC unitholders. These LLC unitholders are entitled to\nrequest that we register their shares on a long-form or short-form registration statement on one or more occasions in the future, which registrations may be\n“shelf registrations.” All of these LLC unitholders will be entitled to participate in certain of our\n- 40 -\nTable of Contents\nregistered offerings, subject to the restrictions in the registration rights agreement. We will pay expenses in connection with the exercise of these rights. The\nregistration rights described in this paragraph apply to (1) shares of our Class A common stock held by certain LLC unitholders, and (2) any of our capital\nstock (or that of our subsidiaries) issued or issuable with respect to the Class A common stock described in clause (1) with respect to any dividend, stock\nsplit, recapitalization, reorganization, or certain other corporate transactions (“Registrable Securities”). These registration rights are also for the benefit of\nany subsequent holder of Registrable Securities, provided that any particular securities will cease to be Registrable Securities when they have been sold in a\nregistered public offering, sold in compliance with Rule 144 of the Securities Act or repurchased by us or our subsidiaries. In addition, any Registrable\nSecurities held by a person other than an LLC Unitholder and their affiliates will cease to be Registrable Securities if they can be sold without limitation\nunder Rule 144 of the Securities Act.\nTAX REC EIVABLE AGREEMENT\nWe have entered into a Tax Receivable Agreement with LLC Unitholders that will provide for the payment from time to time by us to such\npersons of 85% of the amount of the benefits, if any, that we realize or, under certain circumstances, are deemed to realize as a result of\n1. the increase in our wholly owned subsidiary’s proportionate share of the existing tax basis of the assets of Carvana Group and an adjustment in\nthe tax basis of the assets of Carvana Group reflected in that proportionate share as a result of any future exchanges of LLC Units held by an\nLLC Unitholder for shares of our Class A common stock or cash, and\n2. certain other tax benefits related to our making payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement.\nWe expect to benefit from the remaining 15% of any tax benefits that we actually realize and, except in connection with a change in control, we will not\nmake any payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement until after we have directly or indirectly realized (or have been deemed to have realized) benefits\nin excess of such payments.

Services provided to Carvana and its subsidiaries by Grant Thornton LLP for the year ended December 31, 2018 are described below\nand under “Audit Committee Report.”\nFEES AND SERVICES\nThe following table summarizes the aggregate fees for professional audit services and other services rendered by Grant Thornton LLP for the\nyears ended December 31, 2018 and 2017:\nSERVICES 2018 2017\nAudit Fees $1,524,986(1) $1,061,451(3)\nAudit-Related Fees $ — $ —\nTax Fees $ 349,220(2) $ 110,489\nAll Other Fees $ — $ —\n(1) Includes the aggregate fees for the audit of our annual consolidated financial statements and internal controls, and the reviews of each of our quarterly\nconsolidated financial statements. These fees also include procedures performed related to our follow-on offering completed in April 2018,\nregistration of shares on Form S-3 in May and December 2018, and the issuance of our senior notes in September 2018.\n(2) Includes the aggregate fees for tax return preparation and other tax compliance services.\n(3) Includes $475,782 in fees related to our initial public offering in April 2017 that were reported in “All Other Fees” in our proxy statement prepared in\nconnection with our 2018 annual meeting of stockholders.\nIn considering the nature of the services provided by the independent auditor, the Audit Committee determined that such services are\ncompatible with the provision of independent audit services. The Audit Committee discussed these services with the independent auditor and Carvana\nmanagement to determine that they are permitted under the rules and regulations concerning auditor independence promulgated by the SEC to implement\nthe Sarbanes–Oxley Act of 2002, as well as the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants.\nThe Audit Committee has adopted a policy that requires advance approval of all audit services as well as non-audit services to the extent\nrequired by the Exchange Act and the Sarbanes–Oxley Act of 2002. Unless the specific service has been previously pre-approved with respect to that year,\nthe Audit Committee must approve the permitted service before the independent auditor is engaged to perform it.\nThe Audit Committee approved all services provided by Grant Thornton LLP. Representatives of Grant Thornton LLP are expected to be\npresent at the annual meeting. They will have the opportunity to make a statement if they desire to do so, and we expect that they will be available to\nrespond to questions.\n- 54 -\nTable of Contents\nRatification of the appointment of Grant Thornton LLP requires affirmative votes from the holders of a majority of the shares present in person\nor represented by proxy at the annual meeting and entitled to vote. If Carvana’s stockholders do not ratify the appointment of Grant Thornton LLP, the\nAudit Committee will reconsider the appointment and may affirm the appointment or retain another independent accounting firm. Even if the appointment\nis ratified, the Audit Committee may in the future replace Grant Thornton LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm if it is determined that\nit is in Carvana’s best interests to do so.\nThe Audit Committee and the Board of Directors recommend that you vote “FOR” the ratification of the appointment of Grant Thornton LLP as\nthe independent registered public accounting firm of Carvana for the year ending December 31, 2019.\n- 55 -\nTable of Contents\nA UDIT COMMITTEE REPORT\nThe Audit Committee oversees our financial reporting process on behalf of the Board. The Audit Committee is composed of three independent\ndirectors (as defined by the New York Stock Exchange Listing Standards), met nine times in 2018, and operates under a written charter, which is posted on\nour website at investors.carvana.com/corporate-governance/governance-documents. As provided in the charter, the Audit Committee’s oversight\nresponsibilities include monitoring the integrity of our financial statements (including reviewing financial information, the systems of internal controls, the\naudit process, and the independence and performance of our internal audit function and independent registered public accounting firm) and our compliance\nwith legal and regulatory requirements. However, management has the primary responsibility for the financial statements and the reporting process,\nincluding our systems of internal controls. In fulfilling its oversight responsibilities, the Audit Committee\n• reviewed and discussed the audited financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2018, with our management;\n• discussed with our independent auditors, Grant Thornton LLP, the matters required to be discussed by Public Company Accounting Oversight\nBoard (“PCAOB”) Auditing Standard No. 1301 (Communications with Audit Committees); and\n• received the written disclosures and the letter from Grant Thornton LLP required by applicable requirements of the PCAOB regarding Grant\nThornton LLP’s communications with the audit committee concerning independence, and has discussed with Grant Thornton LLP the\nindependence of Grant Thornton LLP.\nBased on the Audit Committee’s review and discussions noted above, the Audit Committee recommended to the Board of Directors that the\naudited financial statements be included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nRespectfully submitted by:\nIra Platt\nGregory Sullivan\nMichael Maroone\n- 56 -\nTable of Contents\nITEM 3 – SAY ON PAY\nWe are asking stockholders to approve, on an advisory basis, the compensation of our named executive officers as disclosed in the\n“Compensation Discussion and Analysis,” the “Summary Compensation Table,” and the related compensation tables and narrative. This item is being\npresented pursuant to Section 14A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Although this advisory vote is not binding, the Compensation and Nominating\nCommittee will consider the voting results when evaluating our executive compensation program.\nOur executive compensation programs are designed to support our long-term success and reflect our pay-for-performance culture. Our company\nhas grown dramatically over the years. Our growth has few historical precedents and makes us one of the fastest-growing technology, consumer, or retail\ncompanies at our scale, and in 2018 we continued to grow rapidly, with another year of triple-digit unit and revenue growth while simultaneously making\nsignificant progress in gross profit per unit and accelerating our operating leverage. We have a strong belief in promoting a pay-for-performance culture,\nand, accordingly, as described in the “Compensation Discussion and Analysis” of this proxy statement, the Compensation and Nominating Committee has\nset challenging performance targets based not on last year’s achievements but continued rapid growth, and has structured our executive compensation\nprogram to tie total compensation to long-term stockholder value, as reflected primarily in our stock price. We believe that our executive compensation\nplans effectively support our strategic and financial goals, create a culture of teamwork, and are directly tied to the performance of the company and\nshareholder outcomes.\nThe Board recommends a vote “FOR” approval, on an advisory basis, of our executive compensation as described in this proxy statement.\nITEM 4 – SAY ON PAY FREQUENCY\nPursuant to Section 14A of the Exchange Act, we are asking stockholders to cast an advisory vote on the frequency of future advisory votes on\nexecutive compensation. Stockholders may specify whether they prefer such votes to occur every year, every two years, or every three years, or they may\nabstain. The Board recommends that this vote occur every year.\nAlthough the stockholders’ vote on this proposal is not binding, the Board will consider the voting results in determining the frequency of\nfuture advisory votes. Notwithstanding the Board’s recommendation and the outcome of the stockholder vote, the Board may in the future decide to conduct\nadvisory votes on a more or less frequent basis and may vary its practice based on factors such as discussions with stockholders and the adoption of material\nchanges to compensation programs.\nThe Board recommends stockholders vote, on an advisory basis, to conduct future advisory votes on executive compensation every “ONE YEAR.”\n- 57 -\nTable of Contents\nOTHER MATTERS\nWe are not aware of any matters other than those discussed in the foregoing materials contemplated for action at the annual meeting. The\npersons named in the proxy card will vote in accordance with the recommendation of the Board on any other matters incidental to the conduct of, or\notherwise properly brought before, the annual meeting.

In connection with these contributions, we have made corresponding grants of 165 restricted stock units under our 2017 Omnibus Incentive\nPlan to each employee who has satisfied the requirements and intend to make grants to the remaining then-existing employees as they satisfy the\nrequirements (the “100k Milestone Gift” or “Gift”). Under U.S. GAAP, the 100k Milestone Gift is treated as compensation expense, a portion of which\nrelates to the production of our used vehicle inventory and is therefore capitalized to inventory and subsequently recognized within costs of sales when the\nrelated inventory is sold.\nNON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES\nTo supplement the consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP, we also present the\nfollowing non-GAAP measures: gross profit ex-Gift, gross profit per unit ex-Gift, EBITDA ex-Gift, and EBITDA margin ex-Gift. We believe the\npresentation of both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures provides investors with increased transparency into financial measures used by our\nmanagement team, and it also improves investors’ understanding of our underlying operating performance and their ability to analyze our ongoing operating\ntrends. All historic non-GAAP financial measures have been reconciled with the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures.\nGROSSPROFITEX-GIFTANDGROSSPROFITPERUNITEX-GIFT\nGross profit ex-Gift and gross profit per unit ex-Gift are non-GAAP supplemental measures of operating performance that do not represent and\nshould not be considered an alternative to gross profit, as determined by GAAP. Gross profit ex-Gift is defined as gross profit before compensation expense\nrelated to the 100k Milestone Gift included in cost of sales. Gross profit per Unit ex-Gift is Gross Profit ex-Gift divided by units sold. We use Gross Profit\nex-Gift to measure the operating performance of our business and Gross Profit per Unit ex-Gift to measure our operating performance relative to our units\nsold. We believe that Gross Profit ex-Gift and Gross Profit per Unit ex-Gift are useful measures to us and to our investors because they exclude the expense\nassociated with the 100k Milestone Gift recognized in cost of sales. We expect the 100k Milestone Gift to be a one-time award program for which we will\nrecognize varying amounts of expense beginning in the second half of 2018 and continuing through the first half of 2020, and therefore we believe the\nrelated expense does not reflect our core operations, is not included in our past operations, and may not be indicative of our future operations. Additionally,\nthe shares issued to settle the 100k Milestone Gift are offset by share contributions from Mr. Garcia to Carvana, therefore we expect the impact on shares\noutstanding to be nearly zero. We believe that excluding it enables us to more effectively evaluate our performance period-over-period and relative to our\ncompetitors.\n- 60 -\nTable of Contents\nA reconciliation of the gross profit ex-Gift amounts to each corresponding gross profit amount, which are the most directly comparable GAAP\nmeasures and include expenses attributable to the 100k Milestone Gift, and calculations of each gross profit per unit ex-Gift amount are as follows (dollars\nin thousands, except per unit amounts):\nYEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31,\n2018 2017 2016\nUsed vehicle gross profit $ 94,319 $32,806 $ 5,944\n100k Milestone Gift in used vehicle cost of sales 3,870 — —\nUsed vehicle gross profit ex-Gift $ 98,189 $32,806 $ 5,944\nUsed vehicle unit sales 94,108 44,252 18,761\nUsed vehicle gross profit per unit ex-Gift $ 1,043 $ 741 $ 317\nWholesale vehicle gross profit $ 5,552 $ 1,845 $ 257\n100k Milestone Gift in wholesale vehicle cost of sales 133 — —\nWholesale vehicle gross profit ex-Gift $ 5,685 $ 1,845 $ 257\nWholesale vehicle unit sales 15,125 6,509 2,651\nWholesale vehicle gross profit per unit ex-Gift $ 376 $ 283 $ 97\nTotal gross profit $196,709 $68,091 $19,197\n100k Milestone Gift in total cost of sales 4,003 — —\nTotal gross profit ex-Gift $200,712 $68,091 $19,197\nUsed vehicle unit sales 94,108 44,252 18,761\nTotal gross profit per unit ex-Gift $ 2,133 $ 1,539 $ 1,023\nEBITDAEX-GIFTANDEBITDAMARGINEX-GIFT\nEBITDA ex-Gift and EBITDA margin ex-Gift are non-GAAP supplemental measures of operating performance that do not represent and\nshould not be considered an alternative to net loss or cash flow from operations, as determined by GAAP. EBITDA ex-Gift is defined as net loss before\ninterest expense,\n- 61 -\nTable of Contents\nincome tax expense, depreciation and amortization expense, and the compensation expense related to the 100k Milestone Gift. EBITDA margin ex-Gift is\nEBITDA ex-Gift as a percentage of total revenues. We use EBITDA ex-Gift to measure the operating performance of our business and EBITDA Margin\nex-Gift to measure our operating performance relative to our total revenues. We believe that EBITDA ex-Gift and EBITDA margin ex-Gift are useful\nmeasures to us and to our investors because they exclude certain financial and capital structure items and the expense associated with the 100k Milestone\nGift that we do not believe directly reflect our core operations and may not be indicative of our recurring operations, in part because they may vary widely\nacross time and within our industry independent of the performance of our core operations. In particular, we expect the 100k Milestone Gift to be a\none-time award program for which we will recognize varying amounts of expense beginning in the second half of 2018 and continuing through the first half\nof 2020, and therefore we believe the related expense does not reflect our core operations, is not included in our past operations, and may not be indicative\nof our future operations. Additionally, the shares issued to settle the 100k Milestone Gift are offset by share contributions from Mr. Garcia to Carvana;\ntherefore, we expect the impact on shares outstanding to be nearly zero. We believe that excluding these items enables us to more effectively evaluate our\nperformance period-over-period and relative to our competitors. EBITDA ex-Gift and EBITDA margin ex-Gift may not be comparable to similarly titled\nmeasures provided by other companies due to potential differences in methods of calculations.

He is the author of Flesh and Machines.\n\nMathematicians and scientists are often limited in how they see the big picture, beyond\ntheir particular field, by the tools and metaphors they use in their work. Norbert Wiener\nis no exception, and I might guess that neither am I.\n\nWhen he wrote The Human Use of Human Beings, Wiener was straddling the end\nof the era of understanding machines and animals simply as physical processes and the\nbeginning of our current era of understanding machines and animals as computational\nprocesses. I suspect there will be future eras whose tools will look as distinct from the\ntools of the two eras Wiener straddled as those tools did from each other.\n\nWiener was a giant of the earlier era and built on the tools developed since the\ntime of Newton and Leibniz to describe and analyze continuous processes in the physical\nworld. In 1948 he published Cybernetics, a word he coined to describe the science of\ncommunication and control in both machines and animals. Today we would refer to the\nideas in this book as control theory, an indispensable discipline for the design and\nanalysis of physical machines, while mostly neglecting Wiener’s claims about the science\nof communication. Wiener’s innovations were largely driven by his work during the\nSecond World War on mechanisms to aim and fire anti-aircraft guns. He brought\nmathematical rigor to the design of the sorts of technology whose design processes had\nbeen largely heuristic in nature: from the Roman waterworks through Watt’s steam\nengine to the early development of automobiles.\n\nOne can imagine a different contingent version of our intellectual and\ntechnological history had Alan Turing and John von Neumann, both of whom made\nmajor contributions to the foundations of computing, not appeared on the scene. Turing\ncontributed a fundamental model of computation—now known as a Turing Machine—in\nhis paper “On Computable Numbers with an Application to the Entscheidungsproblem,”\nwritten and revised in 1936 and published in 1937. In these machines, a linear tape of\nsymbols from a finite alphabet encodes the input for a computational problem and also\nprovides the working space for the computation. A different machine was required for\neach separate computational problem; later work by others would show that in one\nparticular machine, now known as a Universal Turing Machine, an arbitrary set of\ncomputing instructions could be encoded on that same tape.\n\nIn the 1940s, von Neumann developed an abstract self-reproducing machine\ncalled a cellular automaton. In this case it occupied a finite subset of an infinite two-\ndimensional array of squares each containing a single symbol from a finite alphabet of\ntwenty-nine distinct symbols—the rest of the infinite array starts out blank. The single\nsymbols in each square change in lockstep, based on a complex but finite rule about the\ncurrent symbol in that square and its immediate neighbors. Under the complex rule that\nvon Neumann developed, most of the symbols in most of the squares stay the same and a\nfew change at each step. So when one looks at the non-blank squares, it appears that\n\n50\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_016853\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

On the contrary, a principal purpose of my chapter is to show that\n\n1. one purpose of protecting these individuals had been to protect a valued intelligence connection\n(the \"al-Qaeda connection,” if you will);\n\n2. one major intention of the 9/11 Commission Report was to continue protecting this connection;\n\n3. those on the 9/11 Commission staff who were charged with this protection included at least one\ncommission member (Jamie Gorelick), one staff member (Dietrich Snell), and one important witness\n(Patrick Fitzgerald) who earlier had figured among the terrorists’ protectors.\n\nIn the course of writing this chapter [Scott continues], | came to another disturbing conclusion | had\nnot anticipated.

In reality, as | shall show, royal family\nprotection from Qatar and Saudi Arabia (concealed by the 9/11 Commission) was repeatedly given\nto key figures like Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, the alleged “principal architect of the 9/11 attacks.” The\nestablishment claims that the wars fought by America in Asia since 9/11 have been part of a global\n“war on terror.” But this “war on terror” has been fought in alliance with Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and\nPakistan - precisely the principal political and financial backers of the al-Qaedist networks the United\nStates has supposedly been fighting. Meanwhile the most authentic opponents in the region of these\nSunni al-Qaedists - the governments of Iraq, Libya, Syria, and Iran - have found themselves\noverthrown (in the case of Iraq and Libya), subverted with U.S. support (in the case of Syria), or\nsanctioned and threatened as part of an “axis of evil” (in the case of Iran). We should not forget that,\njust one day after 9/11, “Rumsfeld was talking about broadening the objectives of our response and\n‘getting Iraq.”\n\n(pp. 44-45, The American Deep State)\n\nClinton's daughter is now poised to work global health initiatives which | would suggest is little more\nthan a cover for on-going terrorism \"ops\".\n\nTo return to Steve Colo - in the interview he speaks of a partnership between the Secret Service, the\nFBI, and South Carolina's SLED (State Law Enforcement Division) to open a Computer Crime\nCenter. Bud Horton (mentioned above) (long-affiliated with IT Security; his title at Accenture was\nChief technology officer of it's cyber security practice) happened to have just moved to South\nCarolina from Loudoun County after being implicated in a continuing child sex scandal (see details\nbelow).

I finished among the top two dozen results in the country.\n“How can you throw your gifts away? For what,” he asked me. “If you leave\nthat school, and give up on going to university, it will be like betraying\nyourself.” At one point, he walked me out to the patch of hard-packed soil\nwhere we parked the tractors and farm machinery. “What do you want to do\nwith your life,” he asked. “Do you want to be a farmer?”\n\nI thought about it before answering. “I don’t know what will happen in the\nfuture,” I said. “But if you ask me now, I would say I want to drive one of the\nkibbutz trucks.”\n\nI could see the shock and disappointment in his eyes. But it was the truth. I\ndid imagine that at some point I might want to make a life outside the kibbutz.\nBut I’d never lived anywhere else. If I was going to remain a part of it, I could\nthink of no better way than to join our little corps of drivers. Though they lived\non the kibbutz, they spent most of their time delivering or picking up goods in\nplaces like Tel Aviv, Holon or Ashkelon. As the US Marines might have put it,\nI guess I figured I’d join the truck-drivers and see the world.\n\nThe deeper reason I said no to my father, as I am sure he suspected, was that\nI felt a need to take control of my own life. That was simply a part of growing\nup, a process which probably happened more quickly for 1950s kibbutz children\nthan for town or city kids. We loved and respected our parents. But we were\nliving with other teenagers. We weren’t just residents of the kibbutz. We were\npart of the economic collective, working in the fields or orchards, the garage\nand the metal shop. This bred a sense of independence. I listened to my father’s\narguments. But this was a decision about my future. I felt I had to make it for\nmyself. I cared about my education. But I’d reached a stage where my life\noutside the classroom, and my circle of friends, mattered more. I am sure that\nthe same impulse drove me in my continuing freelance forays into lockpicking\nand petty larceny with Ido and Moshe.\n\nSo I returned to the kibbutz school. The level of teaching was nowhere near\nthe regional school’s. But we did begin studying new subjects like economics\nand politics. There were two other welcome surprises as well. The first was the\narrival of a new history teacher. Knowledgable, enthusiastic and eloquent, he\nhad a rare gift for igniting excitement in his students. We studied the French\nRevolution. He brought it to life with insights into Montesquieu, Rousseau and\nJohn Locke, Louis XVI and Mary Antoinette, Robespierre and Napoleon. He\ntraced the dynamics that led to the revolution, and the way its ideals descended\ninto the bloodshed and terror that followed. He presented history as a human\n\n42\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_011513\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

They themselves are proud of their culture, and yet\nthere's one anti-HIV slogan that always leaps out at me when I spot it among the myriad\nof posters and stickers:\n\nThere is nothing cultural about dying of AIDS.\n\nte Ok ok\n\nThe original version of this article can be found on the Internet, but please note that I've\ndone some editing for clarity.

I think a lot of people would like to believe that Africans are \"different\nfrom us\" and that's why HIV has had such an impact in Africa. And it's accurate to say\nthat certain cultural patterns influence the spread of HIV, as I described in the previous\npiece, \"Be Faithful.\"\n\nBut the truth is, also, that people are similar everywhere: we respond to certain\nincentives, and sexuality is one of our most powerful incentives. The terrifying truth is\nthat Africans are not especially different from us... and given the right circumstances, the\nWest can and will be equally vulnerable to this awful epidemic. And as I learned more\nand then came home, I began to see just how vulnerable we are. There are poor,\nmarginalized areas of the USA where HIV is reaching the same proportions that it has\nreached in Africa. And even among privileged young Americans, HIV rates have been\nrising for the first time in years.\n\nte Ok ok\n\nSexual ABCs in Africa, Part 3: Condoms\n\nIn America, the common argument against explicit sex education -- and promoting\ncondom use in schools -- is that it will encourage kids to be promiscuous. The idea is that\nif we portray it as normal for kids to be having sex and tell them how to do it safely,\nthey'll be more likely to go and have sex.

SCOTT \n\"Inside Job,\" a sleek, briskly paced film whose title suggests a heist movie, is the story of a crime \nwithout punishment, of an outrage that has so far largely escaped legal sanction and societal stigma. The \nbetrayal of public trust and collective values that Mr. Ferguson chronicles was far more brazen and \ndamaging than the adultery in Nathaniel Hawthorne's novel, which treated Hester more as scapegoat than \nvillain. \nThe gist of this movie, which begins in a mood of calm reflection and grows angrier and more incredulous \nas it goes on, is unmistakably punitive. The density of information and the complexity of the subject \nmatter make \"Inside Job\" feel like a classroom lecture at times, but by the end Mr. Ferguson has summoned \nthe scourging moral force of a pulpit-shaking sermon. That he delivers it with rigor, restraint and good \nhumor makes his case all the more devastating. \nHe is hardly alone in making it. Numerous journalists have published books and articles retracing the \npaths that led the world economy to the precipice two years ago. The deregulation of the financial \nservices industry in the 1980s and '90s; the growing popularity of complex and risky derivatives; the \nreal estate bubble and the explosion of subprime lending — none of these developments were exactly \nsecret. On the contrary, they were celebrated as vindications of the power and wisdom of markets. \nAccordingly, Mr. Ferguson recycles choice moments of triumphalism, courtesy of Lawrence H. Summers, \nGeorge W. Bush, Alan Greenspan and various cable television ranters and squawkers. \nEven as stock indexes soared and profits swelled, there were always at least a few investors, economists \nand government officials who warned that the frenzied speculation was leading to the abyss. Some of these \nprophets without honor show up in front of Mr. Ferguson's camera, less to gloat than to present, once \nagain, the analyses that were dismissed and ignored by their peers for so long. \nDozens of interviews — along with news clips and arresting aerial shots of New York, Iceland and other \ndisaster areas — are folded into a clear and absorbing history, narrated by Matt Damon. The music (an \nopening song, \"Big Time,\" by Peter Gabriel, and a score by Alex Heffes) and the clean wide-screen \ncinematography provide an aesthetic polish that is welcome for its own sake and also important to the \nmovie's themes. The handsomely lighted and appointed interiors convey a sense of the rarefied, privileged \nworlds in which the Wall Street operators and their political enablers flourished, and the elegance of \nthe presentation also subliminally bolsters the film's authority. This is not a piece of ragged \nmuckraking or breathless advocacy. It rests its outrage on reason, research and careful argument. \nThe same was true of Mr. Ferguson's previous documentary, \"No End in Sight,\" which focused on \ncatastrophic policies carried out in Iraq by President George W. Bush's administration just after the \noverthrow of Saddam Hussein. But whereas that film concentrated on a narrow view of a complex subject — \nthe conduct of the war rather than the at least equally controversial rationale for fighting it — \"Inside \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 031986 \nJob\" offers a sweeping synthesis, going as far back as the Reagan administration and as far afield as \nIceland in its anatomy of the financial crisis. \nPerhaps unsurprisingly, many of the highest-profile players declined to be interviewed. Mr. Summers \nappears only in news footage, and none of his predecessors or successors as Treasury secretary — not \nRobert E. Rubin or Henry M. Paulson Jr. or Timothy F. Geithner — submit to Mr. Ferguson's questions. Nor \ndo any of the top executives at Goldman Sachs or the other big banks. Most of the interviewees are, at \nleast from the perspective of the filmmaker, friendly witnesses, adding fuel to the director's \ncomprehensive critique of the way business has been done in the United States and the other advanced \ncapitalist countries for the past two decades. \nBoth American political parties are indicted; \"Inside Job\" is not simply another belated settling of \naccounts with Mr. Bush and his advisers, though they are hardly ignored. The scaling back of government \noversight and the weakening of checks on speculative activity by banks began under Reagan and continued \nduring the Clinton administration. And with each administration the market in derivatives expanded, and \nalarms about the dangers of this type of investment were ignored. Raghuram Rajan, chief economist at the \nInternational Monetary Fund, presented a paper in 2005 warning of a \"catastrophic meltdown\" and was \nmocked as a \"Luddite\" by Mr. Summers. \nMeanwhile, some investment bankers — at Goldman Sachs in particular — were betting against the positions \nthey were pushing on their customers. An elaborate house of cards had been constructed in which bad \nconsumer loans were bundled into securities, which, were certified as sound by rating agencies paid by \nthe banks and then insured via credit-default swaps. One risky bet was stacked on top of another, and in \nretrospect the collapse of the whole edifice, along with the loss of jobs, homes, pensions and political \nconfidence, seems inevitable. \nHow did this happen? Mr. Ferguson is no conspiracy theorist; nor is he inclined toward structural or \nsystemic explanations. Markets are not like tectonic plates, shifting on their own. Visible hands write \nlaws and make deals, and in this case a combination of warped values and groupthink seems to have driven \nvery intelligent men (and they were mostly men) toward folly. In addition to business and government, Mr. \nFerguson aims his critique at academia, suggesting that the discipline of economics and more than a few \nprominent economists were corrupted by consulting fees, seats on boards of directors and membership in \nthe masters of the universe club. \nWhen he challenges some of these professors, in particular those who held positions of responsibility in \nthe White House or in the Federal Reserve, they are reduced to stammering obfuscation — Markets are \ncomplicated! Who could have predicted? I don't see any conflict of interest — and occasionally provoked \nto testiness. Mr. Ferguson, for his part, cannot always contain his incredulity or rein in his sarcasm. \nOccasionally his voice pipes up from off camera, saying things like, \"You can't be serious!\" \nBut it is hard to imagine a movie more serious, and more urgent, than \"Inside Job.\" There are a few \navenues that might have been explored more thoroughly, in particular the effects of the crisis on \nordinary, non-Wall-Street-connected workers and homeowners. The end of the film raises a disturbing \nquestion, as Mr. Damon exhorts viewers to demand changes in the status quo so that the trends associated \nwith unchecked speculation of the kind that caused the last crisis — rising inequality, neglect of \nproductive capacity, endless cycles of boom and bust — might be reversed. \nThis call to arms makes you wonder why anger of the kind so eloquently expressed in \"Inside Job\" has been \nso inchoate. And through no fault of its own, the film may leave you dispirited as well as enraged. Its \nfate is likely to be that of other documentaries: praised in some quarters, nitpicked in others and \nshrugged off by those who need its message most. Which is a shame. \n\"Inside Job\" is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). Some drug and sex references and pervasive \nobscenity, though not the verbal kind. \n*********************************************************** \nThe information contained in this communication is \nconfidential, may be attorney-client privileged, may \nconstitute inside information, and is intended only for \nthe use of the addressee.

The bureaucratic swamp, the intelligence agencies, the unfair courts,\nthe lying media—they were all lined up against him. This was, for his senior staff, a\nreliable topic of conversation with him: the possible martyrdom of Donald Trump.\n\nIn the president’s nighttime calls, he kept coming back to how unfair this was, and to\nwhat Tony Blair had said—and others, too! It all added up. There was a plot against him.\n\nNow, it was certainly true that Trump’s closest staff appreciated his volatility, and, to a\nperson, was alarmed by it. At points on the day’s spectrum of adverse political\ndevelopments, he could have moments of, almost everyone would admit, irrationality.\nWhen that happened, he was alone in his anger and not approachable by anyone. His\nsenior staff largely dealt with these dark hours by agreeing with him, no matter what he\nsaid. And if some of them occasionally tried to hedge, Hope Hicks never did. She agreed\nabsolutely with all of it.\n\nAt Mar-a-Lago on the evening of March 3, the president watched Bret Baier interview\nPaul Ryan on Fox. Baier asked the Speaker about a report on the online news site Circa—\nowned by Sinclair, the conservative broadcast group—involving allegations that Trump\nTower had been surveilled during the campaign.\n\nOn March 4, Trump’s early morning tweets began:\n\nTerrible!

This was pure public\nexclamation, a window into pain and frustration. With his misspellings and his use of\n1970s lingo—“wire tapping” called up an image of FBI agents crouched in a van on Fifth\nAvenue—it seemed kooky and farcical. Of the many tweets that Trump had seemed to\nhoist himself by, from the point of view of the media, intelligence community, and\nextremely satisfied Democrats, the wiretap tweets had pulled him highest and most left\nhim dangling in ignorance and embarrassment.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_020002\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

In a world of “work harder, not smarter,” it came to pass that his coaches felt he was spending\ntoo much time on his business and not enough time in training, despite his results.\n\nRather than choose between his business or his dream, Dale chose to move laterally with both, from\neither/or to both/and. He wasn’t spending too much time on his business; he and his brother were\nspending too much time with Canucks.\n\nIn 2002, they moved to the ski capital of the world, Australia, where the team was smaller, more\nflexible, and coached by a legend. Three short years later, he received citizenship, went head-to-head\nagainst former teammates, and became the third “Aussie” in history to win winter gold.\n\nIn the land of wallabies and big surf, Dale has since gone postal.

KENNEDY\n\nSome people remain convinced that just a bit more money will make things right. Their goals are\n\narbitrary moving targets: $300,000 in the bank, $1,000,000 in the portfolio, $100,000 a year instead of\n$50,000, etc. Julie’s goal made intrinsic sense: come back with the same number of children she had left\nwith.\n\nShe reclined in her seat and glanced across the aisle past her sleeping husband, Marc, counting as she\nhad done thousands of times—one, two, three. So far so good. In 12 hours, they would all be back in\nParis, safe and sound. That was assuming the plane from New Caledonia held together, of course.\n\nNew Caledonia?\n\nNestled in the tropics of the Coral Sea, New Caledonia was a French territory and where Julie and\nMarc had just sold the sailboat that took them 15,000 miles around the world. Of course, recouping their\ninitial investment had been part of the plan. All said and done, their 15-month exploration of the globe,\nfrom the gondola-rich waterways of Venice to the tribal shores of Polynesia, had cost between $18,000\nand $19,000. Less than rent and baguettes in Paris.\n\nMost people would consider this impossible. Then again, most people don’t know that more than 300\nfamilies set sail from France each year to do the same.\n\nThe trip had been a dream for almost two decades, relegated to the back of the line behind an ever-\ngrowing list of responsibilities. Each passing moment brought a new list of reasons for putting it off. One\nday, Julie realized that if she didn’t do it now, she would never do it. The rationalizations, legitimate or\nnot, would just continue to add up and make it harder to convince herself that escape was possible.\n\nOne year of preparation and one 30-day trial run with her husband later, they set sail on the trip of a\nlifetime. Julie realized almost as soon as the anchor lifted that, far from being a reason not to travel and\nseek adventure, children are perhaps the best reason of all to do both.\n\nPre-trip, her three little boys had fought like banshees at the drop of a hat. In the process of learning to\ncoexist in a floating bedroom, they learned patience, as much for themselves as for the sanity of their\nparents. Pre-trip, books were about as appealing as eating sand. Given the alternative of staring at a wall\non the open sea, all three learned to love books. Pulling them out of school for one academic year and\nexposing them to new environments had proven to be the best investment in their education to date.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_013816\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

We need the Mubaraks of\nthe world and they need us. Fine, but relentlessly keep the pressure on\nthem to improve their rule.

One was a Yale, the other an Israeli-made lookalike called a\nNabob. One evening after dinner, I searched the ground around the kibbutz\ngarage for shards of metal that looked like they might fit into the key slot, and\nspent the next half-hour or so propped against a tree, trying and failing to coax\neither lock to open. I realized I would need to discover how the locks worked.\nBut how to get inside to see?\n\nSaturday afternoons in Mishmar Hasharon were a quiet time, like the old\nJewish neighborhoods and shtetls back in Europe but minus the religious\ntrappings. The next day, I waited until mid-afternoon and walked past the\nbakery towards the garage. Its roll-down, corrugated door was locked. So was\nthe structure next to it, where the blacksmith and metalwork shop were. But\nattached to the blacksmith’s was a hut where our scrap metal was dumped. I\ndoubted it would be locked, and it wasn’t. Pausing to let my eyes get used to the\ndark, I made my way into the metalwork area. I crossed to the cabinet where the\ntools were kept. I took out a steel jigsaw used for cutting through metal and,\nhiding it under my shirt, made my way out again.\n\nFortunately, the saw was up to the task of cutting into the softer alloy that\nmade up the body of the locks. Once I’d cut inside them, I saw they shared the\nsame basic construction. There was a series of springs and shafts which, in\nresponse to the indentations of a key, aligned in such a way to allow the lock to\nopen. I sneaked back into the metalwork shop five or six times. By trial and\nerror, I managed to shape one of jigsaw blades into a pick tool that seemed like\nit should do the job. For days, I manipulated it into each of the padlocks. I knew\nI had the principle right, but I still couldn’t get it to work. Blisters formed on my\nthumb and fingers. Then, finally, the Yale sprung open! With each successive\ntry I got better at knowing how to put the blade in, when and where to rotate it\nand how much pressure to apply. After fashioning a half-dozen other tools, each\nslightly different in width and shape, I reached a point where I could get the\nmechanism to work on my first try. Other locks — doors, trunks, closets — were\neven easier after I made picks for them as well.\n\nI couldn’t resist sharing my newly acquired skill with a couple of the boys in\nmy class, and word gradually spread. There was a handful of slightly older boys\nwho we referred to as the “rogues”. They weren’t delinquents. They were free\nspirits, bridling at the uniform expectations and rules of kibbutz life. Over the\nnext few years, as co-conspirators more than close friends, I found myself\ndrawn to two of them. Ido and Moshe were 18 months older than me.

Epstein used his mathematical knowledge to develop complex \nformulae that could be applied to financial markets, especially in the \narea of currency exchange. He went on to form his own company and \nbegan advising Leslie Wexner, the billionaire creator of the Limited \nBrands group, which owns, among other extremely successful \ncompanies, Victoria's Secret and La Senza. Some on Wall Street believe \nthat Wexner is the source of Epstein's fortune, although the version \nEpstein seems to prefer is that he advises a number of very rich clients. \nIntriguingly, he is said to have a permit to carry a gun. Epstein's talents \nare not restricted to mathematics. He plays the piano to concert \nstandard (there is a nine-foot Steinway grand in his house) and he \ncultivates Nobel Prize-winning scientists with whom he engages \nin arcane conversation.. . \n'Ghislaine was totally in thrall to him,' Rupert \nFairfax said:. Ile death of her father left a terrible \ngap in her lifeand Jeffrey-filled it. I remember seeing \nthem together in Aspen. Jeffrey was everything to \nher. He lifted her up at a time when she was very \ndown.' C4hislainfrfriends have asserted tharshe \ndesperately wanted to marry Epstein, but that their \nromance turned into what one has described as 'an \naffectionate business relationship'. Epstein provided \nGhislaine with a home, a beaux-arts townhouse on \nthe Upper Fast Side close to his own residence. He \nalso gave her the wherewithal to run it in a grand \nmanner; she employed a substantial staff, including a \nfull-time butler and maid who had their own \nquarters at the property. Ghislaine appeared effortlessly to establish \nherself as one of New York's leading socialites. Witness, for instance, the \nparty she threw for Allegra Hicks, the designer ex-wife ofAshley Hicks, a \ngrandson of Earl Mountbatten and second cousin of the Prince of Wales. \nThe 80 guests at Ghislaine's house included Hollywood actor Matthew \nModine, at least one Rockefeller, a Radziwill and numerous \nbillionaires. After toasting the future of Allegra's new shop in New York \nwith vintage Dom Perignon, Ghislaine took her guests to the library, \nwhere the books had been given fake spines with titles naming her \nfriends. The party, like many she hosted, was a triumph and her success \ngave the slightly gauche Epstein a social entree that had thus far eluded \nhim. She is credited with helping him forge a friendship with Bill \nClinton, among other figures of influence. \nBut even Epstein could scarcely have imagined she would create an \nopportunity for friendship with a member of the British royal family — \nPrince Andrew, whom she appears to have met in London when he was \n`Ghislaine was \ntotally in thrall \nto him. The death \nof her father left \na terrible gap in \nher life and Jeffrey \nfilled it' \nworking at the Minstry of Defence. At the turn of the millennium, \nGhislaine and Andrew were hardly ever apart, enjoying eight different \njaunts together in the space of a year. In February 2000, they holidayed \nin Palm Beach. Then they travelled to New York for a fashion show. A \nmonth later, Andrew was back in New York at a fundraiser for the \nLondon Symphony Orchestra, again accompanied by Ghislaine. A few \nweeks after that, Andrew returned for another round of socialising with \nGhislaine. The following month, they met up for another holiday in \nFlorida. In the autumn, Andrew flew to New York, where he and \nGhislaine were spotted together. Just before Christmas, Andrew gave a \nhouse party at Sandringham to mark Ghislaine's 39th birthday. A few \nweeks later, in January 2001, they were on holiday again, in Phuket. • \nWhat was going on? Was it a romance? No, said informed sources. \nBecause on at least five of the eight occasions when Andrew and \nGhislaine were together, Jeffrey Epstein was there as \nwell. Andrew invited them both to Windsor for the \nQueen's birthday party. One of Epstein's friends, \nNobel Prize-winning scientist Murray Gell-Mann, \nsaid he understood that Epstein had given the \nQueen financial advice. \nAfter almost 10 years together, Ghislaine had \nbecome what Epstein characterised as his 'best \nfriend'. He once denied that she was on his payroll, \nbut ratiainquiries suggest that her financial \ninfireadiliLdirectly back to Epstein.4 1995 a \ncompany called Ghislainwas registered in \nFlorida, with offices at Epstein's Palm Beach \naddress. Whenever Ghislaine is asked what she \ndoes, she says she is managing director of a company calleddiftiork \nilleirnamb Not much is known about this company except that, \naccording to records, it is in the business of investment counselling. \nThat is Epstein's area of expertise and closer inspection shows that New \nYork Strategy Group is just another part of his financial empire. So if \nGhislaine really does work for Epstein, what does she do? \nThere is, in fact, a clue buried in the court documentation from \nPennsylvania. In 2003 a writ was filed by Nelson Shanks, the celebrated \nportraitist whose sitters have included Pope John Paul II, Ronald \nReagan and Diana, Princess of Wales. Shanks claimed that he had been \nhired to paint the clothing billionairelkesliellair his wife Abigail \nand their children. Yet when Shanks finished the picture, Wexner \nrefused to pay for it, owing $339,000. When Shanks sued for his money \n— successfully, .gs.it turned out — he also named Jeffrey Epstein and \nGhislaine Maxwell. It was Ghislaine, he said; who hadapproached him \nand arranged the deal with Wexner. Epstein wa.S also involved, he said.

These are not everyday affairs in the party’s deliberations on the great\nquestions of China’s unfolding global engagement.\n\nThese conferences are major, authoritative gatherings of the entire leadership, designed to\nsynthesise China’s official analysis of international trends, and assess how China should\nanticipate and respond to them in the prosecution of its own national interests. This one, like\nthe last one, was presided over by Xi Jinping and attended by all seven members of the\npolitburo standing committee, plus ex-officio member Vice President Wang Qishan, together\nwith all other eighteen members of the regular politburo, in addition to everybody who is\nanybody in the entire Chinese foreign, security, military, economic, trade, finance, cyber and\nintelligence community, as well as the central think tank community.\n\nIt’s a meeting that’s meant to be noticed by the entire Chinese international policy\nestablishment, because if there is to be any new directive concerning China’s place in the\nworld, it’s likely to be found somewhere in Xi Jinping’s 3,000 character report to this\nconference.\n\nOf course, the entire deliberations of the conference are not made public. Three-and-a-half\nyears ago, only a selected part of it was broadcast and reported in the central media. The\nsame this time as well.

We need to rethink our priorities with the help of the passionate\nbut flawed analyses of Wiener, Weizenbaum, and the other serious critics of our\ntechnophilia. A key phrase, it seems to me, is Wiener’s almost offhand observation,\nabove, that “these machines” are “helpless by themselves.” As I have been arguing\nrecently, we’re making tools, not colleagues, and the great danger is not appreciating the\ndifference, which we should strive to accentuate, marking and defending it with political\nand legal innovations.\n\nPerhaps the best way to see what is being missed 1s to note that Alan Turing\nhimself suffered an entirely understandable failure of imagination in his formulation of\nthe famous Turing Test. As everyone knows, it is an adaptation of his “imitation game,”\nin which a man, hidden from view and communicating verbally with a judge, tries to\nconvince the judge that he is in fact a woman, while a woman, also hidden and\ncommunicating with the judge, tries to convince the judge that she is the woman. Turing\nreasoned that this would be a demanding challenge for a man (or for a woman pretending\nto be a man), exploiting a wealth of knowledge about how the other sex thinks and acts,\nwhat they tend to favor or ignore. Surely (ding!)?, any man who could beat a woman at\nbeing perceived to be a woman would be an intelligent agent. What Turing did not\nforesee is the power of deep-learning AI to acquire this wealth of information in an\nexploitable form without having to understand it. Turing imagined an astute and\nimaginative (and hence conscious) agent who cunningly designed his responses based on\nhis detailed “theory” of what women are likely to do and say. Top-down intelligent\ndesign, in short. He certainly didn’t think that a man, winning the imitation game, would\nsomehow become a woman; he imagined that there would still be a man’s consciousness\nguiding the show. The hidden premise in Turing’s almost-argument was: Only a\nconscious, intelligent agent could devise and control a winning strategy in the imitation\ngame. And so it was persuasive to Turing (and others, including me, still a stalwart\ndefender of the Turing Test) to argue that a “computing machine” that could pass as\nhuman in a contest with a human might not be conscious in just the way a human being\nis, but would nevertheless have to be a conscious agent of some kind. I think this is still a\ndefensible position—the only defensible position—but you have to understand how\nresourceful and ingenious a judge would have to be to expose the shallowness of the\nfacade that a deep-learning AI (a tool, not a colleague) could present.\n\nWhat Turing didn’t foresee is the uncanny ability of superfast computers to sift\nmindlessly through Big Data, of which the Internet provides an inexhaustible supply,\nfinding probabilistic patterns in human activity that could be used to pop “authentic’-\nseeming responses into the output for almost any probe a judge would think to offer.\nWiener also underestimates this possibility, seeing the tell-tale weakness of a machine in\nnot being able to\n\ntake into account the vast range of probability that characterizes the human\nsituation.

Revolution is not the deus ex machina that will make\nthe world peaceful; it is a tsunami that sweeps everything before it,\nand often leaves the world messier and more dangerous.\n\nModern history teaches two great lessons about revolution: that\nrevolutions are inevitable, and that a large majority of revolutions\neither fail or go bad. Americans almost instinctively look at\nrevolutions in terms of our own past: the 1688 Glorious Revolution\nthat made Parliament more powerful than the King in England, and\nthe American Revolution that led in relatively short order to the\nestablishment of a stable and constitutional government.\n\nMost revolutions don’t work like this at all. Many of them fail, with\nthe old despots crushing dissent or making only cosmetic changes to\nthe old system. (This happened in Austria in 1848 and something\nvery like it may be happening in Egypt today.) Others move into\nradicalism, terror and mob rule before a new despot comes along to\nbring order — at least until the next futile and bloody revolutionary\nspasm. That was France’s history for almost 100 years after the\nstorming of the Bastille. China, Russia and Iran all saw revolutions\nlike this in the 20th century.\n\nThe revolutions that ‘work’ are the exceptions, not the rule. The\npeaceful revolutions in the Central European countries as Soviet\npower melted in 1989-1990 are a unique exception to the rule that\nmost revolutions either turn nasty or fail.

Representing two alleged victims identified only as Jane Doe#3 and Jane \noe #4, Edwards filed a motion in U.S. District Court in West Palm Beach that alleges well-known criminal defense lawyer Alan Dershowitz and Prince Andrew, the Duke of York, \nere involved in Epstein's international sex ring. \n'There's absolutelyno kemel of truth to this story,\" said Dershowitz, who represented Epstein. \"I don't know this woman. I've never been inthe same place with her. She's made up \nhe whole story completely from whole cloth.\" \ndwards' motionrequests that his new clients jointhe case of two other alleged victims — identified as Jane Doe #1 and Jane Doe#2 in courtrecords — who are attempting to use the \nme Victims' Rights Act to force the U.S. Department of Justice to prosecute Epstein for sex trafficking of children by fraud and use of interstate commerce to entice a minor to \nommit prostitution, among other offenses. \nwealthy Wall Streetmoney manager who had once attempted to purchase New York magazine, Epstein traveled the world in circles that included President Bill Clinton and \nusinessman Donald Trump. Despite his vast fortune and mansion in PalmBeach, Epstein kept a low profile and wasn't a regular inthe wealthy island's social scene. \nhe low profile vanished in 2005, when a woman contacted the Palm Beach police fearing that Epstein had molestedher 14-year-old daughter. The girl told detectives she'd been \nnvited to Epstein's mansion, where she was paid $300 after stripping to her underwear and massaging Epstein as he masturbated. Police then located a community college student \nwho gave a sworn statement that she had taken six girls, all betweenthe ages of 14 and 16, to Epstein. \nolice referred the case to the FBI. In September 2007, Dershowitz helped Epstein negotiate a then-secret non-prosecu on agreement with the U.S. Attorney's Office, which deferred \no the Palm Beach County State Attorney's Office for criminal charges, courtrecords show. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 028921 \nLINKEDIN \nhttp://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/community/miami- dadeiarticle5342709.html Page 1 of 3 \nSalacious new chapter n Florida billionaire's sex scandal I The Miami Herald 1/2/15 6:11 PM \nIn 2008, Epstein pleaded guilty to a state charge of solicitingprostitution with a minor and served 13 months of an 18-month sentence. \nAfter his conviction, Epstein's story grew even more bizarre, with anonymous women accusinghim in federal court of conspiring with Ghislaine Maxwell, daughter of the late British \nmediabaron Robert Maxwell, to operate an international underage sex ring. \nEdwards, the Fort Lauderdale lawyer, and Paul Cassell, a former federal judge who now teaches law at the University of Utah, filed a Jane Doe lawsuit against the U.S. government in \nJuly 2008, alleging that Epstein had committed crimes against their clients, including sex trafficking of children by fraud. \nThe case, whichhas been pending for more than sixyears before U.S. District JudgeKenneth A. Marra, initially involved two women, identified as Jane Doe#1 and Jane Doe #2, who \nsaid they were sexually abused by Epstein and trafficked as minors. \nOn Dec.30, 2014, Edwards asked to have two new accusers added to the case —identified as Jane Doe #3 and Jane Doe #4. \nJane Doe#3 alleges inthe court filing that Maxwell and Epstein kept her as a \"sex slave\" from 1999 through20002, when she escaped to an unspecified foreign country. \nEpstein forced Jane Doe#3, who was then a minor, to have sex with politically connected and wealthy people , the court filing alleges. \n\"Epstein's purpose in 'lending' Jane Doe [along with otheryoung girls] to such powerful people [was] to ingratiate himself with them for business, personal, political and financial \ngain, as well as to obtain blackmail information,\" the filing alleges. \nJane Doe#3 identifies one of the men she was forced to have sex with as Dershowitz, a former Harvard lawprofessorandhigh- profile criminal defense lawyer. \n\"Dershowitz was an eye-witnesstothe sexual abuse of many other minors by Epstein and several of Epste n's co-conspirators ,\" the filing alleges. \nDershowitz denied the claims, describing them as part of an extortionplot. He called the filing \"the sleaziest legal document I have ever seen.\" \n\"They manipulated a young, suggestible woman who was interested inmoney,\" Dershowitz said. \nDershowitz said he intends to file complaints against Edwards and Cassell. \"This is a disbarrable offense, and they will be disbarred,\" Dershowitz said. \"They will rue the day they ever \nmade this false charge againstme.\" \nKnowingly making defamatory statements in courtrecords can be grounds for disbarment. Jack Thompson, a Miami lawyer who campaigned against violent video games and the \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 028922 \ngroup 2 Live Crew, was disbarred forprofess onal misconduct that included making defamatory statements. \n\"We're not comment ngon the story beyond our legal pleading,\" Cassel said. \nIn the most recent court filing, Jane Doe #3 alleges that Epstein forced her to have sex with \"many otherpowerful men, including numerous prominent American politicians, powerful \nbusiness executives, foreign presidents, a well-known prime minister, and otherworld leaders.\" \nThe filing names Prince Andrew, the Duke of York, as one of those world leaders. \nThe Florida Center for Investigative Reporting is a nonprofit news organization supported by foundations and individual contributions.

These constraints do imply that, for instance, the brain is neither a\nrelational database (in which information is stored in a wholly localized manner) nor a collection\nof “grandmother neurons” that respond individually to high-level percepts or concepts; nor a\nsimple Hopfield type neural net (in which all memories are attractors globally distributed across\nthe whole network). But they don’t tell us nearly enough to, for instance, create a formal neural\nnet model that can confidently be said to represent knowledge in the manner of the human brain.\n\nAs a first example of the current state of knowledge, we’ll discuss here a series of papers\nregarding the neural representation of visual stimuli [QaGKKF05, QKIKF 08], which deal with\nthe fascinating discovery of a subset of neurons in the medial temporal lobe (MTL) that are\nselectively activated by strikingly different pictures of given individuals, landmarks or objects,\nand in some cases even by letter strings. For instance, in their 2005 paper titled \"Tnvariant visual\nrepresentation by single neurons in the human brain”, it is noted that\n\nin one case, a unit responded only to three completely different images of the ex-president Bill Clinton.\nAnother unit (from a different patient) responded only to images of The Beatles, another one to cartoons\nfrom The Simpson’s television series and another one to pictures of the basketball player Michael Jordan.\n\nTheir 2008 follow-up paper backed away from the more extreme interpretation in the title as\nwell as the conclusion, with the title “Sparse but not ‘Grandmother-cell’ coding in the medial\ntemporal lobe.” As the authors emphasize there,\n\nGiven the very sparse and abstract representation of visual information by these neurons, they could in\nprinciple be considered as ‘grandmother cells’. However, we give several arguments that make such an\nextreme interpretation unlikely.\n\nTL neurons are situated at the juncture of transformation of percepts into constructs that can be\nconsciously recollected. These cells respond to percepts rather than to the detailed information falling\non the retina. Thus, their activity reflects the full transformation that visual information undergoes\nhrough the ventral pathway. A crucial aspect of this transformation is the complementary development\nof both selectivity and invariance. The evidence presented here, obtained from recordings of single neuron\nactivity in humans, suggests that a subset of MTL neurons possesses a striking invariant representation\nor consciously perceived objects, responding to abstract concepts rather than more basic metric details.\nThis representation is sparse, in the sense that responsive neurons fire only to very few stimuli (and are\nmostly silent except for their preferred stimuli), but it is far from a Grandmother-cell representation.\nThe fact that the MTL represents conscious abstract information in such a sparse and invariant way is\n\nconsistent with its prominent role in the consolidation of long-term semantic memories.\n\nIt’s interesting to note how inadequate the [QIK KF 08] data really is for exploring the notion\nof glocal memory in the brain. Suppose it’s the case that individual visual memories corre-\nspond to keys consisting of small neuronal subnetworks, and maps consisting of larger neuronal\nsubnetworks. Then it would be not at all surprising if neurons in the “key” network corre-\nsponding to a visual concept like “Bill Clinton’s face” would be found to respond differentially\nto the presentation of appropriate images. Yet, it would also be wrong to overinterpret such\ndata as implying that the key network somehow comprises the “representation” of Bill Clinton’s\nface in the individual’s brain. In fact this key network would comprise only one aspect of said\nrepresentation.\n\nIn the glocal memory hypothesis, a visual memory like “Bill Clinton’s face” would be hypoth-\nesized to correspond to an attractor spanning a significant subnetwork of the individual’s brain\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_013180\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

Separately, Avenatti and another attorney — an unnamed co-conspirator since identified as celebrity defense attorney Mark Geragos — also demanded Nike hire them to conduct an \"internal investigation\" related to amateur player recruiting.\n\nThe cost: at least $12 million and as much as $25 million. Prosecutors said Avenatti was also recorded at a March 21 meeting with Nike lawyers at Boies Schiller Flexner LLP offering to end the entire matter, with no bad publicity for Nike, for $22.5 million.\n\nIf the company didn't agree, Avenatti threatened an immediate press conference amid the NCAA basketball tournament about Nike making payments to youth players and their families, prosecutors said, an event he promised would snowball into more bad press and people coming forward with claims of recruiting malfeasance.\n\nIn a recorded phone call, Avenatti told Nike attorneys that if the company tried to negotiate a cap on the investigation fees, he would go public and \"take a billion dollars off your client's market cap,\" according to the complaint. At a March 21 meeting in New York, Avenatti allegedly continued to wield threats and press for the investigator role, at one point asking Nike attorneys if they'd ever had \"the balls of a client in [their] hands.\"\n\n\"Michael Avenatti may be the best lawyer in the world, according to Michael Avenatti, but there are appropriate courses of conduct to address an alleged wrongdoing, and I don't see how a demand of, 'Give me a job and pay me $12 million,' is ever going to make the client whole,\" Saland said.\n\nAdam Felsenstein, a white collar defense specialist at Gallet Dreyer & Berkey LLP, called the prosecutor's narrative \"very extortive,\" particularly on the allegation regarding Avenatti's demand to be hired directly by the company. If that element of the charges is well-founded, it would effectively leave Avenatti without a \"cloak of legitimacy\" that he was acting solely to resolve a dispute on behalf of his client.\n\nThe complaint \"doesn't even refer to anticipated litigation. It's just, 'I'm going to reveal embarrassing information unless you pay me.' And once you start asking for money for yourself like that, you trend into extortion,\" Felsenstein said.\n\nBarry Temkin of Mound Cotton Wollan & Greengrass LLP similarly characterized the alleged scheme as \"brazen,\" and voiced doubt Avenatti would be able to argue that he could pressure Nike to hire him as an investigator and stay within the legal lines.\n\n\"He's going to them with a demand that they hire him even as he's threatening them with this press conference, which is screwed up on a lot of levels,\" he said. \"It's ambulance chasing, which is unethical. It's a conflict of interest, and who would want to hire someone to do an internal investigation who is also shaking them down?\"\n\nAvenatti was arrested Monday just after he announced via Twitter an impending press conference about a \"major high school/college basketball scandal\" and criminal conduct \"at the highest levels of Nike.\"\n\nIn an unrelated action, federal officials in California charged Avenatti on Monday with defrauding a client out of a $1.6 million settlement and lying to a Mississippi bank to secure loans for his firm and a coffee business.\n\nAvenatti was released in New York later in the day after posting a $300,000 bond. He is due in court on the California case on Monday. He did not respond to multiple requests for comment Tuesday. A message seeking comment from Geragos was also not returned.\n\nAvenatti shot to national prominence last year representing Stormy Daniels, the porn actress who took $130,000 from Trump lawyer Michael Cohen to stay quiet about her affair with the future president and then sued to void the deal.\n\nThe brash lawyer seemed to relish needling Trump and others on countless cable news appearances and on Twitter. He also faced mounting legal troubles in the form of a $10 million judgment stemming from the breakup of his old firm, Eagan Avenatti LLP, and accusations from former partners that he hid millions in assets. Avenatti also split with Daniels in recent weeks.\n\nDaniels said Monday she was \"saddened but not shocked\" by news of Avenatti's arrest, and that he had dealt with her \"extremely dishonestly.\"\n\nDespite the recent setbacks, Avenatti was back on Twitter less than 24 hours after his arrest, saying Nike had made payments to the mother of Phoenix Suns player DeAndre Ayton while he was a college player and to University of Oregon center Bol Bol.\n\n\"A lot of people at Nike will have to account for their criminal conduct, starting with Carlton DeBose & moving higher up. The diversion charade they orchestrated against me will be exposed,\" he tweeted. DeBose is the head of Nike's youth basketball division.\n\nA Nike spokesperson on Tuesday referred to a company statement that it has been cooperating with a government investigation into NCAA basketball for more than a year, and would not \"be extorted or hide information\" relevant to that probe.\n\nThe case is U.S. v. Avenatti, case number 19-mj-2927, in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

This latter group reminds me of the ancient Greek\nGods: they are very powerful, but sometimes flawed, as their\ninterventions in the world did not always work as planned.\nWe are getting closer to the Twilight of the Gods, a time when\nthey are either running out of ammunition, or the ability to use\nit without causing even more problems. If so, the private\nsector will have to recover on its own.

Morgan Private Bank, as of July 2011.\nThese portfolios may not be suitable for all investors & are shown for\nillustrative purposes only\nPROFITS\nThe primary (and perhaps sole) justification for carrying the levels of risk shown above relates to corporate profits. As\nshown below, profit margins have reached levels not seen in decades. The challenge, which we have discussed many times\nbefore: what is driving these margins 2 ? One useful way to deconstruct profits is to measure them from peak to peak, and\nanalyze what changed. As shown in the first chart, S&P 500 profit margins increased by ~1.3% from 2000 to 2007. There are a\nlot of moving parts in the margin equation, but as shown in the second chart, reductions in wages and benefits explain the\nmajority of the net improvement in margins. This trend has continued; as we have shown several times over the last two\nyears, US labor compensation is now at a 50-year low relative to both company sales and US GDP (see EoTM April 26, 2011).\nS&P 500 pre-tax margins\nExcluding financials, large-cap proxy used before1976\n16%\n15%\n14%\n1.3% increase\n13%\n12%\n11%\n10%\n9%\n8%\n7%\n6%\n1965 1970 1975 1980 1985 1990 1995 2000 2005 2010\nSource: Corporate reports, Empirical Research Partners.

Why is US labor compensation so low? The lingering excess labor supply from the recession is one reason, but the 2\nbillion people in Asia joining the global labor force over the last two decades is another. As shown on next page, EM wages for\nproduction workers remain well below US levels 3 . Another factor helping profit margins: increased US imports of intermediate\ngoods from Asia. As shown in the accompanying chart, imports from Asia have been rising, and over the same time frame,\nAsian import prices only increased at around 1% per year.\n1 We use these portfolios to manage assets for clients who give us discretion over their funds, and to provide recommendations to those who\ndon’t. This is one of several model portfolios we manage globally. They differ by jurisdiction, risk tolerance, tax treatment, eligibility to\npurchase vehicles designated for qualified purchasers, and other factors.\n2 Empirical Research Partners does more work on corporate profits than anyone else we’ve seen. This section draws on research that Mike\nGoldstein at Empirical shared with us at a recent investment committee meeting.\n3 A recent study from Boston Consulting Group maintains that the gap between China and the US will close in 5 years. BCG believes that\nwith Chinese wages growing at 15%-20% per year, US wages growing at 3% per year, higher productivity in the US and rising shipping and\ninventory costs, the China advantage will disappear within the decade. Some of these assumptions seem aggressive to apply in perpetuity.\n1\nJuly 11, 2011\nTopics: Portfolios, US corporate profits and the Twilight of the Gods (in the US, Europe, China and the IEA)\nHourly compensation for production workers\nShare of US rate, 2005 vs. 2011\n30%\n25%\n2005\n2011E\nShare of US imports of intermediate goods from China,\nMalaysia, Thailand and Vietnam, percent\n14%\n12%\nTo summarize, we expect today’s margins to last a while longer, since relative costs won’t converge overnight. But we are not\ninclined to pay a high multiple for them, given their reliance on weak labor compensation, which in turn requires large\ngovernment transfers. The good news: markets are not applying high multiples right now, which is why we own the equities\nwe do. However, questions about the large but shrinking public sector toolkit knock 10%-15% off of our equity\nallocations, compared to where we would normally expect to be 2 years after a recession. We walk through 4 instances\nof this below, as it relates to US fiscal policy, oil prices, Chinese inflation and the European periphery.\nTwilight of the Gods, part 1: Limited room for fiscal policy to invigorate the US recovery\nHere’s what we know for sure about the US Federal debt ceiling debate:\n�\n�\n�\n20%\n15%\n10%\n5%\n0%\nTaiwan Mexico China Philippines\nSource: Bureau of Labor Statistics, Empirical Research Partners.\nThe government is facing the unappealing task of having to increase the Federal debt ceiling above 100% of GDP for the\nfirst time since the end of WWII, and only the second time since the debt ceiling was established in 1917\nThe government has already run out of money from traditional sources. As shown below, since May 16, 2011, the US\nTreasury has been raiding the cash, securities and borrowing capacity of government employee retirement and other funds.\nOf $270 billion of such balances which existed in May, around 75% has already been used up. There’s not much leeway\nleft, which is why the government will probably run out of money some time in August.\nThe debate about the existing Federal debt is the lesser of two problems. As shown on the following page, the present value\nof unfunded entitlement obligations (e.g., future debt) dwarfs the existing debt. That’s why there’s so much talk about a\ndeal to stabilize the long term trajectory of the budget deficit.\nThe rest is all speculation. The table on the next page shows the revenue and spending factors in play. It’s too early to know\nwhat kind of deal will be crafted. We believe that the deal with be composed of 80% spending cuts and 20% revenue/tax\nincreases (rather than 50-50), and will be closer to $2 trillion than $4 trillion. While it’s possible that another dose of fiscal\nstimulus will be built into the debt ceiling agreement, it might not be that large, and its impact could easily be offset by a\nsubdued consumer response due to expectations of higher taxes in the long run (e.g., Ricardian equivalence).\n10%\n8%\n6%\n4%\n2%\n0%\n2000 2007 2010\nSource: UN Comtrade, Empirical Research Partners.\nStatutory debt limit and debt subject to limit\nTrillions of gross debt, USD\n18\nGross debt/GDP\n16\n14\n12\n10\n68%\nDebt limit\n69%\nProposed increase\n99%\n86%\n78%\n73%\nDebt\n87%\n109%\n8\n2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011\nSource: US Department of the Treasury, J.P.

The timeline suggests that oil markets began focusing on the release of the\nSPR after the Libyan shutdown, the lack of a sufficient OPEC supply response, and weak economic data in the US.

As shown in the bottom\nchart we first published in March, there was not much slack\neven before the Libyan shutdown, and oil demand is expected\nto rise 1-2 mm bpd as the developed and emerging world\ncontinue to grow. One of our colleagues used to work at the\nIEA, and in a recent piece 4 , argued that the impact of the SPR\nrelease will be limited to Q3 2011, and that upside oil price\nrisks to 2012 have increased. Why?

Perhaps; Premier Wen has stated that the country’s efforts to control inflation have worked, that price stability is in an\nacceptable range, and that it will drop steadily from here. But last week’s headline inflation release of 6.4% hit a three year\nhigh, and it is not clear to us that China is about to end its various inflation control policy measures.\nIn favor of Wen’s argument, food inflation has been a large contributor, some of which should be transitory. Blue-ear pig virus\n(PRRS) killed hundreds of thousands of pigs in 2010, which affected this year’s supply (2006 was worse). As shown below,\npork prices have soared, but should come down if the supply situation normalizes. [Note: a “Strategic Pork Reserve” can be\nreleased to mitigate price increases]. However, according to the Food and Agriculture Organization 5 , new virulent strains of\nthe virus have a fatality rate of 20% (even higher for piglets), and what is considered a temporary supply shock may be more\npermanent. Chinese pig facilities have the highest animal densities in the world, contributing to the spread of disease to 25 of\nChina’s 33 provinces. Antibiotics have proven ineffective, and once one pig gets the disease, it tends to spread to the entire\nherd in 7-10 days. China has vaccinated 100 million of its 500 million pigs, but existing vaccines do not prevent infection, they\nonly slow the rate of transmission to other pigs.\n8\n2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011\nSource: China Ministry of Commerce.\nA separate issue is that China is doing a lot more to control the supply of money than the cost of money. As shown below, there\nhave been a lot more increases in bank reserve requirements than interest rate increases. Deposit rates are still negative in real\nterms, and bank reserve requirements only affect banks, and not the shadow banking system, which is growing in China.\nChina reserve requirement ratio for large banks\nPercent\n23%\n21%\n19%\n17%\n15%\n13%\n11%\n9%\n7%\n5%\n2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011\nSource: People's Bank of China.\nChinese wholesale pork price\nRMB per kilogram\n26\nForward-looking manufacturing surveys have declined and interbank lending rates (Shibor) have surged, so it’s clear that the\ntightening steps are working. But private sector credit is still growing in China, and real estate prices are still rising. The\nbottom line is that the substantial stimulus provided by Chinese and other Asian policymakers in the wake of the\nrecession has not yet been adequately withdrawn, and that more steps will need to be taken to do so.\n24\n22\n20\n18\n16\n14\n12\n10\nBegining of\nPRRS outbreak\nChina one-year deposit rate still negative in real terms\nPercent, year on year\n10%\n8%\n6%\n4%\n2%\n0%\nDeposit rate\n-2%\n2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011\nSource: People's Bank of China, National Bureau of Statistics.\nCPI\n5 “Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) virulence jumps and persistent circulation in Southeast Asia”, Food and\nAgriculture Organization Emergency Prevention System, Issue number 5, 2011.\n4\nJuly 11, 2011\nTopics: Portfolios, US corporate profits and the Twilight of the Gods (in the US, Europe, China and the IEA)\nTwilight of the Gods, part 4:\nIs Europe just trying to save its banking system, or is a more comprehensive move towards Federalism underway?\nI expected French proposals on a Greek debt exchange to begin to spell out the sacrifices private sector investors will have to\nmake as Greece spirals towards insolvency. As shown below, I was wrong about that. French proposals don’t entail any\nspecific commitments by banks, and are merely non-binding indications of interest by banks to roll over debt at some point in\nthe future as it matures. If bank rollovers of Greek debt or Greek government asset sales fall short of the mark, the EU and IMF\nappear committed to providing Greece with funds to pay off maturing debt anyway. The EU taxpayer continues to foot the bill.\nBinding commitments from EU banks to roll over\nGreek debt as per French posposal, Euros in billions\nThis chart intentionally left blank since there are\nno binding committments at all\nItaly gross debt to GDP\nPercent\n120%\n110%\n100%\n90%\n80%\nLittle progress on debt\nreduction despite 20 years of\nprimary budget surpluses\n70%\n60%\nMaastricht limit\nSo to be clear, the Twilight of the Gods has not arrived in Europe, since the EU appears determined to spend more money\nto prevent a sovereign default. I see why they are worried about contagion. The latest signs: Portugal downgraded to junk;\nlong-term debt of 3 French banks put on downgrade watch; and stress in European unsecured interbank markets 6 , now affecting\nItalian banks which rely heavily on them. Italian bank and insurance company holdings of their own government bonds is 2x-\n3x higher than the rest of the region, creating the potential for a vicious circle if something goes wrong. Italian banks are bettercapitalized\nand have higher quality assets than banks in other European countries, since Italy did not experience a large boombust\nin residential property, or a consumer debt binge. However, like Greece and Ireland, Italy’s debt/GDP ratio is above 100%,\nand the country suffers from low growth (the lowest in the world from 2000-2010 other than Zimbabwe and Haiti, according to\nthe Economist). Think about this: Italy has run a primary budget surplus (i.e. ex-interest payments) every year since 1992,\nbut still hasn’t been able to bring its debt ratios below 100% of GDP. Italy was making progress, but the recession derailed\nthem, leaving Italy with the same elevated debt burden they started with 20 years ago.\nI believe that eventually, the constituency of the European Monetary Union will have to change. However, my colleagues in\nJ.P. Morgan Securities’ economics group disagree. They believe that the EMU will survive intact, and believe that Europe is\nmoving towards Federalism, with this crisis as the basis for putting it in place. I have been a skeptic of this idea; how can a\nregion use the structural failures of its current model as an excuse for expanding it, particularly when popular support for\nthe European project is at such low levels 7 ? The history of Europe does show that revolutions are often imposed from above\n(e.g., Peter the Great, Otto von Bismarck, Napoleon) rather than below, so anything is possible. If my colleagues are right,\nlosses suffered by holders of Greek, Irish and Portuguese debt may be a lot less than what’s priced in right now. I don’t have\nthe conviction to make that kind of call, at least not yet; geopolitical investing is a very hard thing to do. We remain cautious\non Europe; are underinvested in government debt, corporate credit and equities across the region; and expect a Greek\nsovereign debt restructuring within the next 18 months (see chart from “Five Stages of Greece”, June 30, 2011 ).\nMichael Cembalest\nChief Investment Officer\n50%\n1992 1994 1996 1998 2000 2002 2004 2006 2008 2010\nSource: International Monetary Fund.\n6 JP Morgan’s Prime Money Market Fund is indicative of industry concerns about a liquidity squeeze. The fund holds no Greece, Portugal,\nIreland or Spain. Its Italy holdings are less than 2% of the fund, and the portfolio manager does not expect to roll them when they mature.\n7 A 2010 Eurobarometer Poll showed very low readings on whether “Membership in the EU is a good thing”. More recently, the centre-left\nFoundation for European Progressive Studies polled EU civil servants (a pro-EU constituency if there ever was one) and found that a\nmajority believe that “the European model has entered into a lasting crisis”. Only a quarter of respondents saw the EU as having evolved\npositively over the last decade, or believe that the December 2009 Lisbon Treaty has had a positive effect.\n5\nJuly 11, 2011\nTopics: Portfolios, US corporate profits and the Twilight of the Gods (in the US, Europe, China and the IEA)\nThe material contained herein is intended as a general market commentary.

But it doesn’t have to be that way, says\nStephen K. Bannon, the chief ideologist of the populist wave that brought Donald Trump into the White House. “If the\nRepublicans continue on the path they are on,” Bannon told me Thursday, “they will lose 40 seats in the House and\nPresident Trump will be impeached.” He presented an alternative that strikes me as clever, and it’s a strategy that\nTrump himself seems to instinctively get.\n\nBannon was in Rome to learn from and provide support to the unusual coalition of populists and nationalists who\ntogether won half the vote in Italy’s recent elections and are now set to govern. Bannon sees that sort of coalition —\nmixing left and right, old and young — as his goal for the United States. “Europe is about a year ahead of the United\nStates. ... You see populist-nationalist movements with reform [here]. ... You could begin to see the elements of\nBernie Sanders coupled with the Trump movement that really becomes a dominant political force in American politics.”\n(This column draws on an on-air interview he did with me for CNN, as well as a subsequent conversation.)\n\nThe Republican Party’s strategy, for now, appears to be to make the midterm elections a series of local contests focusing\non the tax cut and the healthy economy. Bannon views this as fundamentally misguided. “You have to nationalize the\nelection,” he said. Bannon understands that voters are moved from the gut more than through a wonky analysis of\ntaxes. “This is going to be an emotional [election] — you’re either with [House Minority leader] Nancy Pelosi or you’re\nwith Donald Trump. ... Trump’s second presidential race will be on Nov. 6 of this year.”\n\nBannon is most focused on the issue of immigration because it hits both the heart and the head. “Immigration is about\nnot just sovereignty, it’s about jobs.” He believes that the Trump coalition can attract up to a third of Sanders supporters\nwho see trade and immigration as having created unfair competition for jobs, particularly for working-class blacks and\nHispanics. He advocates appealing directly to those voters, saying, “You’re not going to be able to take the Hispanic and\nblack community from the STEM system in grammar school to our best engineering schools . . . to the great jobs in\nSilicon Valley, unless you start to limit these H-1B visas and this unfair competition . . . from East Asia and South Asia.”\n\nNow this strikes me as entirely wrong. The reason that not enough Hispanic and black students end up in Silicon Valley\nhas much more to do with a broken education system, particularly for poorer kids, than the modest number of skilled\nAsian immigrants who get work visas. The most likely result of limiting these visas is that talented immigrants will simply\ngo elsewhere — Canada, Britain, Australia — and start successful companies there. And, in fact, there is lots of evidence\nthis is already happening.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_031112\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

I get so wrapped up with my nose in a book and trip\nover my own two feet if I’m not careful enough.” We were both giggling\nnow and I further introduced myself to her. Her name was Valerie or\nVickie or something like that, anyways she was a student at a school for\nhairdressing nearby. Chatting away both young and similar interests in\neach other’s choice of reading we found it easy to speak with one another.\nShe wasn’t from around here only being in the city for the last two\nmonths, her parents hated her being here, but were also supportive in her\nbig decision to move from the countryside in hopes of her accomplishing\nher own dreams. Aside from not having her near them, they just wanted\nher to be happy and supported in her big decision to move to the city,\nhelping her pay some of the way.\n\nShe was a pretty girl with cherry red hair and soft white skin. Her long\nlegs were emphasized by the short flowery dress that complimented her\nhourglass figure. She would definitely fit the pro quo for going down in\none of Jeffrey’s little black books. Only imagining the look on his face\nupon meeting her I could already see his sly grin spread from ear to ear.\nKnowing exactly what he would do with her and the very thought of him\ntarnishing a sweet country girl such as her just couldn’t be done.

This was my\nfavorite time of the year. Making the most use of his island we spent\ncountless days of the increasingly hot days there.

Moreover, this is not merely a demand to produce existing documents. It is\nactually an interrogatory demanding that General Flynn create a new document containing\ninformation that the Committee seeks to discover. This is a demand for direct testimony, not\nmerely a testimonial act of production. As in Hubbell, General Flynn’s compilation of such a list\nwould be akin to him “answering a series of interrogatories asking [him] to disclose the\nexistence and location of [meetings] fitting certain broad descriptions.” Hubbell, 530 U.S. at 41.\nThe Court in Hubbell held that the witness could not be compelled to prepare such a list without\nviolating his Fifth Amendment privilege. Finally, the nebulous term “representative of Russian\nbusiness interests” necessarily would require General Flynn, in responding to the request, to\ntestify as to who is or is not a “representative of Russian business interests.” This too constitutes\ndirect testimony that is clearly covered by the Fifth Amendment privilege.\n\nThe subpoena’s second and third demands are even broader in scope than the first, given\ntheir request for all communication records with any Russian official. The complete lack of\nspecificity in the request makes clear that, unlike in Fisher, the existence of any document\nresponsive to the Committee’s request is far from a “foregone conclusion.” Fisher, 425 U.S. at\n411. The fact that the subpoena also demands all documents in the custody, control or\npossession of General Flynn’s “agents, employees, or representatives” underscores that the\nCommittee does not know whether responsive documents exist, who may possess them, or\nwhere they are located. Were General Flynn to provide responsive documents, he would be\nproviding compelled testimony about “the documents’ existence, custody, and authenticity.”\nHubbell, 530 U.S. at 28. This is precisely the sort of testimonial information that the Fifth\nAmendment privilege is designed to protect from compelled disclosure. See In re Grand Jury\nSubpoena, Dated Apr. 18, 2003, 383 F.3d 905, 911 (9th Cir. 2004) (finding an act of production\nto be testimonial in nature where a “subpoena seeks all documents within a category but fails to\ndescribe those documents with any specificity . . . .”).\n\nThe Committee must demonstrate more than general knowledge that a meeting may\nhave occurred; the Committee must demonstrate “knowledge of the existence and possession of\nthe actual documents” in order to prove that the existence and location of the documents is a\n“foregone conclusion.” Id. at 910 (emphasis added).

Well,\nlet's get more on that story now.\nWe're joined from Beijing by\nRobert Lawrence Kuhn who\nadvises China's leaders and\nmultinational corporations. He's\nalso the author of \"How China's\nLeaders Think\". How do they\nthink about this? It's difficult to\nknow where this might end.\nRLK: Let's look at what just\nhappened. China retaliated with\n$60 billion worth of U.S. goods\nthat it was putting tariffs on, but\nhalf of it was five percent, half\nwas 10 percent, which is less\nthan the American side, which\nwas 10 percent on all. And the\n$60 billion is proportional in the\nsense that it is about 40 percent\nof the total US exports to China.\nJust as the $200 billion was\nabout 40 percent of the little bit\nmore than $500 billion that\nChina exports to the US. So\nthat's the proportionality.\nRLK: There's a lot of talk there\nmight have been more\ncountermeasures like selling\ntreasury bonds or disrupting\nAmerican companies. That hasn't\noccurred yet. China is sending\nsignals that it's ratcheting down\nthe escalation, not trying to\nescalate it. China has to\nrespond. The government of\nChina, the Communist Party of\nChina, the leading Party, the\nruling party here, has two big\nfacets that justifies its\nlegitimacy.\nRLK: One is the economic\ngrowth. This is the 40th\nanniversary of reform and\nopening up — China's economic\nmiracle. Increasing GDP per\ncapita is almost 50 times,\nmaking the standards of living of\nthe vast majority of people quite\ndecent. Second area is national\nrejuvenation, national pride. And\nso the trade war affects both.\nYou have economics, and the\npride: the economics, the tariffs,\nare certainly suboptimal in all\nrespects for all countries, but\nChina must respond because it\nhas to maintain the dignity of\nthe country, but it does so in a\nway to signal that it wants this\nto resolve.\nRLK: It won't resolve soon. No\none expects it before the midterm\nelections. But it's very\nimportant to understand from\nthe US point of view what the\nreal issues are and where we\nseek the solution.\nHOST: What are the real issues?\nRLK: There are five real issues\nand I do not include the trade\ndeficit — because, obviously the\ntrade deficit is complicated. You\nhave components coming from\nother countries that is counted\nas part of the trade deficit, but\nChina gets no benefit from them.\nAn iPhone for example. Maybe,\nChina gets 6 or 10 percent of the\ncost of roughly $350 for a $1000\nretail price. China has also\nservice purchases that's not\nincluded in the trade deficit,\nsomething like $40 billion per\nyear — tourists, students.\nRLK: But there are five big\nissues that are really critical.\nOpening up of China's markets\nwhich have been closed. They're\nmaking some progress, not\nenough. Intellectual property:\nthis is an area that China really\nhas made substantial progress.\nAgain, not enough, need to do\nmore, but they've made\nsubstantial progress. This is\naffecting Chinese companies and\nChina knows it needs to improve\nIP protection.\nRLK: Third is industrial\nespionage, a very sensitive area.\nCyber theft: China has decreased\nit. It's a complicated area. It\nneeds to do more. Hard to know\nwhat the government does and\ndoesn't do, but everybody knows\nthat's looked at.\nRLK: Fourth is technology\ntransfer. And then government\nsupport of new technologies.\nThe last is the most sensitive\none.\nHOST: Robert Lawrence Kuhn,\nwe’re going to have to leave it\nthere. Lots to talk about. We do\nappreciate your time.\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

Productive plant\nis customized to original owners. Tract housing is not, but becomes adapted to them.\nOriginal plant operators and homeowners typically expect to stay put. Most do.\nWhen they do, their own valuations are higher than would likely be realized in sale.\nOwners’ valuations matter. Economics is more than prediction of sales prices. It is\nprediction of behavior. It is the owner’s valuation of an asset, not a hypothetical\n\noutside valuation, that predicts what he will do to exploit and defend it.\n\nMy depreciation theory does not jolt settled belief as forcibly as free growth theory\nor the pay rule and Y rule do.

The reason is typically not\ndiminished skills and performance just yet, as age-wage profiles show no little or no\ndrop in pay toward the end. I think itis more that we and our bosses see the drop\n\ncoming.\n\nLiteral pay is typically zero in retirement. Instead we earn imputed pay for taking\ncare of ourselves and one another, and for driving the grandkids to the zoo. These\nservices are tangible, not psychic, in that they save the hire of others to do the same.\nThe imputed pay is what the others would have charged. But it typically is not\nenough to meet our consumption needs. Retirees must typically draw down savings\nor depend on “social transfer payments”, meaning support from government or\n\nfamily or foundations, to make ends meet.\n\nChapter 2: Fast Forward 1/06/16 22\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_010962\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

Some doctors argued its use should be restricted mainly to patients with\nFH. But Mark Schoenebaum, Evercore ISI’s pharmaceutical analyst, says that investors were initially\ndisappointed because they had hoped the FDA would greenlight the drug for an even broader group.\nRegeneron shares were down 2.5% in afternoon trading before they were halted pending news.\n\nBut doctors may prescribe the drug more widely than the label suggests. A survey of physicians published this\nmorning by Geoffrey Porges, an biotechnology analyst at investment bank Sanford C. Bernstein, found that\nthey would use the drug in 30% to 40% of patients who had already had heart attacks. He wrote that 2020\nsales of Praluent could be as high as $4.8 billion.\n\nIn the survey, doctors expressed a preference for Praluent. One advantage of Regeneron’s drug is that doctors\nwill be able to start it at a lower, 75 milligram dose.\n\nSchleifer, who is a medical doctor and, incidentally, a billionaire thanks to his Regeneron stake, says that the\ncompany expects that as many as 8 million people who don’t have their cholesterol well-controlled could be\ncandidates for Praluent. He emphasized, though, that until larger studies prove the drug prevents heart attacks\nand strokes patients should always choose statins first. It will have sales representatives a\n\nInsurance companies and pharmacy benefit managers, who help insurers and employers manage drug costs, are\ngoing to do their best to restrict use of Praluent, though. Brennan, the CVS Caremark executive, says that he\nexpects patients will need to have medical records documenting that they have already taken statins. Those not\ntaking statins would need a blood test confirming that a statin caused elevations in muscle or liver enzymes,\nnot just complaints that they were achy. “We’re not trying to replace statins,” says Schliefer, the Regeneron\nCEO.\n\nMost people who have muscle problems from statins do not have those elevated muscle enzymes, says Nissen,\nthe Cleveland Clinic cardiologist, who is conducting a clinical trial Amgen and Pfizer, which is also\ndeveloping a similar cholesterol drug. He says he has patients who are “desperate” to take a statin but who\ncannot tolerate it because of muscle pain but do not have elevated muscle enzymes.\n\n\"Dehspite significant progress over the last decades, high cholesterol remains a leading concern in the U.S. and\nglobally,\" said Olivier Brandicourt, M.D., Chief Executive Officer, Sanofi. \"Praluent demonstrates the power\nof the Sanofi and Regeneron alliance to deliver a first-in-class therapy in the U.S. for patients in need.

A week ago, the 55-year-old investment banker began serving 18 months in jail.\n\nBut that plea deal - guilty of felony solicitation of prostitution and procuring a person under the age of 18 for\nprostitution - does not account for all five of the girls, one as young as 14, who alleged that Epstein sexually\nabused them. And why is Epstein serving his term in the overcrowded Palm Beach County Jail and not a state\nprison, where inmates are sent if their sentences are longer than one year?\n\nThe slow, dissatisfying resolution of the case sends a message to the public that there's a different system of\njustice for the wealthy who hire high-powered lawyers. Epstein's legal team included West Palm Beach defense\nattorney Jack Goldberger, Harvard Law School Professor Alan Dershowitz, who defended O.J. Simpson\nagainst murder charges, and Kenneth Starr, the prosecutor who pursued then-President Bill Clinton for lying\nabout sex with young women.\n\nPalm Beach police spent 11 months investigating Epstein before State Attorney Barry Krischer sent the case to\na grand jury, instead of charging Epstein so the man who once boasted of accepting only billionaire clients\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_021761\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

According to researchers\nat the James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies, open\nsources indicate that there are at least four, and potentially five,\nchemical weapons production facilities in Syria. One or two are\nlocated near Damascus, the other three situated in Hama, Latakia, and\nal-Safira village, near the city of Aleppo. Hama is one of the hotbeds\nof the Syrian revolt, which Assad's tanks attacked in early August and\nwhere, more recently, fighting has severely damaged the city's\nhospitals. Latakia is another center of unrest; it was shelled by the\nSyrian Navy in mid-August. Aleppo, Syria's second-largest city has\nalso seen significant demonstrations.\n\nIf anti-Assad insurgents take up arms, the chemical sites, as symbols\nof regime's authority, could become strategic targets. And, if mass\ndefections occur from the Syrian army, there may be no one left to\ndefend the sites against seizure. This could lead to disastrous\noutcomes -- including confiscation of the chemical weapons by a\nradical new national government, or sale of the weapons as war booty\nto organized non-state actors or criminal groups.\n\nIn such chaos, no one can predict who might control the weapons or\nwhere they might be taken. With these chemical weapons in the\nhands of those engaged in a possible civil war, the risks that they\nwould be used would increase substantially. The problem would be\nworsened further if some possessors were not fully aware of the\nextent of the weapons' deadly effects.\n\nAnd let's imagine that Assad is eventually removed: What leaders\nwould gain control of these weapons after he departed? Saudi-backed\nSunni groups? Iran-backed Shia organizations? Whoever they might\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_031933\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

The plight of their citizens who would most\nbenefit from the kind of attention a large and well-financed international human rights organization can\nprovide is being ignored as Human Rights Watch’s Middle East division prepares report after report on\nIsrael.\n\nHuman Rights Watch has lost critical perspective on a conflict in which Israel has been repeatedly\nattacked by Hamas and Hezbollah, organizations that go after Israeli citizens and use their own people as\nhuman shields. These groups are supported by the government of Iran, which has openly declared its\nintention not just to destroy Israel but to murder Jews everywhere. This incitement to genocide is a\nviolation of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide.”\n\nOnly by returning to its founding mission and the spirit of humility that animated it can Human Rights\nWatch resurrect itself as a moral force in the Middle East and throughout the world. If it fails to do that,\nits credibility will be seriously undermined and its important role in the world significantly diminished.\n\n= Amnesty International, which began as an organization dedicated to the freeing of political prisoners from\nrepressive regimes and won the Nobel Peace Prize for its noble efforts, has now turned into a hard-left political\nlobby that elevates its ideology above its commitment to neutral advocacy for the victims of repression. Consider\nits 2005 report on rapes and honor killings perpetrated against Palestinian women by Palestinian men in the West\nBank and Gaza. Such violence is a serious problem, especially in the Arab and Muslim world, because so few\nleaders within these groups are prepared to condemn it and so many even justify it as a necessary means of\nmaintaining family honor and male dominance. The AI report documented honor killings of women who had been\nraped. In one such case a 17 year old girl was murdered by her own mother after she was “repeatedly raped by two\nof her brothers.” In another case, a 21 year old “was forced to drink poison by her father” when she was found to\nbe pregnant.\n\nThe AI report places substantial blame for these and other killings on Israel! Here is AI’s conclusion, listing the\ncauses of the violence directed against Palestinian women, presumably in the order of their importance:\n“Palestinian women in the West Bank and Gaza Strip are victims of multiple violations as a result of the escalation\nof the conflict, Israel’s policies, and a system of norms, traditions and laws which treat women as unequal\nmembers of society.” The “escalation of the conflict” (which AI blames primarily on Israel) and “Israel’s policies”\nrank higher than the “norms, traditions and laws which treat women as unequal.” The report asserts that violence\nagainst women has “increased” dramatically during the Israeli occupation and has reached “an unprecedented\nlevel” as a result of the “increased militarization of the Israeli-Palestinian confrontation.” This is a deliberately\nfalse conclusion. In fact the number of such killings has gone down dramatically since the Israeli occupation. But\nif one were to believe the Amnesty International Report, it would be as if the West Bank and Gaza Strip had been\nviolence free for Palestinian women until the Israeli Occupation.\n\nFollowing the publications of the Amnesty International report, I spoke with Donatella Rovera, who is AI’s\nresearcher on Israel and the Occupied Territories and asked her to provide the data on which she had based her\nconclusion that violence against women had escalated to an “unprecedented level” during the occupation, and\nespecially during its most militarized phase. I also asked her whether AI had compared violence against women in\nthe occupied West Bank and Gaza with violence against women in unoccupied Arab-Muslim areas that have\ncomparable populations, such as Jordan. Rovera acknowledged that AI could provide no such comparative data\nand confirmed that the report was based on anecdotal information, primarily from Palestinian NGOs. “We talk to\nanyone who would talk to us,” she said. When I asked her for a list of the NGO’s that were the sources of the\ninformation, she refused to provide them because “there are things we can simply not provide to outsiders.” I\nassured her that I was not interested in names or identifying features, but only in statistical data regarding the\n\n335\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_017422\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

To illustrate this, let’s go back to the filming of the movie,\nDeep Throat, discussed in an earlier chapter.\n\nHarry Reems had sex on camera with Linda Lovelace. Anyone watching the film*' can see that\nshe is consenting, both verbally and by her unambiguous actions. But it now turns out, at least\naccording to a book she wrote, that her apparent consent wasn’t real, that she was compelled to\npretend she was consenting by her husband’s threats to kill her unless she went forward with her\nstarring role in the movie Deep Throat. Under the extreme view expressed by some radical\nfeminists and accepted by the Massachusetts Appellate Court, Reems could be guilty of rape even\nthough his mistake of fact about her consent was entirely reasonable.\n\nOr consider the following case I discuss in class. Among the group of American citizens in\nCalifornia who come from the Hmong tribes in the mountains of Cambodia, there is a traditional\nwedding ceremony for arranged marriages. The groom is supposed to go to the home of the\nbride, where the father of the bride greets him at the door. The groom pushes the father aside,\nfinds the bride, and carries her, screaming and yelling, from her parents’ abode. He is supposed to\nact like a young warrior, and she like a young virgin who wants to retain her status. It’s all\nplayacting, and part of the traditional wedding ceremony. In the case I teach, the young woman\ndidn’t actually want to go through with the marriage, and her resistance was not playacting; it was\nreal. But there is no reason that the groom would know this, so he took the bride home to his\nhouse, and over her “resistance”, which he believed was feigned, he consummated the arranged\nmarriage. She then ran away and reported the rape to the police, who arrested the young man. I\nasked my students how a case like this should be decided.\n\nThe class is generally divided, some argue that no always means no, even in the context ofa\ntraditional marriage ritual in which no is supposed to mean yes. Others argue that it would be\n\nunfair to impose our values on a minority that has its own culture and traditions.\n\nAnother case that raised similar issues arose in the context of a college friendship that turned ugly.\n\n5! T have never seen the entire film (see pages __ supra), but during the preview of a documentary about the film, I\nsaw excerpts from it.\n\n257\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_017344\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

He called and asked me to appear on a weekly television interview\nprogram called Moked. It was hosted by Nissim Mishal: brash, incisive, and one\nof Israel’s best-known broadcast journalists. I pointed out to the Rabin aide that\nI’d never done anything like this before. But he insisted it would go well. He\nbriefed me on the questions I could expect, not just about the Achille Lauro but\nthe wider issue of Palestinian attacks, as well as Syrian President Hafez al-\nAssad’s efforts to re-equip his air force after his losses in Lebanon. So I came to\nthe interview prepared. I brought audio tapes of the hijackers, and a large\nphotograph of the MiG-25s which the Syrians were seeking to acquire.\n\nMy appearance will not go down in the annals of great moments in\ntelevision. But at the time, very few Israelis even knew who I was, and I felt ’'d\ndone OK. I was surprised, however, when Rabin phoned the next day. “Ehud, I\ndidn’t see it. I was attending some event,” he said. But his wife, Leah, had\nrecorded the program. “I just watched it. I should tell you, I think it was\nexceptional. You did a great job. It was highly important for us, for the army,\nand, I dare say, for you.”\n\nI was not sure what he meant by saying it might be good for me as well,\nalthough a decade later, at the end of my army career, he would play the central\nrole into my entry into Israeli politics. It is true that there was also some politics\nat the upper reaches of the military as well, especially around the choice of chief\nof staff, and that Moshe Vechetzi’s term had only a year-and-a-half to go. But I\ndidn’t view myself as a serious candidate at this stage. Moshe’s own preference\nseemed to be either Amir Drori, the head of the northern command during the\nLebanon War, or Amnon Lipkin, the veteran paratroop commander who’d been\nwith me on the Rue Verdun raid in Beirut. My own hope was that the nod\nwould go to any even closer friend of mine: Dan Shomron.\n\nI had first got to know Dan well in the late sixties after Karameh, Israel’s\ncostly standoff with Arafat, when Fatah’s influence was in its infancy. We\nexchanged impressions on what had gone wrong, and why? When I became\ncommander of Sayeret Matkal, we remained in touch, and he took a close\ninterest in all of our operations. We also crossed paths in the Sinai in the 1973,\n\n218\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_028066\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

He even asked him to evaluate the\nsource’s bona fides for him. Gellman, for his part, raised the matter\nwith a former high official at the Justice Department.\n\nMoreover, as the intelligence world knew, Poitras was herself\na veritable lightning rod for attracting ex-NSA employees who\nobjected to some of its surveillance programs. In 2012, her previ-\nously mentioned filming in Berlin of NSA insiders could make her\ncommunications of interest to intelligence services that wanted to\nkeep tabs on possible NSA dissidents.\n\nNor was Snowden himself overly discreet. It will be recalled that\nhe had also advertised his Tor-sponsored CryptoParty activities over\nthe Internet and supplied Runa Sandvik, who worked with Appel-\nbaum, his true name and address in Hawaii. Sandvik had no reason\nnot to share the identity of her co-presenter with others in the Tor\nmovement. Snowden, of course, had his girlfriend make a video of\n\n© his presentation as well. He also bragged about operating the largest ®\nTor outlets in Hawaii. Even if his Tor software provided him with a\nmeasure of anonymity, it was not beyond the ability of the world-\nclass cyber services to crack it.\n\nUnder Putin, Russia had built one of the leading cyber-espionage\nservices in the world.

Victims never got that opportunity when Epstein faced criminal charges, because \nAlex Acosta___then the lead prosecutor, now the Secretary of Labor___let Epstein off with \na ridiculously lenient sentence. Despite having committed hideous sex offenses with dozens \nof minors, Epstein received a sentence of 13 months in jail, during which he was often free \nduring the day. \nEpstein's decision to buy his out of the civil lawsuit, one that he had the nerve to initiate, \nbenefits Acosta. The trial would have provided non-stop headlines, coupled with frequent \nreferences to the sweetheart deal Acosta gave him. As Randy Schultz puts it, the trial would \nhave been the occasion for a long overdue public shaming of Acosta. Now, he avoids this \nconsequence. \nBut this doesn't mean Acosta is out of the woods. He faces calls for his ouster from the \nTrump cabinet. \nSome calls are from the usual suspects. Michelle Goldberg of the New York Times has \nwritten a piece so obnoxious that it almost makes me want to see Acosta ride out the storm. \nBut some conservatives are also advocating Acosta's departure. Concerned Women for \nAmerica is a stalwart conservative organization. It describes itself, accurately, as \"focus[ed] \non seven core issues: the family, the sanctity of human life, religious liberty, education, \nsexual exploitation, national sovereignty, and support for Israel.\" (Emphasis added) \n> \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 030983 \nIts leader, Penny Nance, has called for Acosta's resignation. Noting that labor trafficking, \nwhich the Labor Department combats, is often conjoined with sex trafficking, Nance says \nthat President Trump would not have nominated Acosta if reports fully describing Acosta's \nconduct in the Epstein case had emerged earlier. \nSen. Ben Sasse has also weighed in. He sent a letter to the Justice Department asking it to \ninvestigate its treatment of Epstein, including the fact that the plea deal ensured that victims \nof the pervert would be denied the ability to comment on or object to the leniency of his \nsentence. Sasse is chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee Subcommittee on Oversight, \nAgency Action, Federal Rights and Federal Courts. \nSen. Marco Rubio, a longtime supporter of Acosta, says it would be \"very troubling\" if \npolitical influence led to a light sentence for Epstein. In Rubio's view, and that of every \nrational person, Epstein \"should have been in jail for a long time.\" Rubio added, however, \nthat he will reserve judgment until he hears Acosta's side. \nThat's fair. But so far, Acosta has provided no real defense for letting Epstein off so lightly. \nIn public, at least, he is standing by his argument that the deal was a reasonable one and that \nthis is old news. \nPreviously, Acosta had a different defense. He cited \"a year-long assault on the prosecution \nand the prosecutors\" by \"an army of legal superstars\" who represented Epstein. This \nallegedly included \"defense counsel investigat[ing] individual prosecutors and their families, \nlooking for personal peccadilloes that may provide a basis for disqualification.\" In this \naccount, the deal was made to relieve the pressure, while still getting a conviction. \nAcosta could hardly assert this explanation____i.e., that he wimped out___while seeking a \ncabinet position with the expectation of being appointed to more exalted jobs in the future. \nNor is the explanation particularly plausible. Acosta isn't the first prosecutor to face a \nscorched earth defense. Ask Ken Starr about this. \nI don't doubt that Acosta regarded escaping the wrath of the defense team as a benefit of \nreaching the plea deal. But I don't believe this was incentive enough to cause him, in effect, \nto throw the case. \nWhat was the true incentive? As I wrote when this story broke, I think it was the same \nincentive that explains much of his conduct in public life___Acosta's desire to accommodate \npeople he thinks can help him down the road. \nWhich people? Probably the lawyers at Kirkland and Ellis, where Acosta had once worked. \nEpstein enlisted Ken Starr* and Jay Lefkowitz, both of Kirkland, for his defense team. \nAcosta reportedly worked out the terms of his surrender with Lefkowitz, a former colleague, \nat a meeting in a location far away from the prosecutor's office. \nThe location of the meeting is itself suspicious. Prosecutors and other law enforcement \nofficials normally demand that those seeking a deal come to them. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 030984 \nThe fact that Acosta didn't is another sign___if one were needed___that this was a \ncapitulation. It also casts further doubt on the claim that Acosta was capitulating for the \npurpose of sparing the folks who worked with him in the prosecutor's office. \nThe key point, though, is that Ken Starr and Jay Lefkowitz were power players in \nWashington___men who might help Acosta down the road. \nReaders will be quite familiar with Starr's background. Lefkowitz was director of cabinet \naffairs and deputy executive secretary to the domestic policy council under President George \nH.W. Bush. Under President George W. Bush, Lefkowitz served as general counsel in the \nOffice of Management and Budget and later as deputy director of domestic policy at the \nWhite House. \nAccommodating such influential figures must have seemed like a good career move. Having \nStarr and Lefkowitz on his side might help Acosta get a judgeship, a cabinet appointment, or \na high-paying job back at Kirkland and Ellis. \nI'm speculating, of course. But my speculation finds support in Acosta's practice of \naccommodating the powerful. \nMuch of that accommodation is of Democrats. Indeed, at the time Acosta was working in \nMiami as a U.S. Attorney, he had alienated some Republicans by such accommodation  \nwhile at the Department of Justice. Some say he was on the verge of being fired when \nAttorney General Alberto Gonzalez parachuted him to Miami. The Epstein settlement was a \nway for Acosta to shore up his standing with some influential Republicans. \nWill Acosta be able to survive the current scandal? I don't have a clear sense about this yet. \nBut President Trump, who isn't bashful about sacking cabinet members, may come to \nbelieve (if he doesn't now) that it's disadvantageous to have a cabinet member who sold out \nteenage victims of sexual abuse, especially when the sell-out benefited an ultra-wealthy \nserial offender. \n* Some on the left are trying to make something or the fact that Starr, who had investigated \nBill Clinton in connection with sexual misconduct, later defended Epstein, a pervert. This is \nsilly. \nIn both instances, Starr was doing his job as a lawyer. Perverts are entitled to a defense and \nthere is nothing hypocritical about investigating Bill Clinton's misconduct when that was \nStarr's job and later joining the team that was defending Jeffrey Epstein. \nAcosta, by contrast, was on the team seeking justice for Epstein and for his victims. He gave \nup this quest for reasons that can't be defended. \nSent from my iPad \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 030985 \n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

I will spell out today's argument a bit better and cohesive\nwhen I get to it. Also, I should have recognized that the main point I tried to make would trigger Noam (who\nwas as always very generous, patient, kind and humble on the personal level, even though he did not feel like\nconceding anything on the conceptual one). Almost all of Noam's work focused on the idea that humans have\nvery specific circuits or modules (even when most people in his field began to have other ideas), and his\nfrustration is that it is so hard to find or explain them.\n\nI found Noam's hypothesis very compelling in the past. I still think that the idea that language is somehow a\ncultural or social invention of our species is wrong. But I think that there is a chance (we don't know that, but\nit seems to most promising hypothesis IMHO) that the difference between humans and apes is not a very\nintricate special circuit, but genetically simple developmental switches. The bootstrapping of cognition\nworks layer by layer during the first 20 years of our life. Each layer takes between a few months and a few\nyears to train in humans. While a layer is learned, there is not much going on in the higher layers yet, and\nafter the low level learning is finished, it does not change very much. This leads to the characteristic bursts in\nchild development, that have famously been described by Piaget.\n\nThe first few layers are simple perceptual stuff, the last ones learn social structure and self-in-society. The\nswitching works with something like a genetic clock, very slowly in humans, but much more quickly in other\napes, and very fast in small mammals. As a result, human children take nine months before their brains are\nmature enough to crawl, and more than a year before they can walk. Many African populations are quite a bit\nfaster. In the US, black children outperform white children in motor development, even in very poor and\nsocially disadvantaged households, but they lag behind (and never catch up) in cognitive development even\nafter controlling for family income.\n\nGorillas can crawl after 2 months, and build their own nests after 2.5 years. They leave their mothers at 3-4\nyears. Human children are pretty much useless during the first 10-12 years, but during each phase, their\nbrains have the opportunity to encounter many times as much training data as a gorilla brain. Humans are\nliterally smarter on every level, and because the abilities of the higher levels depend on those of the lower\nlevels, they can perform abstractions that mature gorillas will never learn, no matter how much we try to\ntrain them.\n\nThe second set of mechanisms is in the motivational system. Motivation tells the brain what to pay attention\n\nto, by giving reward and punishment. If a brain does not get much reward for solving puzzles, the individual\nwill find mathematics very boring and won't learn much of it. Ifa brain gets lots of rewards for discovering\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_026402\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

If any telltale traces had been left in chat rooms\nor social media, they would be systematically deleted. Even more\nimportant to the ultimate success of such a communications intel-\nligence coup, measures would be taken to conceal the extent of the\ndamage done by the “single point of failure” by not precipitously\nclosing down compromised sources. Snowden might believe that\nthe power of the information he held was so great that if disclosed\nby him, all the NSA’s sources would immediately go dark in Russia\nand China, but Russia might not wish to provide such clarity to its\nadversaries. An intelligence service need not close down channels\nit discovers are compromised by an adversary. Instead, it can elect\nto continue to use them and furnish through them bits of sensitive\nor misleading information to advance its own national interest. The\nreal danger here was not that the NSA’s “lights” would dramati-\ncally be extinguished but that all the future messages illuminated by\nthose lights would be less reliable sources of intelligence. The game\nof nations is, after all, merely a competition among adversaries to\n\n© gain advantages by the surreptitious exchange of both twisted and ©\nstraight information.\n\nTo review: When the NSA asserted in the summer of 2013 that\nover one million documents had been compromised, it was recog-\nnizing the most massive failure in its sixty-year history. Not only\nwere NSA secrets taken, but secret files from the CIA, the British\nGCHQ, and America’s cyber military commands had been compro-\nmised. It was, as Sir David Omand, the former head of the British\nGCHQ, described it, a “huge strategic setback” for the West. The\ngenie could not be put back into the bottle. There is not a reset but-\nton in this game. The best that the NSA could do now was damage\ncontrol while its adversaries took full advantage of the setback. Sev-\neral hundred U.S. and British intelligence officers worked around the\nclock in Washington, D.C., Fort Meade, Maryland, and Cheltenham,\nEngland, for months on end to determine which parts of the most\npowerful communications intelligence system in the world could be\nsalvaged from what had been the Snowden breach.\n\nAdding insult to injury, Snowden, speaking from his new perch\nin Moscow, told applauding audiences that the entire purpose of\n\n| | Epst_9780451494566_2p_all_r.indd 246 ® 9/30/16 8:13AM | |\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_019734\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

I will spell out today's argument a bit better and cohesive\nwhen I get to it. Also, I should have recognized that the main point I tried to make would trigger Noam\n(who was as always very generous, patient, kind and humble on the personal level, even though he did not\nfeel like conceding anything on the conceptual one). Almost all of Noam's work focused on the idea that\nhumans have very specific circuits or modules (even when most people in his field began to have other\nideas), and his frustration is that it is so hard to find or explain them.\n\nI found Noam's hypothesis very compelling in the past. I still think that the idea that language is somehow a\ncultural or social invention of our species is wrong. But I think that there is a chance (we don't know that,\nbut it seems to most promising hypothesis IMHO) that the difference between humans and apes is not a\nvery intricate special circuit, but genetically simple developmental switches. The bootstrapping of cognition\nworks layer by layer during the first 20 years of our life. Each layer takes between a few months and a few\nyears to train in humans. While a layer is learned, there is not much going on in the higher layers yet, and\nafter the low level learning is finished, it does not change very much. This leads to the characteristic bursts\nin child development, that have famously been described by Piaget.\n\nThe first few layers are simple perceptual stuff, the last ones learn social structure and self-in-society. The\nswitching works with something like a genetic clock, very slowly in humans, but much more quickly in\nother apes, and very fast in small mammals. As a result, human children take nine months before their\nbrains are mature enough to crawl, and more than a year before they can walk. Many African populations\nare quite a bit faster. In the US, black children outperform white children in motor development, even in\nvery poor and socially disadvantaged households, but they lag behind (and never catch up) in cognitive\ndevelopment even after controlling for family income.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_026416\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

I’m not suggesting that reusing\ntea bags is in any way analogous cheating on one’s taxes or committing other financial or sexual\ncrimes, but I am suggesting that people who have earned their money or fame by illegally cutting\ncorners will sometimes continue to do so, even though there is no longer a financial or other\nrational need to do so. Old habits die hard, but they can also kill or at least wound those who\ncan’t break the illegal ones. This is not in any way to justify such continuing misconduct. Indeed,\nquite the opposite, it is to condemn it—because celebrities have few excuses for their\nmisconduct—while at the same time trying to explain why it persists among some celebrities.\n\nI have thought a great deal about what motivates famous and powerful people to act so self-\ndestructively. The celebrities who I represented and advised have faced a wide array of problems,\nranging from criminal charges, to loss of careers, to public humiliation, to custody fights, to\ndefamations and to physical threats. Some of the most fascinating stories I can never tell because\nI learned them in confidence and helped resolve them without their ever becoming public. Most\nhave become matters of public record, and I am free to write about those and to offer my insights\nabout the famous people I have advised over the years and the problems they faced.\n\nThe question I am asked most frequently is: does being famous help a celebrity who gets in\ntrouble with the law? Or does it hurt? My answer is “yes.” Sometimes it helps. Sometimes it\nhurts. Always it matters. One of the most important jobs a lawyer who represents famous people\nhas is to figure out how to turn his or her celebrity into an advantage rather than a disadvantage,\nor at the very least to neutralize it (which is a near impossibility in our celebrity-driven world.) I\nrecall Claus Von Bulow once telling me that in England it’s all about “class and breeding,” while\nin America it’s all about “fame and celebrity.” Before he became famous for being accused of\ntrying to kill his wife, Von Bulow couldn’t get a good table at certain posh restaurants despite his\nwealth and social status, but when his name and face began to appear in every newspaper, he got\nthe best table in every restaurant.*?\n\n8 This conversation suggests an important distinction between different types of celebrities and their relationship\nto the legal process.\n\nThe first type consists of individuals who were already very famous before they got into trouble or before they\nneeded my legal advice. Among my clients who fit this category are OJ Simpson, who was among the most\nfamous football players in the country before he was accused of murdering his wife and her friend; Mike Tyson,\nwho was even more famous around the world, because boxing is an international sport; Mia Farrow, the actress\nwho had been married to Frank Sinatra and Andre Previn, and was involved in a bitter custody dispute with her\nlong time lover Woody Allen; Marlon Brando, Robert Downey, Jr.; Ben and Casey Affleck, Brook Shields; Martha\nSterwart; David Merrick, Frank Sinatra, David Crosby, John Lennon and several other actors, athletes and\nentertainers. Also included in this category would be President Bill Clinton, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin\nNetanyahu, Israeli President Katzav, Senator Mike Gravell of Alaska, and Senator Alan Cranston of California.\n\nA second category of celebrities that I have represented are those who were not well known to the public but whose\nalleged crimes made them famous. Claus Von Bulow is a prime example of this phenomenon, as he made clear in\nhis conversation with me.

Poor old Europeans have struggled with an almost unworkable\npatent system for nearly 30 years; a genuine Europe-wide patent only\ncame into effect in 2013.\n\nCreativity in the economy is now extremely important, and nothing\nemphasizes the point more than the job market.

But what?\nDavid Deutsch thinks creativity developed to allow one human to\nunderstand the thoughts of a fellow human being. We can't precisely\ncommunicate the ‘programs’ we run in our heads. We are unable to\ndownload a detailed thought and put it on a memory stick. He thinks\nour creative capacity developed to help us pass skills from one to another.\nThe ability to paint and sculpt is an accidental by-product of this adaption.\nIt's my view we evolved creativity to deal with new situations\nand puzzles in our daily lives. We use creative thought processes and\ningenuity to come up with novel solutions for when we can't rely on\nprogramming or a store of rules. Otherwise, the very first unforeseen\nsituation could kill us!\n\nComputer Creativity\n\nHumans find creativity difficult. It requires peace and quiet, detailed\nstudy and input of caffeine. How does a computer fare? I have argued\nthat computers cannot be creative above the logic limit, so this does not\npreclude them from creating within the narrow confines of a particular\nsolution space. But a human still needs to set the rules for this space.

At that point, I had no idea how, or even whether, I might get involved.\nBut since my appearance on Moked, others seemed to assume it might happen at\nsome stage. Out of nowhere, a leading political journalist, Hanan Kristal, had\nwritten a story in 1986 purporting to predict the successors to Israel’s political\nold guard: Peres and Rabin in Labor, Begin and Shamir in the Likud. It\nappeared in the newspaper Hadashot. The paper ran side-by-side photos of the\nostensible future leaders, doctored to look older, who Hanan predicted would go\nhead-to-head in the election of 1996, a decade away. One was Israel’s\nambassador to the UN and a protégé of Misha Arens: Bibi Netanyahu.

In the end, I agreed\nI’d think things over and that we’d talk in a week’s time. In the meantime, I\nwent to see two veteran generals who had found themselves in a similar\nsituation, mentioned as possible chiefs of staff but never chosen: Arik and Ezer\nWeizman. I saw Arik on his farm in the Negev. He was obviously enjoying his\nextraordinary political rehabilitation since the Lebanon war. His expanding girth\nwas settled into a sofa in the living room. I filled him in on my conversation\nwith Rabin. “I’m considering leaving,” I said. “It just seems like a long time to\nwait, even if I do get the job after Dan. There’s a lot else I want to do in life.”\nArik was probably the general most experienced in being denied the chief-of-\nstaff's office. On at least two occasions, he might reasonably have been\nconsidered. But in a career littered with tense encounters with his superiors, it\nnever happened. “You should stay on,” he said. You’re not that old. It'll\nprobably be good for you, and the army, to be deputy and then chief.” The only\nfurther advice he gave me was to do all I could formally to commit Yitzhak to\nmaking me Dan’s successor after his term ended.\n\nI visited Ezer at his home in the seaside town of Caesarea. We sat on the\nterrace, with Ezer’s gangly frame draped over one of the cane chairs. “Ehud, if\nyou stay, do you think you have a good chance of being the next ramatkal,” he\nasked. I said that while nothing could be certain, I thought there was a good\nchance. He replied without hesitation: “Then stay.” He’d come close to the top\njob, he told me.

Going back to my teen years, the question is why I\nchanged, within a few short months, from a C and D student in high school to an A+ student in\ncollege and law school. The change was dramatic and sudden—literally over the summer of\n1955, between high school and college. What happened in those two months to change me from\nbeing last, or close to last in a class of 50, to being first among the men (15 women were ahead of\nme)!” in a highly competitive class of 2,000, and then first in a class of 170 even more\ncompetitive men and women (only a handful) at Yale Law School? Was it me who changed, or\nwas it the schools?\n\nIt was both. I think I had begun to change during my last year in high school, but my reputation\namong the faculty was so firmly established and so negative, that teachers simply couldn’t see past\nit. Even when I got A grades on the statewide Regents exams, the teachers gave me Cs and Ds as\nsemester grades. My occasionally intelligent classroom comments were taken as ‘wise ass”\nremarks. And some of my teachers even thought I must have cheated whenever I got a good\ngrade on a test. So I doubt it was possible for me ever to shine in a high school where my\nfavorite teacher insisted that I was “a 75 student” and would always be “a 75 student.” (I didn’t\nquite live up to his expectations, graduating with an average below 75).\n\nMoreover, my high school was a Yeshiva—a “parochial school” and I am not a parochial person.\nI did not respect most of my teachers, and the feeling was obviously mutual. Creativity was\nfrowned upon. Rote memorization was rewarded. And “respect” for “authority” was not only\ndemanded, it was actually graded. I got a “U” for unsatisfactory. When I got to Brooklyn\nCollege, creativity was rewarded, rote memorization frowned upon, and respect was something to\nbe earned, not merely accorded by the title of Rabbi. The same kind of creative and challenging\nanswers that got me Cs and Ds in Yeshiva earned me A’s in college and law school.\n\nBut there was more at work than a change of schools. I changed over that summer as well. I\nwent to a new summer camp as an assistant counselor, where I excelled and received praise for\nmy creativity as a song writer for “color war” and for my leadership skills. I had always been a\nleader, even during my darkest days in high school, but the school rejected my leadership, fearful\nthat other students would follow me in my heretical ways. I always had an abundance of energy,\nbut it was—in the views of my high school teachers—misdirected.\n\nThat summer in Camp Maple Lake, I received confirmation of my talents, and the result was\nheightened self confidence.\n\nI also met a young woman and began my first serious romantic relationship, which culminated\nfour years later in my first marriage. Suddenly, I was “talented,” “attractive,” and “accepted.” It\nwas a great send off to college.\n\n'? Because of the draft, men and women were ranked separately.\n\n349\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_017436\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

Numerous headlines of stock market \"carnage\" have further eroded \ntheir confidence. As a result, some of our clients have asked whether this drop signifies the beginning \nof the end of a nearly 10-year bull market. \nWe do not think so. So far, this pullback is actually smaller than the two prior downdrafts we \nexperienced in late January and in mid-March, neither of which derailed the US economy nor the bull \nmarket. The steady factors we highlighted in our annual Outlook—such as economic growth, benign \ninflation, robust earnings, and low probability of recession—have not dissipated. Furthermore, while \nthe investor focus has shifted to the risks around the unsteady undertow, most of these factors are, \non balance, less concerning today than they were at the beginning of 2018. \nOf course, that is not the case across all geopolitical concerns. While trade tensions with Mexico and \nCanada have abated, those with China have certainly deteriorated and will continue to do so for the \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 026894 \nforeseeable future. But, in aggregate, there has been more improvement than deterioration, in our \nview. \nIn this Sunday Night Insight, we will provide a brief update on the steady factors and unsteady \nundertow. We then conclude with our view that the steady factors will likely continue to win this tug-of-\nwar between the two. \nSteady Factors \nWhile the headlines warn of equity market carnage, the facts do not support such alarming headlines. \nThe S&P 500 is still up 5.1% on a year-to-date total return basis and financial conditions remain at \neasier levels today than they did when the Federal Reserve began this tightening cycle in 2015, \ndespite the recent decline in equities and 0.76 percentage point increase in 10-year Treasury yields \nyear-to-date. Most importantly, as highlighted by Federal Reserve Chairman, Jerome Powell, we are \nin \"extraordinary times\" of steady growth and low inflation. \nEconomic Growth \nEconomic growth remains firm in the US. Both the Institute for Supply Management leading indexes \nfor manufacturing and non-manufacturing remain at very strong levels. Current activity indicators of \nreal GDP growth average about 3.5% for the third quarter and closer to 4% for the fourth quarter. \nForecasts for third quarter real GDP average 3.8% and fourth quarter forecasts are about \n2.8%. While growth is slowing from the 4.2% estimate of the second quarter, it is still forecast to be \nabove trend and we believe a modest slowdown is certainly preferable to continued growth at a pace \nthat was likely unsustainable and possibly even inflationary. \nIn aggregate, the economic data since the intraday peak of US equities on September 21st does not \npoint to any worrisome slowdown in GDP growth or the pace of employment. In fact, while the recent \n134K increase in non-farm payrolls was less than expectations, revisions to earlier months offset the \nmodest headline miss and the unemployment rate still fell to 3.7%. Furthermore, this 134k increase \nis above the estimated sustainable level of employment growth based on population growth and \nchanges in labor force participation, which our colleagues in Goldman Investment Research estimate \nis around 96k. Importantly, a modest slowdown in the 3-month average of non-farm payrolls, which \ncurrently stands at a very robust 190k jobs, is more likely to keep inflation in check. \nRobust Earnings and Buybacks \nContinued above-trend economic growth is supporting solid corporate fundamentals. While many are \nquick to dismiss this strength to US tax reform, it is only half the story. Earnings before interest and \ntaxes (EBIT) expanded by a very healthy 12% in the first half of this year and are expected to grow by \ndouble-digits again in the third quarter. This robust organic profit growth is also fueling sizable \ncorporate buybacks—a key source of equity market support. Our colleagues on the corporate \nbuyback desk expect the highest dollar amount for buybacks on record in 2018, with $1tn in \nauthorizations and $850bn in executed buybacks. \nEven so, such robust earnings growth has begun to foster concern that we have reached a peak in \nEPS growth. While we do expect the pace of growth to slow next year, a local peak in earnings \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 026895 \ngrowth has not signified an imminent peak in the S&P 500 historically. In fact, about 3/4ths of market \npeaks occurred more than two years after the peak in the growth rate of earnings. Moreover, stock \nmarket returns have remained healthy during this period, with high odds of a positive outcome over \nthe subsequent 6-24 months (see Exhibit 1). In short, the market ultimately follows the path of \nearnings and while their growth rate may be slowing, their absolute level is still rising. \nSource: Investment Strategy Group, Bloomberg. \nInflation and Interest Rates \nInflation data has remained at relatively low levels for all of 2018, as shown in Exhibits 2 and 3. In \nfact, some of the most recent data released in October have ticked slightly lower. Average hourly \nearnings dropped to 2.8% from the prior month's level of 2.9%. Headline CPI dropped to 2.3% from \n2.7% and Core CPI ex-food and energy remain at a low 2.2%, unchanged from the prior month. The \nFederal Reserve's preferred inflation indicator, Core PCE, also remains low at 2.0% which is in line \nwith the Federal Reserve's target, and unchanged from the prior month. \nWhile 10-year Treasury yields have risen by 0.76% (or 76 basis points) over the course of 2018, we \ndo not think the resulting 3.2% yield is enough to derail US economic growth. Keep in mind that most \nof the recent increase since late August was due to stronger real growth rather than runaway inflation \nexpectations. We expect interest rates to range between 3.0% and 3.5% in 2019 with a midpoint of \n3.25%, barring any major geopolitical conflicts such as one between US and China and or escalating \nconflicts in the Middle East. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 026896 \nNote: Average hourly earnings is available for the private sector starting in 2006 and is released \nin the monthly employment report. The BLS hourly earnings data for production and nonsupervisory \nemployees, -80% of the private sector, is available back to 1964. \nSource: Investment Strategy Group, Haver. \nSource: Investment Strategy Group, Haver. \nOf course, the recent backup in interest rates is providing equity investors with another source of \nangst. Yet our work suggests there are several reasons why rates could continue to rise before \nbecoming a material headwind for stocks. First, the 4% trend growth rate of nominal US GDP—\nreflecting 2% real growth and 2% inflation—remains comfortably above the 10-year Treasury yield of \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 026897 \n3.2% (i.e. the cost of borrowing). Stocks typically struggle when the cost of borrowing exceeds the \nnominal growth of the economy (see Exhibit 4). Second, the recent backup in interest rates was \ndriven primarily by improving real growth expectations, not higher inflation. This distinction is critical, \nbecause higher rates in response to improving real growth tend to benefit earnings sufficiently to \novercome the downward pressure they place on valuation multiples. Finally, it will take a number of \nyears before higher rates meaningfully impact aggregate S&P 500 interest expense, considering 91`)/0 \nof S&P 500 debt is fixed-rate and only 13% matures over the next two years. \nSource: Investment Strategy Group. Bloomberg. \nLow Probability of Recession \nWe continue to maintain a low, 10%, probability of recession driven by: \n• The positive trend of leading economic indicators \n• Low levels of inflation \n• The continued slow but steady pace of Federal Reserve interest rate hikes. We believe that \nFederal Reserve Chairman Powell's recent commentary indicates that the FOMC will continue to be \ndriven by data and financial market conditions. Their stated goal is to extend this expansion \n\"indefinitely.\" While the Federal Reserve dots point towards four more interest rate hikes by the end \nof 2019, we do not think that such hikes materially increase the odds of a recession in an economy \nthat continues to grow at levels that are generally regarded as above trend growth in the US. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 026898 \nRecent steepening of the yield curve. We have highlighted two measures of the yield curve as sign-\nposts we watch as an early harbinger of a recession. Both have steepened since their lows, as shown \nin Exhibits 5 and 6. \nSource: Investment Strategy Group, Bloomberg. \n*\"Near-Term Forward Spread\" is the implied 3-month forward yield 18-months from now. \nSource: Investment Strategy Group, Bloomberg. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 026899 \nUnsteady Undertow \nAs market observers attempt to explain the recent drop in US equities, the risks of geopolitical factors \nhave garnered considerable attention. Potential US retaliation over the recent disappearance of a \nSaudi journalist has only added fuel to the fire of worries given the risk that oil exports could be used \nas a political weapon in a world with tighter oil supply thanks to impending US sanctions on Iran. \nAs we review the geopolitical developments of 2018, it is clear that some of the risks have abated \nwhile others have increased. With the exception of a significant spike in oil prices due to the impact of \nsanctions on Iran or any escalation in US-Saudi tensions, we believe that the net impact of these \nshifts is not material enough to derail the US economic expansion or bull market. \nRisks that have abated  \nMexico: the election of the left-of-center populist president (Andres Manuel Lopes Obrador referred \nto as AMLO) has reduced fear of a reversal of recent reforms. While concerns about fiscal profligacy \nand reverting to a nationalist energy policy that reduces oil production may reappear, AMLO does not \ntake office until the end of the year. \nBrazil: The strong showing of Jair Bolsonaro, a law-and-order former army captain, in the first round \nof elections and the latest data that points to a 75% probability of Bolsonaro becoming the next \npresident of Brazil has provided a boost to the Brazilian real. His current standing has substantially \nreduced the election of another left-wing worker's party candidate who would keep the status quo in \nBrazil. \nNAFTA: The agreement on a revised NAFTA deal between the US, Canada, and Mexico on \nSeptember 30th meaningfully reduced the risk of the US withdrawal from NAFTA. While the new \nagreement, US-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), has not been ratified by the Mexican and \nCanadian national parliaments nor by the US congress, and a divided congress after the mid-term \nelections may lead to some uncertainty, we believe it is likely to be ratified. \nUS-EU Trade Friction: Tension between the US and European Union eased significantly after a July \n2018 deal between European Commission President Juncker and President Trump to \"work together \ntoward zero tariffs, zero non-tariff barriers and zero subsidies on non-auto industrial goods\". The \ncoast is not totally clear given the threat of auto tariffs, but we do not anticipate any significant \nincrease in trade rhetoric in the near future. \nRisks that have increased  \nChina: The trade war with China continues to escalate and as we have stated before, we believe that \nit cannot be resolved simply by China importing more US goods. The issues range from: \n• A large and growing trade deficit with China \n• Industrial policies & unfair trade practices that reduce competition, such as subsidies and \n\"dumping good at below-market prices\" \n• \"Made in China 2025\" policies which \"harm US companies\" \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 026900 \n• Uneven tariff rates and the banning of some US goods \n• Intellectual property theft \n• Forced technology transfer \n• Strategic US technology acquisitions \n• Outright cyber theft \n• Foreign ownership restrictions \nRecent headlines that the trade war may be escalating to a cold war are not without merit, as we \nbelieve that US-China relations are changing on a more structural basis and will have a longer-term \nimpact. On a short-term basis, however, US exposure to China is limited with merchandise exports, \ncorporate profits and foreign claims at about 1% of GDP. As seen in Exhibit 7, the Chinese equity \nmarkets have also deteriorated much more significantly than US markets in 2018. \nOf course, specific stocks with greater exposure to China through higher sales have underperformed \nthe S&P 500 by about 6% since the latest tariffs were imposed on $200bn of Chinese products, as \nshown in Exhibit 8. \nSource: Investment Strategy Group, Bloomberg. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 026901 \nNote: High China sales basket is aggregated and defined by Goldman Sachs Global Investment Research. \nSource: Investment Strategy Group, Bloomberg. \nItaly: Concerns about Italy have risen to peak levels since the election of a populist government in \nMay and credit default swaps have increased to reflect these higher risks. The government's \nexpansive fiscal plan, with a proposed budget deficit of 2.4% of GDP, may be rejected by the \nEuropean Union commission and result in rating downgrades. While the EU is likely to manage this \nsituation in its usual incremental and reactive way, the possibility of new elections in late 2019 \nreigniting euro viability questions will keep Italy on our radar screens. \nBREXIT: It is hard to know whether Brexit risks are unchanged, higher or lower given the minute by \nminute headlines out of the UK. Our base case remains that while the internal politics of the \nConservative party will keep uncertainty at elevated levels and the European Union will not \ncompromise on its key tenants of free movement of goods, services, and people, the two sides will \nagree to a deal that defers the difficult choices on the shape of a final agreement with the EU until late \n2020. \nThe Middle East: Risks in the Middle East have not changed substantially with respect to Iraq, Syria, \nor even the impositions of sanctions on Iran. However, the disappearance of the Saudi journalist who \nentered the Saudi Embassy in Turkey on October 2nd has the potential to raise risks to global oil \nsupply. While there has been a global uproar, it is not yet clear whether the US will impose serious \nsanctions or Saudi Arabia would retaliate by reducing oil exports if the US finds sufficient evidence \nregarding the alleged killing of the Saudi journalist. The recession in 1973-74 was partly due to the \nquadrupling of oil prices due to the Arab Oil Embargo. Later in that decade, the Iranian Revolution \nand the Iran-Iraq War also led to a 2.5 times spike in oil prices that, along with Federal Reserve \ntightening by then Chairman Paul Volcker, led to a US recession. While we think it is unlikely that \nSaudi Arabia would react so aggressively in the face of serious US reprisals, we note that it remains a \nreal risk. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 026902 \nSome Notable Observations \nUS Equities Have Been Shunned All Along  \nIn both our 2018 Outlook and mid-year update, we highlighted the surprising absence of inflows into \nUS equities based on flows into mutual funds and Exchange-Traded Funds. As shown in Exhibit 9, \nflows into US equities were negative in 2018, even before the recent downdraft. In fact, US equities \nhave seen outflows of $81 billion through August 2018 (based on the most recent comprehensive \ndata), while non-US developed equities and emerging market equities have had inflows of $72 billion \nand $20 billion respectively. This is further evidence of our view that while sentiment and short term \npositioning among speculators and hedge fund managers shifts frequently, more stable investors \nhave shunned US equities during this long bull market in favor of other developed and emerging \nmarket equities and global bonds. \nThis steady outflow of assets from US equities has been offset by record levels of stock buybacks by \nUS companies given high levels of profitability and incremental cash from repatriation of overseas \nearnings, as mentioned above. \nNote: Based on ICI weekly estimates through August 30,2018. Flows exclude reinvested dividends. \nSource: Investment Strategy Group, ICI. \nSome Headwinds Facing the FANG MAN Stocks Will Persist \nThe basket of FANGMAN (i.e. Facebook, Apple, Netflix, Google, Microsoft, Amazon and Nvidia) \nstocks have dropped across the board from their respective peak price levels, with Facebook's 29% \ndecline the largest and Apple's 4% decline the smallest among the group. Even so, each of the \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 026903 \nstocks, with the exception of Facebook, still have positive year-to-date returns and have outperformed \nthe S&P 500, as shown in Exhibit 10. \nThis is not a recommendation to buy or sell individual securities but rather an assertion that these \nstocks represent a small portion of S&P 500 earnings. Anyone looking to buy or sell single name \nequities should consult Goldman Sachs Global Investment Research. \nSource: Investment Strategy Group, Bloomberg. \nNevertheless, we believe that some of the headwinds that have plagued this sector will continue. \nThese include: \n• Data privacy issues impacting a broad range of companies, including Facebook, Google, Twitter, \nAlipay and Tencent. \n• High likelihood of greater regulatory scrutiny in the US2 and Europe as policy makers increasingly \nbelieve that these companies will not address \"the privacy and security issues of social media \nusers\"3 on their own. \n• Increased focus by ESG investors (Environment, Social, and Governance) that many of the \ntechnology and social media companies are falling short on social and governance issues. \nWhile this basket of stocks may or may not lead the market in the future, it is important to note that \nthey represent only 10% of S&P 500 earnings. \nInvestment Implications \nThe recent market downdraft has understandably rekindled fears that the longest bull market in \nhistory is coming to an end. While there are no certainties in investing, we do not think the odds \nsupport that conclusion based on our read of the steady and unsteady factors discussed above. Keep \nin mind that about 75% of historical US bear markets—defined here as equity market declines of 20% \nor more—have occurred during economic recessions. In fact, US equity returns have remained \nfavorable until about five to six months prior to the onset of recession, highlighting the penalty for \nprematurely exiting the market (see Exhibit 11). With only 10% odds of recession over the next year, \nwe think the economic backdrop remains favorable for stocks. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 026904 \nSource: Investment Strategy Group, Bloomberg. \nOf course, none of the supportive factors discussed above precludes further bouts of equity volatility. \nAs we highlighted at the beginning of the year, the historical probability of a 5% or greater correction \nfrom current valuation levels was 96%. Yet these statistics alone do not justify underweighting \nequities, since such pullbacks often occur after sizable equity rallies, as this year reminds us. \nMoreover, such pullbacks are quite normal historically. After all, stocks have suffered a median of two \npullbacks of at least 5% and one of at least 10% per calendar year in the post-WWII period, leaving \nboth the frequency and magnitude of this year's dips in line with past experience. Most importantly, \nyears that experienced a similar number of pullbacks as 2018 nonetheless ended with a median gain \nof 6% and had 77% odds of a positive return. \nConclusion \nAlthough we have painted a less alarmist view of recent market weakness, we are by no means \nPollyannaish. While bull markets do not die of old age, they do become more susceptible to ailments \nover time. Yet as we survey the tug of war between the steady factors and the unsteady undertow, \nwe do not think the balance of risks is strong enough to topple the ongoing US expansion and the \ncontinued growth of corporate earnings it supports. \nThat said, this viewpoint does not preclude further market volatility and the market may still make new \nlows if the current downdraft persists. But history suggests the bull market is likely to continue until \nabout 5-6 months prior to the end of this economic expansion. Thus, it will take a significant increase \nin the odds of an imminent recession to provide the trigger—that has been lacking thus far—to \ntactically underweight equities. In the interim, we continue to recommend that clients maintain their \nstrategic allocation to US equities. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 026905 \nSources: Investment Strategy Group, Bloomberg, Datastream, Goldman Sachs Global Investment Research, Haver. \nEndnotes: \n(1) Kate Davidson and Sarah Chaney, \"Fed Chair Powell Sees 'Remarkably Positive Set of Economic Circumstances,- The Wall \nStreet Journal, October 3, 2018. \n(2) Statement by the Acting Director of FTC's Bureau of Consumer Protection Regarding Reported Concerns about Facebook \nPrivacy Practices, March 26, 2018. \n(3) \nSenator Mark.

Even philosophy, in the Western tradition, leaves\nrevelation aside. A practical consideration is that debates of how God is likely to be\nmotivated to intercede have tended to find little consensus or traction. Science gets\n\nsome.\n\nI tipped my hand on my own views in Chapter 1. As chairman of the Leakey\nFoundation for more than 40 years, | pretty clearly buy evolution theory and\nunguided natural casualty as working assumptions.

I'll\n\nbring this up again as we go along.\n\nMy next few axioms, lumped together, are a mortal and reproducing population\nwhich competes, cooperates and freelances to act on convergent predictions. It acts\nto satisfy convergent tastes in a world of limited resources. I will model the\npopulation as human, although other species would do insofar as my axioms hold\nfor them. “Convergent” means non-identical from individual to individual or place to\nplace or moment to moment, but converging to norms with increasing scale in space\n\nand time. Predictions converge to outcomes as well as to one another.\n\nThe point is that tastes and predictions must be convergent enough for markets to\nform and hold. A market, as Becker knew, is where anyone makes any choice among\nalternatives. A literal market is where a choice leaves a quantitative record. Markets\ncannot form and hold if we cannot predict where to find them and what they supply\nand when they are open. They cannot form and hold without some consensus that\nwhat we predict they will offer includes something we want. Clothing stores can\nwork because our sizes and shapes fall mostly within standard ranges. Their\nbusiness would be in trouble if we did not agree in number and rough placement of\narms and legs and head. Restaurants can work because we can find what we want\non a finite menu. Most crucially, clothing stores and restaurants cannot hold unless\n\nthere is consensus on what their wares are worth in return.

Jeffrey invariably turns out to be a highly reliable source, with intimate knowledge and perceptive analysis, commonly going well beyond what I can find in the business press and professional journals.\n\nTurning to my own special interests in linguistics, cognitive science, and philosophy of language and mind, Jeffrey constantly raises searching questions and puts forth provocative ideas, which have repeatedly led me to rethink crucial issues. \n\nWe have also had (for me) very rewarding discussions on many other topics, for example the prospects for Artificial Intelligence, deep learning, multi-layered neural nets, automation and robotics, singularity, and related matters, exploring the claims and predictions and looking closely at the results that have been achieved, their intellectual contributions and social import.  We have also discussed many other issues, ranging from intellectual history, to world affairs and contemporary geopolitics, to foundations of mathematics, to such matters as recent discoveries about communication in the plant world.  He has also tried, so far with limited success, to carry forward my wife Valeria’s efforts to introduce me to the world of jazz and its wonders.  Whatever comes up, Jeffrey not only has a lively interest but also unconventional and challenging ideas and thoughtful suggestions.\n\nGiven the range and depth of his concerns, I suppose I should not have been surprised to discover that Jeffrey has repeatedly been able to arrange, sometimes on the spot, very productive meetings with leading figures in the sciences and mathematics, and global politics, people whose work and activities I had looked into though I had never expected to meet them.  Once, when we were discussing the Oslo agreements, Jeffrey picked up the phone and called the Norwegian diplomat who supervised them, leading to a lively interchange.  On another occasion, Jeffrey arranged a meeting with former Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak, whose record I had studied carefully and written about.  We have our disagreements, but had a very fruitful discussion about a number of controversial matters, including one that was of particular interest to me: the Taba negotiations of January 2001, in the framework or President Clinton’s “parameters,” events that remain obscure and controversial because the diplomatic record is still mostly secret.  Barak’s discussion of the background was illuminating, also surprising in some ways.  In very different areas, much the same was true in meetings Jeffrey arranged with evolutionary biologists, neuroscientists, mathematicians and computer scientists, several of them engaged in exciting work at the limits of understanding in their fields, sometimes with perspectives quite different from mine. More lively interchanges, in which Jeffrey was once again an active participant, often an effective gadfly.\n\nThe impact of Jeffrey’s limitless curiosity, extensive knowledge, penetrating insights, and thoughtful appraisals is only heightened by his easy informality, without a trace of pretentiousness.  He quickly became a highly valued friend and regular source of intellectual exchange and stimulation.\n\nNoam Chomsky\nInstitute Professor (emeritus), MIT; Laureate Professor, U. of Arizona\n\n\n\n\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

My first trip was in the early\n1960s as part of a student group that was trained at the Howard Law School to be “observers.”\nDuring that short visit I had little direct contact with local Black residents of the South. I did\nmeet several Black lawyers and civil rights workers, but they were generally from similar\nbackgrounds to my own. My second trip was by myself in the early summer of 1965, when the\nHarvard Law School sent me to several historically black colleges in an effort to recruit students\nfor a special program we had instituted to help prepare minority students for law school. I\ntraveled to several Southern states and lived on the campuses of predominantly Black colleges for\nseveral days. There too I met college students and professors, many of whom came from middle\nclass homes. I almost certainly met some students from deprived backgrounds, but they\nappeared, in the context of a campus setting, no different from students with middle class\nupbringings.\n\nI also spent time at several southwestern colleges with Native American and Hispanic students. I\nhad insisted that our recruitment efforts not be limited to African American students and that they\nshould include other minorities and disadvantaged groups that sent few if any students to elite law\nschools. Even back then, I felt uncomfortable having any decisions, even affirmative ones, based\non race alone. I believed then, and I believe now, that the ideal goal of affirmative action is to\nlevel the playing field by providing a current advantage to individuals who were subject to past\ndisadvantages, in order to assure future equal opportunities to compete on the merits with\nadvantaged individuals. That is the theoretical ideal — individual justice to assure that each person\nis judged by the quality of their character and other meritocratic criteria — but I soon learned that\nin practice group factors inevitably come into play. The real issue is how to strike the appropriate\nbalance between the theoretical ideal and the practical necessities.\n\nThis issue came to the fore in a series of controversial Supreme Court decisions, in which I played\ndifferent roles. The first was the case of DeFunis in 1974.*’ The second was the case of Bakke in\n1997,\n\nThe DeFunis case was brought by a white applicant to the law school of the University of\nWashington, a state school, who had been rejected.

This report is intended for amanda.ens@baml.com\nDeep dive on corporate tax reform\nOK, maybe it’s not as inevitable as death and taxes, but some form of corporate tax\nreform seems likely. It is a stated priority of President Trump and has widespread\nCongressional support. We here focus on four components that could have big equity\nimplications. We assess the impacts at a market, sector, and industry level, and plan to\nupdate and augment this work as more details come to light.\nPotential near-term boost to EPS, long-term impact varies\nOur 2018 S&P 500 EPS estimate of $137 already implies healthy two-year growth of +16%.\nTax reform in its entirety could add as much as $5-6 to near-term EPS, as benefits are frontloaded.\nThe sustained impact depends: under a 20% tax rate, the Blueprint would be\nmodestly accretive; under a 15% rate, this annual benefit could triple; but a 25% tax rate that\nwould appease the deficit hawks could shave $3.50 off of earnings each year. We also\nestimate a one-time $8-9 charge to GAAP EPS associated with the repatriation tax (Table 1).\nCutting corporate tax rate could add $8 to EPS\nOur starting point is the US statutory corporate tax rate. If it were lowered from 35% to\n20% and the US moved to a territorial tax system (no longer taxing foreign profits), it\nwould boost S&P 500 EPS by an estimated 12% ($17 to 2018 EPS). We assume\ncompanies would be able to retain half of the benefit ($8) and the remainder would be\npassed on to customers or competed away. For instance, a lasting impact to Utilities'\nprofits is unlikely, as the benefit would be passed on via regulated pricing.\nRepatriation: Buybacks could boost EPS by 3%\nBoth Trump and the Blueprint support a mandatory (as opposed to 2004's optional) tax\nof overseas earnings of US firms’ subsidiaries at reduced rates. Non-Financials in the S&P\nhold at least $1.2tn in overseas cash (mostly Tech and Health Care). If half was used for\nbuybacks, this could add 3% ($4) to S&P 500 EPS. A redux of 2004 where companies\nused 80% of cash for buybacks may be less likely, in our view. For if repatriation is\naccompanied by an end to interest expense deductions, companies may choose to pay\ndown debt over buybacks.\nBorder adjustment tax (BAT) hits EPS by $5-6\nWhile Trump has described the BAT as being “too complicated,” White House press\nsecretary Spicer’s recent comments call into question his stance. This is a key\ncomponent of the Blueprint and would generate significant revenue. First-order impacts\ncould be significant, with border adjustments detracting $5-6 from 2018 EPS — nearly\n80% of the drag comes from the consumer sectors. The second order impacts — product\npricing, pricing within the supply chain, exchange rates, foreign policy reactions, etc. —\nwhile harder to quantify, are important to consider.\nEnd to interest deductibility could detract 4% from EPS\nWe estimate that over time, the removal of the interest expense deduction would\ndetract about 4% from S&P 500 EPS. An increase in the cost of debt by an incremental\n25% could have longer term ramifications for capital structures and funding..\nTax reform winners and losers\nWe include stock screens for potential beneficiaries and victims of tax cuts, repatriation\nand interest deductibility changes, as well as industries most helped/hurt most by a BAT.\nNote that the very fact that there are companies and industries that have the potential\nto be very negatively impacted could call into question the likelihood of passage.\nBofA Merrill Lynch does and seeks to do business with issuers covered in its research reports.

Trump has continuously\nstated that tax reform is a priority, and there is evidence of widespread support in\nCongress. Tax reform could be enacted through reconciliation without the risk of being\nfilibustered, suggesting the timing could be imminent. Corporate tax reform could have\na significant impact on S&P 500 earnings, corporate behavior and capital markets. Much\nhas been written on the timing, funding and process by which corporate tax reform\ncould be enacted. In this report, we use House Speaker Paul Ryan’s Blueprint proposal as\na starting point in quantifying the impact of corporate tax reform on the S&P 500, with\nsome scenario analysis to account for differences included in the final bill (such as\nTrump’s proposals). Our analysis is focused specifically on the impact of corporate tax\nreform, however we recognize that there are many other factors that can impact the\nsensitivity analysis (e.g. changes to household income tax rates, infrastructure spending,\netc.).\nWe estimate that the Blueprint proposal would initially boost S&P 500 EPS by $5-6,\nassuming the end of interest expense deductions only applies to new debt, or is phased\nin over time. But the devil is in the details. Over time, the loss of the interest tax shield\nwould be a significant drag on earnings as existing debt is refinanced. Additionally, the\ncorporate tax rate is critical in determining whether or not the tax reform policies end\nup being accretive to earnings on a sustained basis. We estimate that at the 20% tax\nrate, the Blueprint would be modestly accretive, the benefit would triple under Trump’s\nproposed 15% tax rate, but at a higher 25% tax rate that would appease the deficit\nhawks in Congress, the benefit would turn to a negative over time (Table 2). We also\nestimate a one-time $8-9 charge to GAAP EPS that would be associated with the\ndiscounted repatriation tax.\nTable 2: Estimated impact of tax reform on S&P 500 2018 EPS\nTax policy 15% 20% 25%\nTax rate change 10.50 8.00 5.00\nEnding interest deductibility – initial impact* -0.50 to -1.00 -0.50 to -1.50 -0.50 to -2.00\nBorder adjustments -4.00 -5.50 -6.50\nShare count reduction from buybacks (50%) 4.00 4.00 4.00\nTotal initial impact 9.50 to 10.00 5.00 to 6.00 0.50 to 2.00\nEnding interest deductibility – recurring impact -3.50 -5.00 -6.00\nRecurring impact 7.00 1.50 -3.50\nOne-time repatriation tax (8.75%), GAAP\ncharge -8.50 -8.50 -8.50\nSource: BofAML US Equity & Quant Strategy, FactSet, Compustat, S&P\n*Assumes end to interest deductibility only applies to new debt, where we estimate 70-90% of debt is long-term.\nNote: For this exhibit, we assume that 100% of the cash is repatriated and 50% of it is spent on buybacks.

If the tax rate were lowered from 35%\nto 20% and the US moved to a territorial tax system (no longer taxing foreign profits),\nall else equal, we estimate an initial boost to S&P 500 EPS of 12% ($17 to 2018 EPS).\nHowever, over time, some of this benefit could be passed on to customers via lower\nprices — for instance, it is unlikely that there will be any major long-lasting impact from\ntax reform for Utilities sector profits, as any benefit/cost would likely be passed through\nto customers when incorporated into each company's regulated pricing. The benefit\nwould also be offset by some of the other changes discussed in subsequent sections.\nWe assume that S&P 500 companies would be able to retain half of the benefit, or\nroughly $8 of 2018E EPS. Below, we show the estimated EPS impacts on each sector\nbased on a tax rate of 20%.\n4 Equity Strategy Focus Point | 29 January 2017\nChart 1: Sector EPS estimated impact from 20% rate\n0% 2% 4% 6% 8% 10% 12% 14% 16% 18% 20%\nFinancials\nDiscretionary\nTelecom\nStaples\nIndustrials\nHealth Care\nEnergy\nMaterials\nInfo Tech\nReal Estate\n2%\n4%\n8%\n10%\n10%\n14%\n12%\n12%\n16%\n18%\nSource: BofAML US Equity & Quant Strategy, FactSet, S&P\nWhile the effective tax rate of the S&P 500 is generally about 28% (currently closer to\n25% due to the recent commodity recession), we estimate that the tax rate for the S&P\n500’s domestic operations is much higher at roughly 33% — although this includes\nstate and local taxes. If all companies with tax rates above the proposed new tax rate of\n20% were to drop to 20%, and no companies provisioned for US taxes on foreign\nprofits, we estimate the domestic effective tax rate for the S&P 500 would fall in line\nwith its foreign tax rate of roughly 19%. This would represent a 9ppt decrease in the\ncurrent S&P 500 tax rate and a 12% increase in EPS. We show the sensitivity to S&P\n500 EPS to different assumed tax rates in the chart below, but we reiterate that these\nestimates exaggerate the actual impact on profits, as a significant portion of these\nbenefits would likely be passed on to consumers via lower prices. We assume that in\naggregate, roughly half of the gains from the lower tax rate would be retained (i.e. half\nof the amounts shown in the sensitivity analysis in Chart 2).\nTable 5: Impact of 20% domestic corporate tax rate\nSector Current tax rate New tax rate Change\nDiscretionary 30% 19% -12ppt\nStaples 29% 20% -9ppt\nEnergy 41% 32% -9ppt\nFinancials 33% 21% -11ppt\nHealth Care 25% 16% -9ppt\nIndustrials 32% 23% -9ppt\nInfo Tech 18% 14% -4ppt\nMaterials 28% 23% -5ppt\nReal Estate 9% 7% -2ppt\nTelecom 29% 20% -9ppt\nUtilities 32% 20% -12ppt\nS&P 500 28% 19% -9ppt\nSource: BofAML US Equity & Quant Strategy, FactSet, S&P\n* Current tax rates may differ from other sources, as this analysis is based on companies’ 5-yr median\nfiscal year domestic and foreign tax data from annual filings.\nChart 2: Benefit to 2018 S&P 500 EPS from lower tax rates\n20%\n15%\n10%\n5%\n0%\n$10.50 $8.00\n15% 20% 25%\nNew Corporate Tax Rate\nEstimated impact on 2018 EPS\n$5.00\nSource: BofAML US Equity & Quant Strategy\nNote: Our base case assumes that half of the benefit would be passed on to customers, competed\naway or offset by other changes to the tax code.

Many multinationals’ foreign earnings thus remain parked offshore,\nallowing corporations to avoid the tax hit associated with bringing them back to the US.\nBoth Trump and the House (under Ryan) have proposed a mandatory tax of overseas\nearnings of US firms’ foreign subsidiaries at reduced rates, such that this cash can be\nbrought back and put to work in the US. This differs from the 2004 repatriation tax\nholiday, which was optional.\nUnder the Blueprint, accumulated overseas earnings will be subject to a transition tax of\n8.75% 1 (for those held in cash/cash equivalents) or 3.5% (for all other holdings), with\ncompanies able to pay the tax liability over an eight-year period. This would be part of\nbroader tax reform, where a proposed territorial tax system would exempt companies’\nforeign income from US taxes and prevent future buildup of overseas profits as\ncompanies would be free to bring them home. Trump’s plan calls for a one-time deemed\nrepatriation of overseas corporate profits at a 10% tax rate.\nTable 6: Blueprint vs. Trump tax plans for taxing offshore earnings of US firms’ foreign subsidiaries\nPlan\nTax rate on accumulated overseas earnings\nBlueprint\n8.75% for cash/cash equivalents, 3.5% of all other holdings\nTrump tax plan 10%\nSource: donaldjtrump.com, abetterway.speaker.gov\nThe Tax Policy Center estimates that a repatriation tax holiday would generate\napproximately $150bn in tax receipts under Trump’s plan (over 10 years) and $140bn\n1\nNote: The effective tax rates of 8.75% and 3.5% under the Blueprint are based on an allowable deduction of 75% (for\ndeferred earnings held in cash/liquid assets) or 90% (for the non-cash portion), with the remainder taxed at the US\ncorporate tax rate, i.e. 35%(1-75%) = 8.75% and 35%(1-90%) = 3.5%. This methodology was proposed by Dave Camp’s\n(former chairman of the House Committee on Ways and Means) Tax Reform Act of 2014.\n6 Equity Strategy Focus Point | 29 January 2017\nunder the Blueprint (over eight years). The Tax Foundation similarly estimates that a\nrepatriation act could drive spending amounting to $185-200bn in revenues through\n2025, which could help fund infrastructure/defense spending.\nS&P 500 companies could bring back over $1tn – mostly in Tech & Health Care\nOur FX team has written that US corporates in aggregate (including Financials) hold\n~$2tn in cash overseas, and their work suggests that nearly half is concentrated within\n20 companies. Similarly, as we discuss below, half of the repatriated cash following the\n2004 Homeland Investment Act came from just 15 companies, predominantly in Pharma\nand Tech. Our own analysis of the S&P 500 (based on filings and estimates from our\nanalysts) suggests that non-Financials in the S&P hold approximately $1.2tn overseas,\nnearly three-quarters of which is in Tech and Health Care (Chart 4).\nChart 4: Estimated overseas cash as a % of mkt. cap by sector for the S&P 500 (excludes Financials\nand Real Estate)\nOverseas cash as a % of market cap\n16%\n14%\n12%\n10%\n8%\n6%\n4%\n2%\n0%\nTech\nHealth Care\nIndustrials\nS&P 500 ex.

This deduction could be claimed in the tax year\nbeginning before or after the passage date in Oct. 2004. Approximately $300bn was\nrepatriated, according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA)’s U.S. International\nTransactions Accounts Data, vs. an average of $60bn over the prior five years. The IRS\nestimates 2 that 843 US companies took advantage of the act.\nDespite HIA’s intent; most repatriated cash was spent on buybacks/dividends\nDespite the U.S. Treasury Department’s guidelines that repatriated earnings should be\nspent on capital investment, R&D, M&A, and other pro-growth uses such as hiring, this\nwas not ultimately the result: the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER)\nestimates 3 that $0.92 of every $1.00 brought back was used to return cash to\nshareholders ($0.79 for buybacks and $0.15 for dividends) 4 , and that repatriation\nultimately did not lead to a pick-up in capex, employment or R&D.

Valuations were generally more\nattractive in 2004-2005 on most metrics (Table 9), and we’ve found that buybacks tend\nto be more rewarded when stocks are cheap (Chart 8). Additionally, the largest buybacks\nhave not generated alpha for the last several years, as investors have increasingly\nagitated for companies to use their excess cash on pro-growth investments (namely\ncapex.) According to BofAML’s latest Global Fund Manager Survey, 60% of investors\nwant companies to increase capex spending, vs. 17% who want companies to return\ncash to shareholders (Exhibit 1). This compares to a majority of investors desiring\ncompanies to return cash to shareholders when the HIA was passed in late 2004.\nCompanies may also feel less pressure to bolster per share metrics by reducing share\ncount if top line is recovering and organic growth is finally materializing. And from a\ncapital structure perspective, if leverage loses its tax benefit, given that leverage ratios\nare already high (see below) companies may be less likely to reduce their equity capital\nbase, as that would marginally increase their weighted average cost of capital.\nSpecial dividends, pay-down of debt may be other likely uses\nCompanies may also return the cash to shareholders by issuing a one-time special\ndividend: income remains in-demand, given that both interest rates and dividend payout\nratios remain historically low. And if a repatriation tax holiday comes within the context\nof broader tax reform that includes an end to the deductibility of interest expense,\ncompanies may choose to pay down debt over other uses of cash, in an attempt to skew\ntheir balance sheets less toward debt and more toward equity (see the section on no\nEquity Strategy Focus Point | 29 January 2017 9\ninterest tax shield later in this report). Deleveraging balance sheets may also be spurred\nby a continued environmwnt of rising interest. Leverage for S&P non-Financials has\nsteadily been ticking up over the last few years, and, if we exclude the cash-rich\nTechnology sector, leverage is approaching all-time highs (Chart 9).\nTable 9: S&P 500 valuations: October 2004 vs. today\nMetric 10/31/2004 Today (12/31/16)\nFwd P/E 15.6 16.9\nTrailing P/E 16.7 22.0\nMedian Fwd P/E 16.2 17.3\nP/B 2.8 2.9\nEV/EBITDA 11.6 11.7\nP/S 1.5 2.0\nEV/Sales 2.2 2.3\nSource: FactSet, S&P, BofA Merrill Lynch US Equity & US Quant Strategy\nChart 8: Average Annual Return of Russell 1000 Top Quintiles by factor\n(1986-present)\n16%\n14%\n12%\n10%\n8%\n10.0%\n11.7%\n13.5%\nBenchmark High Share Repurchase INEXPENSIVE\nCompanies with High\nShare Repurchase\nNote: valuation factor used to determine inexpensive companies is FCF/P\nSource: FactSet,, BofA Merrill Lynch US Equity & US Quant Strategy\nExhibit 1: BofAML Global Fund Manager Survey (January 2017): What\nwould you most like to see companies do with cash flow?\nChart 9: Net Debt/EBITDA for the S&P 500 ex Financials (and excluding\nEnergy and Tech)\n3.5\n3.0\n2.5\n2.0\n1.5\nSource: BofA Merrill Lynch Global Fund Manager Survey (17 January 2017)\n1.0\n86 88 90 92 94 96 98 00 02 04 06 08 10 12 14 16\nS&P 500 ex Financials\nS&P 500 ex Fins. & Energy\nAvg.\nS&P 500 ex Fins. & Tech\nSource: FactSet, BofA Merrill Lynch US Equity & US Quant Strategy\nPotential EPS impacts\n$8-9 (6-7%) hit to GAAP EPS from the mandatory tax on accumulated overseas\nprofit\nWe estimate that a tax of accumulated overseas profits of $1.2tn would result in a cash\ntax impact of $100-120bn (which may be allowed to be paid over 8-10 years), and a\none-time hit to GAAP EPS of $8-9 (a lower $65-80bn, given that a several large\nmultinationals such as AAPL already provision for US taxes on a portion of their\noverseas profit, resulting in effective US tax rates well above the US statutory rate).

This may result in upward\npressure on the USD (which they estimate could amount to $250-$400bn if half of all\noffshore cash, which they estimate at ~$2tn, was repatriated). Their analysis of the\nEUR-USD during the last repatriation holiday suggests an “announcement effect” is\nlikely, as the dollar strengthened ahead of the bulk of the actual repatriation flows.\nRepatriation could put upward pressure on bank funding costs\nOur rates team’s analysis of some of the largest multinationals with offshore cash\nsuggests ~70% of cash is invested in securities with maturities greater than one year,\nwith the remaining 30% having shorter maturities. See table below. They believe\nrepatriation could put upward pressure on bank funding costs as firms reduce their\nholdings in these short-term investments. According to Crane Data on offshore money\nfund holdings, our rates team cites that $161bn of offshore funds are held in commercial\npaper and CDs, of which the majority are from financial institutions with Japan, France and\nCanada the largest issuers.\nTable 14: Offshore holdings and investment allocation for select firms\n(see footnote) per BofAML Rates team (as published 12/9/2016)\nAllocation*\nCash & MMF 8%\nCP & CD 5%\nTsy & Agy 35%\nCorporate 36%\nNon-US Sov 4%\nOther 12%\nMaturity of securities holdings**\n<1y 28%\n1-5y 59%\n5-10y 7%\n>10y 6%\n*Allocation = weighted avg of holdings across all company investments for AAPL, MSFT, CSCO, ORCL,\nGOOG, MRK, INTC and PFE. **Maturities = weighted avg. of holdings from MSFT, CSCO, GOOG, INTC.\nSource: BofAML Global Research, company 10Q’s\nExhibit 2: Offshore money fund USD asset holdings ($bn) as of 9/30/16\nSource: Crane data, BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research\nPotential beneficiaries: See Table 20 for a screen of companies with high (>10%)\noverseas cash to market capitalization ratios which could potentially benefit from\nrepatriation.\nBorder adjustment tax analysis\nA new tax policy outlined in the Blueprint proposal that has been getting a lot of\nattention recently is the border adjustment tax, or the application of border adjustments\nto a company’s imports and exports. While Trump has described the proposal as being\n“too complicated,” it is a key component of the Blueprint plan and should not be\nignored. Additionally, White House press secretary Sean Spicer’s recent reference to\n“…the plan taking shape right now, using comprehensive tax reform as a means to tax\nimports from countries…” could be a sign that Trump is not as against the proposal his\nother comments would indicate.\n12 Equity Strategy Focus Point | 29 January 2017\nThis policy would effectively result in the tax authorities recognizing all sales that take\nplace in the US (regardless of where they are produced) and all the domestic costs\nincurred to produce goods and services for customers (regardless of where the sale\ntakes place). As a result, net importers (such as many retailers) would suffer, as they\nwould have to pay taxes on their domestic sales without being able to deduct a\nsignificant portion of their costs of production. Conversely, net exporters (companies\nwith much of their production in the US but sales outside of the US) would stand to\nbenefit from not having to pay taxes on their foreign sales while being able to deduct a\nsignificant proportion of production costs (Exhibit 3). Purely domestic companies would\nbe unaffected.\nExhibit 3: Illustration of border adjustment treatment of US corporate taxation\nUS\nSold in the US:\nRecognize sales\nMade in the US:\nDeduct costs\nSold overseas:\nIgnore sales\nNon-US\nSold overseas:\nIgnore sales\nMade in the US:\nDeduct costs\nSold in the US:\nRecognize sales\nMade overseas:\nMade overseas: Can’t deduct costs\nCan’t deduct costs\nSource: BofA Merrill Lynch US Equity & US Quant Strategy\nEven if border adjustments are enacted, there is significant uncertainty around\nimplementation details. For this analysis, we focus on the first order impact of border\nadjustments, but we recognize there would be significant second order impacts on the\npricing of products, pricing within the supply chain, foreign exchange rates as well as\nforeign policy reactions. (We discuss many of these second order impacts later in this\nreport.) For the current exercise, we also ignored the cost of services as the\nimplementation of these rules would be more complicated. See the Methodology\nsection for more details.\nWe estimate that at a 20% tax rate, border adjustments would detract $5-6 from 2018\nEPS, with nearly 80% of the drag coming from the Consumer Discretionary and\nConsumer Staples sectors (roughly evenly split). This impact includes a 50% haircut to\naccount for offsets from alternate sourcing, currency rates and pricing power. On one\nhand, we may be drastically underestimating the impact because we have not included\nthe second order impacts on the supply chain. For example, many retailers source the\nbulk of their goods from domestic suppliers, who source their goods from overseas\nsuppliers. So while the original retailer may not feel the direct tax hit from importing\ngoods, the supplier that took the tax hit would likely pass along a significant portion of\nthis via a higher cost. On the other hand, the supplier or the retailer could look for\nalternate domestic sources for those products, but it would largely depend on whether\nthe cost differential of production between the US and overseas exceeded the border\nadjustment tax. Some key components in determining the cost differential are the\nforeign exchange rates (more on this below) and labor costs. In the end, the net impact\nof the border adjustment taxes will be driven by a complex interplay between corporate\ntax rates, pricing power, foreign exchange moves, foreign versus domestic availability\nand cost differentials.\nEquity Strategy Focus Point | 29 January 2017 13\nChart 10: Sector EPS impact from border\nadjustment tax (15% rate)\nStaples -23%\nDiscretionary -21%\nEnergy\n-8%\nHealth Care\n-4%\nInfo Tech\n-3%\nUtilities\n0%\nTelecom\n0%\nFinancials\n0%\nReal Estate\n0%\nIndustrials\n1%\nMaterials\n3%\n-30% -20% -10% 0% 10%\n15% tax rate\nSource: BofAML US Equity & Quant Strategy, FactSet, S&P\nChart 11: Sector EPS impact from border\nadjustment tax (20% rate)\nStaples -31%\nDiscretionary -28%\nEnergy\n-10%\nHealth Care\n-5%\nInfo Tech\n-4%\nUtilities\n0%\nTelecom\n0%\nFinancials\n0%\nReal Estate\n0%\nIndustrials\n1%\nMaterials\n4%\n-40% -30% -20% -10% 0% 10%\n20% tax rate\nSource: BofAML US Equity & Quant Strategy, FactSet, S&P\nChart 12: Sector EPS impact from border\nadjustment tax (25% rate)\nStaples -38%\nDiscretionary -35%\nEnergy\n-13%\nHealth Care\n-6%\nInfo Tech\n-5%\nUtilities\n0%\nTelecom\n0%\nFinancials\n0%\nReal Estate\n0%\nIndustrials\n2%\nMaterials\n5%\n-50% -40% -30% -20% -10% 0% 10%\n25% tax rate\nSource: BofAML US Equity & Quant Strategy, FactSet, S&P\nOffsetting BAT with a little math and some price increases\nA company could fully offset the border adjustment tax by raising prices such that the\nafter-tax increase in sales would exceed the drag from the lost deduction of costs. All\nelse equal, the break-even price increase would be equivalent to the cost of goods sold\nas a % of sales multiplied by net % imported and the tax to after-tax ratio, which at a\n20% rate is 0.25 (20%/80%).\nAs an example, a company with a 25% gross margin that imports 30% of its goods\nwould need to increase its prices by of 5-6% to offset the border adjustment tax, all\nelse equal.\nOffsetting BAT with FX\nSome of the increase in the after-tax cost of imported goods can also be offset by a\nstrengthening dollar. For example, companies producing goods in Mexico, which stand to\nsee a 25% increase in the cost of imported goods, should see the cost increase partially\noffset by the 13% devaluation of the Mexican Peso against the US dollar since the\nelection. The net cost increase is a more digestible 9%, especially when you also\nconsider that the Peso has devalued nearly 30% since its 2013 peak. While it may offer\nlittle consolation to corporates, the US Dollar Index is up over 25% since mid-2014, so\nthe border adjustment tax would presumably act as a reversal of the lowered cost of\noverseas production over that period.\nBorder adjustment sensitivity analysis\nThe table below illustrates how the change in the tax rate and the application of the\nborder adjustment tax would impact the domestic earnings of a hypothetical company\nwith sensitivity to different tax rates and net export assumptions. We assumed the\ncompany has a 40% gross margin, operating expenses are 20% of sales and an initial\ntax rate of 35%. As you would expect, the biggest benefit would accrue to companies\nwith significant net exports at a high domestic tax rate (bigger tax shield) and the most\nnegative impact to significant net imports at a high domestic tax rate (higher taxes on\nhigher taxable income).\n14 Equity Strategy Focus Point | 29 January 2017\nTable 15: Sensitivity of a company’s domestic earnings\nNet exports (% of COGS)\nTax rate -100% -50% 0% 50% 100%*\n15% -38% -4% 31% 65% 100%\n18% -54% -13% 27% 67% 108%\n20% -69% -23% 23% 69% 115%\n23% -85% -33% 19% 71% 123%\n25% -100% -42% 15% 73% 131%\n28% -115% -52% 12% 75% 138%\n30% -131% -62% 8% 77% 146%\n33% -146% -71% 4% 79% 154%\n35% -162% -81% 0% 81% 162%\nSource: BofAML US Equity & Quant Strategy\n*We note that it is unlikely that a company can be a 100% net exporter and have any domestic earnings to begin with.\nNote: We assume a company with a 40% gross margin, operating expenses are 20% of sales and an initial tax rate of 35%\nIndustry screen: Below we highlight industries which could potentially\nbenefit most / be hurt most by the BAT.\nChart 13: Industry EPS impact from border\nadjustment tax (15% rate)\n-100% -50% 0% 50%\nIndustrial Conglomerates\nLife Sciences Tools & Svcs\nChemicals\nHousehold Products\nMachinery\nHealth Care Technology\nElectrical Equipment\nMedia\nIT Svcs\nEnergy Equipment & Svcs\nBiotechnology\n-1%\nSemiconductors & Sem Equip\n-2%\nSoftware\n-2%\nPharmaceuticals\n-2%\nTrading Cos & Distributors\n-3%\nHealth Care Equipment &…\n-4%\nMetals & Mining\n-5%\nBuilding Products\n-5%\nElectronic Equip Instr &…\n-6%\nConstruction Materials\n-6%\nOil Gas & Consumable Fuels\n-9%\nCommunications Equipment\n-9%\nTech Hardware\n-9%\nHealth Care Providers & Svcs\n-11%\nHousehold Durables\n-12%\nAuto Components\n-20%\nLeisure Products -30%\nSpecialty Retail -33%\nDistributors -38%\nTextiles Apparel & Luxury Goods -39%\nInternet & Direct Mktg Retail -41%\nAutomobiles -41%\nMultiline Retail -49%\nFood & Staples Retailing -74%\n5%\n4%\n4%\n3%\n3%\n2%\n2%\n2%\n1%\n1%\nChart 14: Industry EPS impact from border\nadjustment tax (20% rate)\n-150% -100% -50% 0% 50%\nIndustrial Conglomerates\nChemicals\nLife Sciences Tools & Svcs\nHousehold Products\nMachinery\nHealth Care Technology\nElectrical Equipment\nMedia\nIT Svcs\nEnergy Equipment & Svcs\nBiotechnology\n-1%\nSemiconductors & Sem Equip\n-2%\nSoftware\n-3%\nPharmaceuticals\n-3%\nTrading Cos & Distributors\n-3%\nHealth Care Equipment &…\n-5%\nMetals & Mining\n-7%\nBuilding Products\n-7%\nElectronic Equip Instr &…\n-8%\nConstruction Materials\n-9%\nOil Gas & Consumable Fuels\n-12%\nTech Hardware\n-12%\nCommunications Equipment\n-12%\nHealth Care Providers & Svcs\n-14%\nHousehold Durables\n-16%\nAuto Components\n-21%\nLeisure Products\n-40%\nSpecialty Retail\n-45%\nDistributors\n-51%\nTextiles Apparel & Luxury Goods\n-52%\nInternet & Direct Mktg Retail -54%\nAutomobiles -55%\nMultiline Retail -65%\nFood & Staples Retailing -99%\n7%\n5%\n5%\n4%\n4%\n3%\n3%\n2%\n2%\n1%\nChart 15: Industry EPS impact from border\nadjustment tax (25% rate)\nIndustrial Conglomerates\nChemicals\nLife Sciences Tools & Svcs\nMachinery\nHousehold Products\nHealth Care Technology\nElectrical Equipment\nMedia\nIT Svcs\nEnergy Equipment & Svcs\nBiotechnology\nSemiconductors & Sem Equip\nSoftware\nPharmaceuticals\nTrading Cos & Distributors\nHealth Care Equipment &…\nElectronic Equip Instr &…\nMetals & Mining\nBuilding Products\nConstruction Materials\nTech Hardware\nOil Gas & Consumable Fuels\nCommunications Equipment\nHealth Care Providers & Svcs\nHousehold Durables\nAuto Components\nLeisure Products\nSpecialty Retail\nDistributors\nTextiles Apparel & Luxury Goods\nInternet & Direct Mktg Retail\nAutomobiles\nMultiline Retail\nFood & Staples Retailing\n-200% -150% -100% -50% 0% 50%\n-2%\n-3%\n-3%\n-4%\n-4%\n-6%\n-8%\n-9%\n-9%\n-11%\n-14%\n-15%\n-15%\n-18%\n-20%\n-21%\n-50%\n-56%\n-64%\n-65%\n-68%\n-69%\n-81%\n-124%\n8%\n6%\n6%\n5%\n5%\n4%\n4%\n3%\n2%\n2%\n15% tax rate\n20% tax rate\n25% tax rate\nSource: BofAML US Equity & Quant Strategy, FactSet, S&P\nSource: BofAML US Equity & Quant Strategy, FactSet, S&P\nSource: BofAML US Equity & Quant Strategy, FactSet, S&P\nClosing loopholes\nBoth Trump and the Blueprint proposal suggest getting rid of special-interest\ndeductions and credits that distort capital allocation decisions.

Similarly, the accelerated depreciation of\nmachinery & equipment would become irrelevant due to the move toward taxation\nbased on business cash flow and the immediate write-off of capital expenditures. Once\nthe depreciation from legacy investments has run off, then depreciation should become\nirrelevant for tax purposes. We also highlight the deduction for US production activities\n(section 199) due to it being specifically highlighted by the Blueprint proposal as no\nlonger being necessary under the new tax policies.

We assume that this rule would apply to new debt\nand that existing debt would be grandfathered. This tax shield removal would increase\nthe cost of debt by an incremental 25% (not to mention the 100bp+ rise in long-term\ninterest rates seen since the summer of 2016). In the table below, we illustrate the\nimpact on S&P 500 corporate profits. We estimate that over time, the removal of the\ninterest rate deduction would detract about 4%, or $4-5 from S&P 500 2018 EPS,\nalthough the initial impact would be less significant given 70-90% of the debt is long\nterm.\nTable 17: Estimated EPS impact from the removal of interest tax shield\nS&P 500 Non-Financials\nNet Debt ($mn) 2,899\nNet Debt/EBITDA 1.74\nNew tax rate 20%\nAfter-tax interest rate [interest rate w/ no tax shield * (1 - new tax rate)] 4.2%\nInterest rate w/ no tax shield [interest expense / net debt] 5.2%\nChange in cost of debt [(interest rate w/ no tax shield / after-tax interest rate) -1] 25%\nPotential profit impact (%) [(interest rate w/) no tax shield - after-tax interest rate) * (net debt / net income)] 4%\nPotential impact on 2018 EPS $4-5\nSource: BofAML US Equity & US Quant Strategy, S&P, FactSet\nMany investors assume that interest deductions would likely apply only to new debt, and\nif this were the case, the drag would be gradual for the overall S&P 500 as debt matures\nand is refinanced. Companies have shifted the composition of their debt toward longer\nmaturities and fixed rates. We estimate an average S&P 500 debt maturity of over eight\nyears, with just one-third maturing within the next three years. The grandfathering of\nexisting debt is a reasonable assumption, but not a sure thing, in our view. There is a\npossibility that legislators apply it to all debt on the grounds that most companies are\nexpected to be net beneficiaries of comprehensive tax reform.\nThere is also a possibility that this policy is phased in over a number of years, with\ncertain portions of the existing debt losing their interest deductibility over time.\nChart 17: Russell 1000 debt by type and\nmaturity - 2007\nST\nFloating,\n23.3%\nLT\nFloating,\n19.7%\nST\nFixed,\n2.8%\nSource: FactSet, BofAML US Equity & US Quant Strategy\nLT\nFixed,\n54.2%\nChart 18: Russell 1000 debt by type and\nmaturity - October 2016\nST\nFloating,\n15.3%\nLT\nFloating,\n14.0%\nST\nFixed,\n4.1%\nLT\nFixed,\n66.6%\nSource: FactSet, BofAML US Equity & US Quant Strategy\nTable 18: Russell 1000 estimated weighted\naverage debt maturity (ex-Financials & REITs)\nSector Estimated Wtd Avg Maturity (years)\nCons.

If a tax holiday is also granted, that might offset the loss of benefit.\nCompanies that regularly issue long-term debt may choose to reduce that burden to\noffset the tax change, and find those funds elsewhere. We find it unlikely that the\nchange would result in a surge in equity issuance, unless the change applies to existing\ndebt, which is unlikely in our view. While this change should be taken as a line item in a\nwholistic bill, there are victims and beneficiaries here. Corporations that have high\nleverage ratios, low retained earnings, high interest expense to earnings ratios, no cash\noverseas offset from repatriation, and those that have recurring long-term debt needs\nmay be most at risk.\nOther implications\nWhile some argue that companies will try to raise outsized amounts of investment grade\ncapital ahead of the deadline to lock in funding with the tax benefit before the loophole\nis closed, there is a reasonable chance that a provision is included in the legislation that\nwould treat such debt as new debt. In our Investment Grade Strategist Hans Mikkelsen’s\nview, demand for IG credit could be materially reduced over time. The tax change could\nalso dampen Leverage Buyout (LBO) activity, according to our High Yield strategist\nMichael Contopoulos, where these funds are already struggling to generate high returns\n– note that LBO funds are currently sitting on close to $1tn in cash looking for a home,\naccording to Preqin’s third quarter update.\nWho could be hurt: See Table 21 for a screen of stocks with high net interest\nexpense as a percentage of net income which could potentially be hurt most by an\nend to the deductibility of interest expense.\n18 Equity Strategy Focus Point | 29 January 2017\nTax reform screens\nLower US corporate tax rate: potential beneficiaries\nBelow we provide a screen of domestically-oriented S&P 500 companies (<10% foreign\nsales exposure) with a high (>35%) median 5-year effective tax rate which could\npotentially benefit most from a lower US corporate tax rate.\nTable 19: S&P 500 companies with high (>35%) median 5-year effective tax rates and low (<10%) foreign sales\nTicker Company Name Sector Industry\nForeign Sales\n%\n5-Year Median Effective Tax\nRate %\nCHTR Charter Communications, Inc.

We estimate that 100% is brought back given that the tax is\nmandatory. To compute the one-time tax impact to GAAP EPS, we divide the cumulative\ntax impact by the S&P 500 divisor, after first excluding the impact from several large\nmultinationals (e.g. AAPL) which already provision a portion of their overseas profits for\nUS taxes and have effective US tax rates well above 35%.\nNote that for companies for which our analysts provided estimates, we asked them to\nprovide cumulative overseas profits if possible, but in most cases this number reflects\noverseas cash. Thus, taxes paid could be slightly higher than we estimate given that\nboth the Blueprint and Trump’s plans suggest a mandatory tax on all accumulated\noverseas profits, some of which may be permanently reinvested; here, the Blueprint\nsuggests a lower 3.5% tax for retained earnings not held in cash/equivalents, suggesting\nthat any additional taxes payable that we are not capturing are likely to be small.\nTo calculate the % EPS impact from buybacks, we subtract the amount of taxes payable\nfrom total cash brought back for the S&P 500 ex. Financials & Real Estate (and for each\nsector) and divide this by the market cap for the S&P 500 (and for each sector.) We\nmultiply this % impact for the overall index by our 2018E EPS of $137 to determine the\npotential EPS impact, applying various buyback scenarios (10-100%). We use 50% as a\nbase case scenario, which is lower than the 80% brought back during the 2004 tax\nholiday, to be conservative.\nBorder adjustments impact on EPS\nWe estimate the costs of goods imported and exported for each company using the\nlatest company filings, conversations with analysts, industry research, management\ncommentary and the Input-Output accounts data published by the U.S. Department of\nCommerce. For more information about the Input-Output accounts data, please refer to\nthe Bureau of Economic Analysis website at http://www.bea.gov/industry/io_annual.htm.\nWhen using the estimates based on Input-Output accounts, we adjust them to account\nfor the varying foreign exposures of different S&P 500 industries. For companies that\nsource products through importers (e.g. retailers), we only included the costs of goods\nestimated to be directly imported by each company, as taxes pertaining to those\nimported goods should be paid by the importers themselves.\nWe estimate the earnings impact of border adjustments based on the additional taxes\nthat companies would pay on the costs of imported goods sold in the US (nondeductible)\nand any reduction in taxes related to the production costs for exported\ngoods (deductible). To calculate this, we multiple the net value of imported COGS by the\nassumed tax rate. Note that the net impact can be either positive or negative depending\non whether the company is a net importer or exporter. We assume a 50% haircut to the\nimpact to account for from alternate sourcing, currency rates and pricing power.\nLower corporate tax rate impact on EPS\nWe estimate the normalized effective domestic tax rate of a company based on\nconversations with the analysts or the median 5-year domestic income tax rate. If a\ncompany had a negative tax rate for a particular year, we exclude the tax rate of that\n24 Equity Strategy Focus Point | 29 January 2017\nyear from the median calculation. For companies with normalized tax rates of more than\n75%, we assume 35%.\nThe impact of a lower corporate tax rate on company earnings is directly proportional to\nthe difference between the current domestic tax rate and the proposed tax rate. The\nimpact is calculated by taking the difference between the current tax rate and the\nproposed tax rate, and dividing it by (1-current tax rate).\nTo calculate the impact of a lower corporate tax rate on the S&P 500 earnings, we can\ndivide the change in the effective tax rate by (1 – the current effective tax rate).\nInterest deductibility impact\nWe estimate the cost associated with the removal of the net interest expense deduction\nfrom taxable income by multiplying the net interest expense by the tax rate.\nEquity Strategy Focus Point | 29 January 2017 25\nDisclosures\nImportant Disclosures\nBofA Merrill Lynch Research Personnel (including the analyst(s) responsible for this report) receive compensation based upon, among other factors, the overall profitability of Bank of America\nCorporation, including profits derived from investment banking.

Systems fulfilling the criteria for\na chaotic dynamical system have the property of a countably infinite number of\nunstable periodic orbits composed of these unstable fixed points. Depending upon\nparameters, the orbital points can pull up their tails to be discrete with respect to\neach other or spread along the unstable direction to connect smoothly with others\nalong a curve such as a saddle cycle.

When I\ndiscussed the chronology of the copied documents with a former government official briefed on\nthe investigation, he suggested that Snowden’s purpose may have changed between 2012 and\n2013. When I asked him what might have induced the change, he replied “That is one of the\nunanswered questions.” That Snowden only took these two whistle-blowing documents at the\ntail-end of his 9-month operation, and after he had contacted Poitras and Greenwald, suggests he\nmay have had another motive prior to contacting journalists. In light of this chronology, the\ninvestigation had to consider the possibility that his whistle-blowing was, partly if not wholly, a\ncover for another enterprise.\n\nThe investigation soon ran into another serious issue: his access. Snowden had described to\njournalists a situation in which he had access to“ millions of records that [he] could walk out the\ndoor with at any time with no accountability, no oversight, no auditing, the government didn’t\neven know they were gone,” but, as it turned out, he was not among the limited number of\nindividuals at the Center who had access to these documents, The NSA’s and Booz Allen’s\nemployment records showed that Snowden had not yet completed his requisite on-the- job\ntraining at the National Threat Operations Center in Hawaii when he carried out the theft.\nConsequently, he had not yet been provided with the passwords he needed to get the documents.\nA former NSA official bluntly told me that Snowden, at least during the period of the thefts in\nApril and May 2013, had no more legitimate access to the compartments than the cleaning\npersonnel at the Center. Somehow he converted his proximity to access.\n\nThis lack of access could not be ignored in any law-enforcement investigation. Consider if a\n\nhundred top-quality D-flawless diamonds were stolen from locked vaults at Tiffany’s by a recently-\nhired trainee who, it turned out, did not have either the combination to open these vaults. One\npossibility that the police would be expected to consider was that the trainee might have had help\nfrom a current or former insider at the company who knew the combinations. Snowden had\naccomplished a similar inexplicable feat as the hypothetical jewel thief.\n\nIn Snowden’s case, the FBI had to consider two very different possibilities that could explain\nhow he could have acquired the password. He said in his video confession that he was solely\nresponsible but there was another possibility. He had help, unwitting or witting, from others and\nhe was trying to protect away from them.\n\nThe FBI faced a dilemma. It could either assume that the NSA’s security regime was so badly\nflawed that Snowden could trick his fellow workers into providing him with access or that there\nwas another individual at the Center who might have assisted or directed Snowden. If it pursued\nthe former hypothesis, it could close the case as far as the sitting Grand Jury was concerned.\nAfter all, Snowden had admitted he was the perpetrator and, if further evidence was needed, he\ncould be seen showing stolen documents to Greenwald on the video. And Greenwald later used\nthese documents. For the Grand Jury, it was, as one former federal prosecutor put it, “a slam\ndunk.” Not even Snowden denied the charge that he gave secret documents to individuals that\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_020189\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

BROWN\nMiami Herald\n\nThree months have passed since a\njudicial panel in New York heard argu-\nments to unseal documents that could\nreveal whether federal prosecutors\ncovered up evidence that New ‘York fi-\nnancier Jeffrey Epstein and others were\nrunning an underage sex trafficking\noperation.\n\nIn| March, the\nUnited States\nCourt of Appeals\nfor the Second Cir-\ncuit seemed poised\nto rdease some\ndocuments in the\ncase. The records\ninvolve Epstein’s\none-time partner,\nGhislaine = Max-\nwell, who has been\naccused of helping him recruit and sex-\nually exploit girls and young women\nin various locations around the United\nStates and abroad in the late 1990s and\nearly 2000s.\n\nThe appeals panel gave all parties in\nthe case until March 29 to file addition-\nal pleadings. Several challenges were\n\nJeffrey Epstein\n\nsubsequently filed, but the court has yet\ntomake a final ruling.\n\nThe Miami Herald — one of the in-\ntervenors in the case — has submitted\na letter to the court unging the judges to\nfollow through on the case in the wake\nof a controversial Justice Department\ndecision last week. In a 35-page mo-\ntion, filed June 24, federal prosecutors\nin Georgia declared that they would not\nset aside Epstein’s federal non-prosecu-\ntion agreement.\n\nThe Georgia decision dealt another\nblow to Epstein’s victims who have\nbeen fighting for a decade to have the\ndeal thrown out and to pressure the\nJustice Department to prosecute the\n66-year-old multimillionaire on sex\ntrafficking charges. It also means that\nthe Justice Department has no intention\nof allowing Epstein’s victims and the\npublic to examine the facts of Epstein’:\ncase and reach their own conclusions,\nthe Herald argues in the letter.\n\nIn February, a federal judge in Flor-\nida, Kenneth A. Marra, ruled in the\nvictims’ favor, saying that the govern-\nment violated the Crime Victims’ Right\nAct when it failed to inform Epstein’\nvictims that prosecutors had secretly\ndisposed of the case.\n\nMarra ordered the govemment and\nattomeys for the victims to come up\nwith remedies to address the federal\nviolation.\n\nU.S. Attomey Byung Pak responded\nlast week, saying that Epstein’s victims\nare free to express their displeasure\nabout what prosecutors dic, but they\nhave no right under the law to demand\nanything from the government — not\neven an apology.\n\nSanford L. Bohrer, the Miami Her\nald’s attorney, said that Pak’s decision\nhighlights the pressing need for the New\nYork appeals court to expedite unsealing\nthe documents in Maxwell's case.\n\nThat case is a 2015 defamation law-\nsuit filed against Maxwell, the daughter\nof the late Bntish media mogul Robert\nMaxwell. Maxwell, now 37 and an envi-\nronmentalist, has been accused of assist-\ning Epstein in the trafficking of under\nage girls and young women to powerful\nand wealthy politicians, lawyers, scien-\ntists and businessmen.\n\nShe has denied the allegations and has\nnever been charged with any crimes.\n\nThe Herald’s lawyer contends that\nthe Justice Department's decision last\nweek shows that the government con-\ntinues to evade public accountabil-\n\nVIRGIN ISLANDS\n\nARMY\nNATIONAL\n\nGUARD\n*\n\nity and, therefore, it's more urgent than\never that the Maxwell case be made\npublic.\n\n“[Pak’s] submission makes clear that\naccess to the documents that [the Her-\nald and other parties] seek in [the Max-\nwell] matter remains an issue of critical\npublic concern,” Bohrer wrote ina let-\nter to Catherine O\" Hagan Wolfe, clerk\nof the court for the appeals panel. He\nsaid the government “essentially argues\nthat Epstein’s victims are not entitled to\nany meaningful redress, including par-\ntial rescission, declaratory relief and\nspecific injunctive relief requested.”\n\nIn 2008, the FBI had identified near-\nly three dozen underage victims who\nwere allegedly lured to Epstein’s man-\nsion in Palm Beach under the pretext\nthat he would pay them for massages.\nThe girls, mostly 13 to 16 years old\nwere groomed by Epstein and others\nwho worked for him to engage in sex.\nacts with him and others, the evidence\nshowed.\n\nIn November, the Miami Herald\npublished an investigation that exam-\nined how then-Miami U.S. Attomey\nAlexander Acosta negotiated a secret\nnon-prosecution agreement that re-\nsulted in Epstein receiving an extraor-\ndinanly light sentence.\n\nAcosta, who is now President\nDonald Trump’s labor secretary,\nensured that the agreement was\nsealed so that no one — not even the\nvictims — would know the scope\nof Epstein’s crimes or who was in-\nvolved. Epstein’s lawyers worked to-\ngether with prosecutors to limit pub-\nlic scrutiny of the case, and arranged\nfor Epstein to quietly plead guilty to\nlesser charges in state court, the Her-\nald series revealed.\n\nThe handling of the case is now under\ninvestigation by the Department of Justice.\n\nAs part of the Herald’s senes, the\nnewspaper went to court in 2018 to\nunseal the Maxwell case, which was\n\nWednesday, July 3, 2019\n\nsettled in 2017. A contingent of other\nmedia companies, aconservative social\nmedia blogger and Epstein’s lawyer,\nAlan Dershowitz, are also seeking to\nhave the Maxwell case made public.\n\nThe defamation case was filed against\nMaxwell by Virginia Roberts Giuffre,\nwho claims she was recruited by Max-\nwell when she was 16 and working as\naspa attendant at Mar-a-Lago, Trump's\nlavish country club in Palm Beach. In\ncourt papers, she Claimed that Epstein\nand Maxwell directed her to have sex\nwith public figures. In a sworn affida-\nwit, she has named Prince Andrew and\nDershowitz as among those she had sex\nwith when she was underage. Both the\nprince and the famed lawyer have de-\nnied her claims.\n\nDershowitz wants the Maxwell case\nmade public because he says that the\ndocuments will exonerate him. Also\nparty to the appeal is social media blog-\nger Michael Cernovich.\n\nBased on the court filings, the case is\nbelieved to contain a range of evidence,\nincluding testimony from other pos-\nsible underage victims who were traf-\nficked. All parties inthe case, including\nthe Herald, have agreed to redact the\nnames of minors and other details that\nwould identify victims.\n\nMaxwell is the sole party fighting to\nkeep the ertire record sealed. Two other\ncurrently unidentified people, labeling\nthemselves as John Does, have filed\nlegal briefs in an attempt to conceal\npersonal information that could con-\nnect them to the alleged underage sex\ntrafficking operation.\n\nEpstein, who was not party to the\nMaxwell suit, has denied that he ran\na sex trafficking operation, and his at-\ntomeys say that the number of victims\ninvolved has been “vastly exaggerated”\nby the media.\n\nIn addition to Florida and N.Y., Ep-\nstein lives on Little St. James Island off\nSt. Thomas.\n\nDO YOU NEED A\nPROFESSIONAL\nHEADSHOT\nPICTURE FOR\nWORK, TRAVEL,\nOR DRIVING?\n\nHUGHES PHOTO\nSunny Isle Shopping Center, St, Croix « (340) 778-6827\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_030094\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

Rather, they said, Clinton sounded curious about Trump's moves \ntoward a presidential bid and told Trump that he was striking a chord with \nfrustrated conservatives and was a rising force on the right.\" \nHillary Clinton, Bill's wife, is the front-runner for the Democratic nomination for \npresident in 2016. \nThe Clintons have long had ties with the real-estate magnate. As The Post notes, \nHillary Clinton attended Trump's wedding in 2005, and the reality-television \npersonality donated money to her past Senate campaigns, though he has also \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 030015 \ndonated to several of his own Republican presidential rivals. He has said \nthose donations were transactional. \nThe former president has spoken positively of Trump in the past. \nIn a 2012 interview with CNN, Clinton said he liked Trump, despite the real-estate \nmogul's controversial campaign to get President Barack Obama to release his birth \ncertificate. \n\"Donald Trump has been uncommonly nice to Hillary and me. We're all New \nYorkers,\" Clinton said. \"I like him. And I love playing golf with him.\" \nAides to both Bill Clinton and Trump did not comment on record to The Post. \nHillary Clinton's campaign also didn't respond to a request for comment. \nBill Clinton has occasionally doled out advice to Republican presidential candidates. \nIn 2012, Clinton reportedly gave former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney (R) some \ntips before his successful debate with President Barack Obama, telling the governor \nhow to appear in command onstage. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 030016 \n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

This is wonderful. If this \ncomes to pass, the best way for that money to come, I think, is as a gift to Poetry in America, an initiative at \nEdLabs at Harvard University. This will give me discretion over its disbursement to HarvardX and WGBH, but \nthis will be absolutely be a Harvard gift that will count as Campaign success and from which Harvard will take \nsome (but not as much)overhead. . So far the best finance people I've met are at EdLabs and they are happy to \nmanage these funds for me. There are other ways to give me this money that leave Harvard out, but my \nunderstanding is that your friend would like this to be a Harvard gift. \nHere's a draft of what I'd like to do with that money. \nI'd like 500,000 to do post-production and distribution of a whole historical period of American poetry (1914-\n1945 is what I'm thinking—Modernism) and including three episodes of tv. \nThe raw materials for that period include interviews with Bill Clinton (including footage not yet used by \nWGBH), Peter Gallison, Walter Isaacson, Lena Dunham, Woody Allen (whose lawyers didn't like our release a \nwhile ago, but we're hoping will soften over time), Harrison Ford (still a maybe), Robert Polito, Sarah Kay, Al \nFilreis, Rafael Campo, Susan Howe, kids from Nantucket High School, kids from Brookline High \nSchool, Alfre Woodard, Jane Pickering, Jay Parini, Ray Dalio, Leon Wieseltier, Richard Dawkins and others; \nand footage shot in Harlem, Greenwich Village, midtown, Chicago, London (if I have the money to hire a crew \nthere; don't now ), at museums including the Fogg, Harvard Museum of Natural History, Frost's house in Ripton \nVermont and more. \nThis allows the donor to give to a big Harvard Campaign priority, Teaching and Learning , by supporting Poetry \nin America, allowing me to produce the crucial segment of the online course with the highest (TV quality) \nproduction values and so also supplying higher quality video to WGBH as a way also to cut their costs. \nCurrently, HarvardX skimps (on lighting, for instance--see the Bill Clinton interview) and while WGBH ladles \nmoney raised by others into everything. I have been pounding away at my friends at WGBH and I know that \nWGBH producer will work with HarvardX if they can give him footage of the right quality. . That is, we'll use \nHarvardX as the backlot for WGBH so as to squeeze three episodes out for 250. \nThis proposal does not include experiments in schools or the curricular development into courses for teachers \nthat you've seen in other (million dollar ) proposals. But the courses for teachers can't happen before the \nfootage is developed, and these courses will have as their centerpiece the WGBH episodes, and so this funding \nwill make all the rest possible. \nI can polish this narrative and or edit it, if there are things you think I have wrong. \nAnd I can attach a draft budget based on real Harvard numbers (what my Harvard video editor, producer, media \nmanager cost) as well as a draft WGBH budget I'll now go an negotiate with them. Or we can do that at a \nsecond stage. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 028882 \nLet me know what you think? And when are we reading Whitman together.

All the different approaches\nto flight exploit the same core principles of aerodynamics in different ways; and similarly, the\nvarious different approaches to AGI will exploit the same core principles of general intelligence\nin different ways.\n\nIn the chapters leading up to this one, we have taken a fairly broad view of the project\nof engineering AGI. We have presented a conception and formal model of intelligence, and\ndescribed environments, teaching methodologies and cognitive and developmental pathways\nthat we believe are collectively appropriate for the creation of AGI at the human level and\nultimately beyond, and with a roughly human-like bias to its intelligence. These ideas stand\nalone and may be compatible with a variety of approaches to engineering AGI systems. However,\nthey also set the stage for the presentation of CogPrime, the particular AGI design on which\nwe are currently working.\n\nThe thorough presentation of the CogPrime design is the job of Part 2 of this book — where,\nnot only are the algorithms and structures involved in CogPrime reviewed in more detailed,\nbut their relationship to the theoretical ideas underlying CogPrime is pursued more deeply.\nThe job of this chapter is a smaller one: to give a high-level overview of some key aspects the\nCogPrime architecture at a mostly nontechnical level, so as to enable you to approach Part\n2 with a little more idea of what to expect. The remainder of Part 1, following this chapter,\nwill present various theoretical notions enabling the particulars, intent and consequences of the\nCogPrime design to be more thoroughly understood.\n\n6.2 High-Level Architecture of CogPrime\n\nFigures 6.1, 6.2 , 6.4 and 6.5 depict the high-level architecture of CogPrime, which involves\nthe use of multiple cognitive processes associated with multiple types of memory to enable\nan intelligent agent to execute the procedures that it believes have the best probability of\nworking toward its goals in its current context.

Third, Mr. Epstein would not\nknow who would be providing a massage at any particular time. Fourth, and importantly, Mr.\nEpstein’s assistants were not directed to contact underage women, and were not aware of the true\nages of the women they contacted. In fact, more often than not, the masseuses themselves, or the\nindividuals who introduced the masseuses, made the initial contact. As a result, Mr. Epstein and his\nassistants were routinely unaware of the identities of many of these young women before they\narrived.\n\nThe allegations further include the assertion that Mr. Epstein engaged in unlawful sexual\nconduct with certain underage women who arrived at his house to provide a massage. At times,\nduring these massages, Mr. Epstein masturbated, engaged in some sexual touching, and a small\nnumber of alleged acts of penetration. However, most of the women who performed massages on\nMr. Epstein were over the age of 18. Many of the young women have sworn under oath that they, in\nfact, told Mr. Epstein that they were 18 or older, and that they did so because they knew that if they\nwere not 18 years old, they would not be allowed into Mr. Epstein’s home. In fact, Mr. Epstein has\npassed a polygraph examination to this effect relative to the government’s primary, and youngest,\nalleged victim, Indeed, many of the women also worked at local massage parlors,\nwhich presumably had a requirement that the masseuse have reached the age of majority. To the\nextent there are allegations that Mr. Epstein should have been alerted to certain underage women\nbased on conversations he allegedly had with them, those conversations would have taken place in\nperson and at his home, thereby precluding any prior scheduling with knowledge of their true ages.\nAs explained below, any factual allegations of repeat massages with such persons would lack\nnecessary elements required for a federal nexus to such conduct.\n\nAll of the alleged activity occurred in Mr. Epstein’s home in Palm Beach, Florida. Many of\nthe massages allegedly involved conduct which, even if engaged in, is not proscribed by federal law,\neither because the masseuses were of age, or because conduct with underage masseuses only\ninvolved topless massages, massages in undergarments or naked massages. To the extent prohibited\nsexual activity occurred, any inducement, enticement, and/or persuasion used would have taken\nplace during a face-to-face encounter—thus eliminating the possibility for the commission of a\nfederal crime, which requires the existence of a communication through a facility of interstate\ncommerce in which the defendant persuades or entices the minor to engage in illegal sexual activity.\nFurthermore, any prohibited sexual activity that did occur based on the facts on the record is best left\nto the state to address because the facts of this case do not fall comfortably within the federal\ndomain.\n\nThis is a case about purely local activity, involving local actors, and affecting local\ninterests and thus, should be handled by local authorities.

Humans might be seen as minor\nannoyances, like ants at a picnic, but hybrid superintelligences—like corporations,\norganized religions, and nation states—could be existential threats. Like hybrid\nsuperintelligences, Als might see humans mostly as useful tools to accomplish their\ngoals, as pawns in their competition with the other superintelligences. Or we might\nsimply be irrelevant. It is not impossible that a machine intelligence has already emerged\nand we simply do not recognize it as such. It may not wish to be noticed, or it may be so\nalien to us that we are incapable of perceiving it. This makes the self-interested AI\nscenario the most difficult to imagine. I believe the easy-to-imagine versions, like the\nhumanoid intelligent robots of science fiction, are the least likely. Our most complex\nmachines, like the Internet, have already grown beyond the detailed understanding of a\nsingle human, and their emergent behaviors may be well beyond our ken.\n\nThe final scenario is that machine intelligences will not be allied with one another\nbut instead will work to further the goals of humanity as a whole. In this optimistic\nscenario, AI could help us restore the balance of power between the individual and the\ncorporation, between the citizen and the state. It could help us solve the problems that\nhave been created by hybrid superintelligences that subvert the goals of humans. In this\nscenario, AIs will empower us by giving us access to processing capacity and knowledge\ncurrently available only to corporations and states. In effect, they could become\nextensions of our own individual intelligences, in furtherance of our human goals. They\ncould make our weak individual intelligences strong. This prospect is both exciting and\nplausible. It is plausible because we have some choice in what we build, and we have a\nhistory of using technology to expand and augment our human capacities. As airplanes\nhave given us wings and engines have given us muscles to move mountains, so our\nnetwork of computers may amplify and extend our minds. We may not fully understand\nor control our destiny, but we have a chance to bend it in the direction of our values. The\nfuture is not something that will happen to us; it is something that we will build.\n\nWhy Wiener Saw What Others Missed\n\nThere is in electrical engineering a split which 1s known in Germany as the split between\nthe technique of strong currents and the technique of weak currents, and which we know\nas the distinction between power and communication engineering. It is this split which\nseparates the age just past from that in which we are now living.\n—Norbert Wiener, Cybernetics, or Control and\nCommunication in the Animal and the Machine\n\nCybernetics is the study of the how the weak can control the strong. Consider the\ndefining metaphor of the field: the helmsman guiding a ship with a tiller. The\nhelmsman’s goal is to control the heading of the ship, to keep it on the right course. The\ninformation, the message that is sent to the helmsman, comes from the compass or the\nstars, and the helmsman closes the feedback loop by sending the steering messages\nthrough the gentle force of his hand on the tiller. In this picture, we see the ship tossing\nin powerful wind and waves in the real world, controlled by the communication system\nof messages in the world of information.\n\nYet the distinction between “real” and “information” is mostly a difference in\nperspective.

In\naddition, the tech giant took a $900 million charge related to having to cut the price of its Surface RT tablet, which had — as\nyou might imagine — an impact on results. Missed profit expectations, missed revenue, missed all over the ying-yang.”\n\nWith the prospect that the next quarter could be weaker still and with numerous reports of late that there has been slowing of\nadoption from its new flagship Windows 8 offering, Ballmer and the board finally aligned to move his departure date sooner.\n\nMost critical to that decision, source said, were increased board worries that recent pressure from activist investor ValueAct\n— which has a large stake in the company — had a good chance of succeeding in its efforts to obtain a seat on the board of\nMicrosoft, especially if Ballmer stayed in place.\n\nAnd even if the software giant was able to thwart that from happening, said several sources, such a public fight is untenable\nfor the company, since it was likely to attract even more scrutiny to Ballmer’s performance and perhaps even more investor\naction.\n\nValueAct has until August 30 to notify Microsoft if it plans a proxy battle, and sources said it still wants more that Ballmer’s\nretirement. In talks, said sources, it has asked for an aggressive stock buyback and also a dividend increase, which might\nassuage its efforts to garner a board seat.\n\nBallmer denied any pressure from ValueAct specifically in his decision in an interview with the Seattle Times, though\nsources said that was simply bluster.\n\nAnd, even with mounting pressure on him, Ballmer definitely portrayed the change as his decision in an interview he gave to\nZDNet’s Mary Jo Foley last week, after his retirement announcement.\n\n“| would say for me, yeah, I’ve thought about it for a long time, but the timing became more clear to me over the course of the\nlast few months,” he insisted.\n\nWhen asked if Gates asked him to stay or go, he said no, apparently to both. “Bill respects my decision. | mean, it’s one of\nthese things when if it’s — you know, ultimately these kinds of things have to be one’s own personal decision.”\n\nThat statement also struck many inside the company as a quick shift. Ballmer, said sources, had been jumping\nenthusiastically into business review meetings, as part of the new structure, over the last month. In addition, he had\nexpressed to many employees his excitement at being part of the changes he had initiated.\n\nBut, in meetings after the announcement, numerous sources inside the company said Ballmer seemed uncharacteristically\nchastened and quiet, in contrast to his usual confident and forceful manner.\n\n“He was definitely not leaving and then he suddenly was,” said one source. “Even if today’s Steve made the choice, itwas a\nchoice yesterday’s Steve did not want to.”\n\nAnother source, close to the board, perhaps explained it best: “If ValueAct got on the board, | think Ballmer finally realized\nthat meant it was going to be the hard way from then on out until he left and he did not want that for a company he clearly\nloves and has been his life.”\n\nNow, those inside the company are turning to what comes next. While not everyone on the board thought that Ballmer\nshould step down without a new CEO in place, it’s moot now as Microsoft turbocharges the process — in place for several\nyears now — to select its next leader.\n\nBut, though the committee is headed up by John Thompson, CEO of Virtual Instruments and the former CEO of security\nsoftware giant Symantec, most expect Gates — as usual — to be the key decision maker on that choice, too.\n\nA Microsoft spokesman declined comment.\n\nBack to top\n\nThe Decline of E-Empires\nPaul Krugman — New York Times\n\nSteve Ballmer’s surprise announcement that he will be resigning as Microsoft's C.E.O. has set off a huge flood of\ncommentary. Being neither a tech geek nor a management guru, | can’t add much on those fronts. | do, however, think |\nknow a bit about economics, and | also read a lot of history. So the Ballmer announcement has me thinking about network\nexternalities and Ibn Khaldun. And thinking about these things, I’d argue, can help ensure that we draw the right lessons\nfrom this particular corporate upheaval.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_028630\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

However, it was\nquickly discovered that if audible feedback was provided — as if the Al device was a consultant working\nwith the healthcare provider and the patient — the consultations were more efficient; patient\nsatisfaction levels were higher; and outcomes were more positive.\n\nA large segment of health insurance sector sees early wins in supporting the technology, through the\nability to decrease insurance claims through efficient and preventative interventions, while maintaining\nhigh premiums. As such, they push for early and widespread adoption of the technology. This is further\nsupported by the Department of Health and Human Services as it hits a number of goals, including\nincreasing health and well-being while reducing healthcare costs.\n\nWith the success of early implementations, new Al-based technologies are rapidly implemented into\nsubsequent generations of Al-consult. However, the commercial sector developing and using Al-\nconsult has shifted dramatically from the technology’s initial beginnings.\n\nAs the technology began to mature and lead to substantial savings in healthcare costs traditional\nhealthcare providers and health insurance companies begin to suffer. They resist the use of Al-consult\nthrough a combination of lobbying for new policies and regulations limiting use, to marketing\ncampaigns persuading people of the critical importance of human interaction in healthcare. They forge\nlinks with a number of advocacy groups opposed to widespread automation in society, and promote\nthe idea of Al-consult undermining human dignity and jobs creation. However, the health benefits and\ncost savings of Al-consult are so compelling that these campaigns gain little traction. As a result,\ncompanies that can not adapt, loose market share, and in some cases collapse.\n\nIn contrast, a number of healthcare companies, and a growing number of tech companies, take\nadvantage of the rapidly changing healthcare environment to promote preventative care using Al-\nconsult, and to take advantage of cost-effective healthcare approaches that lead to demonstrably\nbetter outcomes than non Al-consult based approaches. As a result, by 2030, the healthcare provider\nand insurance sector has undergone a disruptive transformation. What is especially notable is the\nnumber of technology companies expanding into the healthcare business, and either partnering with\nwell-established healthcare providers, or forcing them out of the market. This shift in key players leads\nto a marked change in approaches and attitudes toward healthcare provision.\n\nBy 2030 Al-consult systems have the ability to monitor their environment visually as well as audibly,\naccurately picking up on and interpreting body language and micro-expressions. They have access to\nrapidly growing databases of genetic profiles; proteome, microbiome and other ohmic profiles;\npurchasing, eating and lifestyle habits; medical, insurance, financial and legal histories; social media;\nand location, movement, and other dynamic activity/physiology histories (through the growing use of\ncloud-based quantified self services).

He proposed we meet at the Foreign Correspondent’s Club on\ntop of Ice House Street in central Hong Kong, a venue, I recalled, reminiscent of where John\nLeCarre had set the opening chapter of his spy novel The Honourable Schoolboy. When we spoke\nlater, Bradsher told me that he knew Albert Ho, who had been retained as Snowden’s lawyer, for more\nthan a decade, and interviewed him many times as he was a leader of a political movement in\nHong Kong. Bradsher said that a few days after Snowden had revealed himself on June 9\", 2013,\nhe met with Ho and questioned him on the very question that intrigued me about Snowden’s\nunknown whereabouts. Ho told Bradsher that all of Snowden’s logistics had been arranged for\nhim by an intermediary, who Ho called a “carer.” Ho further said that Snowden had been in\ncontact with the “carer” prior to his arrival in Hong Kong on May 20th. According to Ho, it was\nthis person who had arranged accommodations for Snowden on his arrival—and afterwards. If\nso, It seemed plausible to me that this person might be able to shed light on whom, if anyone,\nSnowden saw in his first ii days in Hong Kong. Of course, this person may have been unaware of\nthe reasons for Snowden’s escape to Hong Kong when he made the arrangements for him but he\nwas the best lead I had to learning why Snowden had come to Hong Kong. But who was the\n“carer?” Bradsher told me that he pressed Ho for details about this mystery person over the\ncourse of several meeting but Ho would not identify him beyond saying, that he was a “well-\nconnected “resident” of Hong Kong.\n\nI next called Ho’s law office in Hong Kong. But Ho politely declined to be interviewed by me,\nsaying he had said all he was going to say about the Snowden case. I next made an appointment\nwith Robert Tibbo, a Canadian-born barrister, specializing in civil liberties cases, who had worked\nclosely with Ho on the Snowden case. He immediately agreed to see me.\n\nI met Tibbo in the tea room at the Mandarin Oriental hotel on Hong Kong Island, where I\nmoved to from the Mira hotel. The Mandarin was also convenient to Tibbo’s office at the court.\n\nTibbo was a tall, round-faced man, with thinning hair, in his early fifties. He talked freely\nabout his remarkable career. After earning a degree in chemical engineering from McGill\nUniversity, and working in Asia as an engineer for a decade, he went to law school in New\nZealand, and then became a barrister in Hong Kong specializing in cases involving the legal status\nof refugees. Over a leisurely tea, Tibbo made it clear to me that he had played a far more active\nrole than Ho in the Snowden case, even personally escorting Snowden from the Mira Hotel on\nJune 10\" to a safe house.

These materials include short form videos such as this one on\n\nRobert Pinsky’s “Shirt” (as featured in The New Yorker), and, this spring, the sixth module of the\nfree seven-part Poetry in America MOOC, which has registrants in over 150 countries.\n\nGrowing rapidly, and outpacing our current staff and infrastructure, Poetry in America has a\nfundraising goal this year of 2.5 million dollars to fund its expanding group of projects. We’ve\ntaken a big step, hiring the design agency Threespot to help us develop our web presence. Our\nwebsite— to launch early 2016— will eventually serve as an online hub for our TV show and\neducational projects. We hope you'll join us then for a virtual launch!\n\nFinally, Jeffrey, you have been such a wonderful supporter of my Poetry in America project. The\nLeon Black gift changed everything for me last year. It paid salaries for staff | desperately needed\nto complete projects (detail below), but first and foremost, it gave me leverage, enabling me to set\ndown a Solid Harvard base for my activities by giving the school something to point to: this public\nhumanities project among the list of projects the Dean supports. The money did it: as soon as\nthey heard about the gift, they took my project more seriously. Because of that gift, the Faculty of\nArts and Sciences, which is space-stingy, found and rewired a studio space for me to house my\nvideo production operation and team. That gift woke up the Deans to the importance of Harvard's\nrole in producing the highest quality humanities content for the WORLD, and not just for Harvard\nstudents. My main employee has half of her salary paid with these funds, and the foundation of\nour collection for PBS LearningMedia is being made with this support. This gift represented one of\nthe most consequential shifts of the last year, allowing me create content and launch projects this\nyear that make future projects that much more likely. If | can keep this base sturdy at Harvard,\nrefilling these coffers, | will be that much more able to keep working.\n\n| am also so grateful for the help you gave me in defining my project for Templeton, and, what\nhelp you have offered to give in bringing them around. | have, since Templeton turned me down,\ngotten funding to produce video on two of the poems I'd proposed to Templeton and to create,\nand test, that video in schools as | proposed. One of my partners in that project is Success\nAcademy, where | could also expand my work with Templeton. And there are still other poems\nthat may satisfy their character criteria more fully, including the third of the poems Id originally\nproposed and that Joe Biden had agreed to discuss with me (on parenthood and humility). At this\npoint, I’m gaining the platform and the name recognition to be an effective spokesperson for the\nfoundation on building literacy and character in the schools.\n\nIt really means a lot to me, ail financial help aside, Jeffrey, that you are rooting for me and thinking\nabout me. You push back a lot (as Larry does), and it’s always annoying but | always learn.\n\nWith abundant gratitude,\nLisa\n\nElisa New\n\nPowell M.

The Yeshivas I went\nto as a kid were very patriotic. We recited the pledge at assemblies, and some teachers made us\nsay it every day in class.\n\nMost kids hate change, so when the two words were added, there was some grumbling, not\nbecause of the content of the words, but just because it was different from the way we always had\ndone it.\n\nI remember thinking about the meaning of the two new words. Under which God? Under whose\nGod? Is there only one God that all American can pledge allegiance to or are there different gods\nthat different religions worship? What about the Trinity? Is Jesus God? And what is that thing\nthe Catholic kids call “the Holy Ghost?” Scary! But is it God too? Are Jews even supposed to\nsay the word God (we were always taught to spell it, G-d)? Is Allah the same god as Elohim?\nWhat about Jehovah—the name we were absolutely prohibited from pronouncing?\n\nThese were precisely the sort of theological questions we were not supposed to be thinking about.\nWe were supposed to do and not do—go to shul, don’t eat shrimp—and to ask our Rabbi what to\nthink about such esoteric issues. They know the religiously correct answer. Yet the addition of\nthe two words to the pledge forced me not only to think about them but to try to place them in\nthe context of my own role as a young Orthodox Jewish skeptic in a largely Christian America.\nOur school taught us that even though America was a majority Christian country, George\nWashington, in his famous letter to the congregants of the Truro Synagogue in Newport, had\nassured Jewish Americans that in this New Republic “It is now no more that toleration is spoken\nof, as if it was by the indulgence of one class of people that another enjoyed the exercise of their\ninherent natural rights.” Here, all Americans “possess alike liberty of conscience and immunity of\ncitizenship” because our government “gives to bigotry no sanction [and] to persecution no\nassistance.”\n\nThese powerful words written by the father of our country were displayed on the bulletin board of\nour Yeshiva as if they constituted the Magna Carta for American Jews.*\n\nYet we saw bigotry all around us. We knew that no Jew had ever been elected president. No\nJew had ever been the head of a major corporation or university. We knew that there were\nquotas limiting the number of Jews at most Ivy League colleges. Still, we believed that this was a\nland of opportunity and that we could do anything, within certain limits, and that even these limits\nwere narrowing, though not yet disappearing.\n\n°° Most of the words were borrowed by Washington from the letter written to him by the Rabbi of the Truro\nSynagogue.\n\n300\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_017387\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

Although the schools must meet Regent exam requirements the same as other public schools, they are given more autonomy and freedom when it comes to planning their curricula. \n\n\n\nWhat also sets the Bard Schools apart, is that the students graduate not only with a high school diploma, but also with 60 college credits and an associates degree in the liberal arts and sciences from Bard College. \n\n\n\nAdmission to Bard High the Sschool is based on a student's writing ability and grades. It's a competitive program and fewer than 10 percent of students who apply are accepted each year.\n\n\n\nIn 2012, Epstein also provided substantial funding to the Maya Angelou charter schools in Washington, DC. The charter schools were started in 1997 for teenagers who were in the juvenile justice system. Since then, the charter schools have grown and now include four schools, including a program for older students. Currently, over 600 students attend the four schools. The graduation and college acceptance rate for the Maya Angelou Charter schools is considerably higher than for regular schools in the DC area.\n\n\n\nJeffrey Epstein notes that 73 percent of the school's graduates attend college and 60 percent go on to earn a college degree. The Jeffrey Epstein VI Foundation is proud to have been able to support such a worthy school. \n\n\n\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

I believe the latter is the case.\n\nThe original theory behind the metaphor of “the wall of separation” was to protect the holiness of\nthe church from the corrupting influences of the secular state. Roger Williams, who is credited\nwith coining the metaphor, was a 17\" Century Baptist minister in Providence, Rhode Island. He\ninsisted that a “hedge or wall of separation between the garden of the church and the wilderness\nof the world” was necessary to protect religion, as well as to assure freedom of conscience. And\nthis wall has worked wonderfully to do both.”\n\nChurches are thriving in America, unlike in most European countries that have long traditions of\nestablished churches. When the state supports churches, resentment against government, which is\ninevitable, spills over to religion. Consider Israel, whose citizens are far more secular on average\nthan Americans. Many Israeli Jews resent religion because the Rabbis have too much influence\nover marriage, divorce and other aspects of daily life. This turns people against religion. Israel\ndoes not have an established religion, despite its being a “Jewish state.” Muslim and Christian\nIsraelis, who comprise nearly a quarter of the population, have equal status and equal rights, or at\nleast as a matter of law, but Conservative and Reform Jews do not. Within the Jewish religion,\nOrthodoxy is the established branch. This has caused enormous resentment—against both the\nstate and the synagogue—by reform, conservative and secular Jews and have driven many of them\naway from religion. In the U.S., on the other hand, resentment against the government\n(Congress’ approval rating is always quite low) does not translate into resentment against the\nchurches. To the contrary, cynicism about politics, may well drive some people toward greater\ncommitment to their churches.\n\nI believe, therefore, that perhaps the single most important guarantee in our Constitution is one\nthat is not explicitly enumerated: the separation of church and state. Although those words do\nnot appear in either the body of the Constitution or in the First Amendment, there can be no\ndoubt that the founding fathers constructed a system of checks and balances that required such\nseparation. Without it, the church (representing organized religion) could not serve as an\neffective check on the secular excesses of the state; nor could the state serve as an effective check\non the excessive involvement of the church in the business of governance and on the rights of\nreligious and non-religious dissenters. The marvel of our unique system of checks and balances, is\nthat is does not simply involve each branch of government—executive, legislative and\njudicial—checking on the others; it also encourages—through the freedoms guaranteed by the\nFirst Amendment—other institutions to serve as checks on the government. In addition to the\nchurches (broadly defined to include all religious institutions), these include the media, the\nacademy, the business community, and especially the “people” who have the right to vote, to\nassemble and to petition for a redress of grievances.\n\nJust before the 50\" Anniversary of the Declaration of Independence—the day on which two of its\nprimary authors, Jefferson and Adams, both died—Jefferson wrote the following about the\npurpose of Declaration:\n\n*! The irony is that the wall was essentially a contribution made by Baptists to America, is now being attacked by\nmany Baptists.\n\n306\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_017393\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

It was perception, not reality.\n\nRobin Malinsky-Rummell, who spent a year traveling through South America with her husband and\nseven-year-old son, was warned by friends and family not to visit Argentina after their devaluation riots\nin 2001.

I would never go to such a dangerous place!”\nDon’t assume that places abroad are more dangerous than your hometown. Most aren’t.\n\nRobin is convinced, as are other NR parents, that people use children as an excuse to stay in their\ncomfort zones. It’s an easy excuse not to do something adventurous. How to overcome the fear? Robin\nrecommends two things:\n\n1. Before embarking on a long international trip with your children for the first time, take a trial run\nfor a few weeks.\n\n2. For each stop, arrange a week of language classes that begin upon arrival and take advantage of\ntransportation from the airport if available.

The documents he provided\nthe journalists showed that the NSA had been obtaining phone records every three months that\nhad been collected by Verizon. While this revelation may have shocked the American public, the\nNSA had not acted on its own. It had obtained a warrant issued by a secret court established by\nCongress in 1978 as part of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) for each request for\nrecords. Congress empowered the FISA court to hear cases and authorize search warrants in\nsecret in cases involving national security. As its name implies, the FISA court was meant to deal\nwith matters bearing on foreign intelligence activities in the United States. That restriction\nchanged after the devastating terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. A month after the attack,\nCongress expanded the purview of the FISA court by passing the USA Patriot Act (an acronym\nwhich stands for “Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required\nto Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism”). Part of the Act, Section 215, euphemistically referred to\nas the \"library records\" provision, permitted the FISA court to issue warrants authorizing searches\nof records by the NSA and other federal agencies to investigate international terrorism or\nclandestine intelligence activities Through these FISA authorizations, the NSA could obtain\n\"tangible things\" such as \"books, records, papers, documents, and other items.\" Under the\ninterpretation of this section of the law by both the Bush and Obama administrations, the FISA\ncourt was enabled by Congress to issue warrants to telephone companies demanding that they\nturn over to the NSA the bulk billing records of all calls made in America.. The FISA court need\nonly deem these records to be “relevant: to the FBI’s investigations of terrorists and spies.\nEssentially, this controversial interpretation of the word “relevant” in Section 215 by the FISA\ncourt was used by the NSA to create a searchable database of telephone billing records. Sucha\n“haystack,” as the NSA called the national collection of billing records, could allow the FBI to\ninstantly find missing “needles,” even if the connections were made years earlier. For example, if\nthe FBI had a lead on a foreign suspect, it could search the data base for any telephone calls made\nby the foreign suspect to telephone numbers in America, and then who those people called. The\nFBI always had this power, if it obtained a warrant, but it did not have the records previously in a\nsingle data base. General Alexander believed such a “Haystack” database made sense. His\napproach was, ‘Let’s collect the whole haystack,’” according to one former senior U.S.\nintelligence official quoted by the Washington Post. According to its critics, including the\nACLU, the results provided by this vast database did not justify its immense potential for abuse.\nIn early May 2015, just three weeks before this part of the Patriot Act was set to expire, a three-\njudge panel of the Second U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New York, agreed with the ACLU\nposition, overturning a lower court decision that it was legal. The panel found that the word\n“relevant” in the Act was not intended by Congress to justify the acquisition and storing of the\nbulk records of telephone companies. It declared that the government’s interpretation of Section\n215 of The Patriot Act was incorrect. Soon afterwards Congress replaced the Patriot Act with\nthe USA Freedom Act, which effectively transferred bulk storage of billing records from the NSA\nto the phone companies themselves. Despite the change in venue, the records of individuals were\nstill not completely private. The databases held by phone companies could still be searched under\nthe new law via a FISA warrant by the FBI.\n\nThe core of Snowden’s charge in the media was that the FISA court overreached its authority\nby issuing sweeping warrants that allowed the NSA to obtain data collected by private phone and\nInternet companies.

This would be a moment of truth not just for\nme. Or for Bill Clinton, a man who understood our conflict more deeply, and\nwas more determined to help us end it, than any other president before him. It\nwas a moment of truth for the leader of the Palestinians, Yasir Arafat.\n\nThe Oslo Accords of 1993, groundbreaking though they were, had created a\npeace process, not peace. Over the past few years, that process had been\nlurching from crisis to crisis. Political support for negotiations was fraying. And\nyet the core issues of our conflict had not been resolved. In fact, they had hardly\nbeen talked about. The reason for this was no secret. For both sides, these\nquestions lay at the heart of everything we’d been saying for years, to the world\nand to ourselves, about the roots of the conflict and the minimum terms we\ncould accept in order to end it. At issue were rival claims on security, final\nborders, Israeli settlements, Palestinian refugees, and the future of ancient city\nof Jerusalem. None of these could be resolved without painful, and politically\nperilous, compromises.\n\nEntering the summit, despite the pressures ahead, I was confident that I, with\nmy team of aides and negotiators, would do our part to make such a final peace\nagreement possible. Nor did I doubt that President Clinton, whom I had come to\nview not just as a diplomatic partner but a friend, would rise to the occasion.\n\nBut as for Arafat? There was simply no way of knowing.\n\nThat was why I had pressed President Clinton so hard to convene the\nsummit.

Elevated levels of radioactive cesium in surrounding waters seem to confirm those suspicions.\n\nTepco has said those leaks are not directly from beneath the reactors, but from maintenance tunnels that run along the coast\nand remain contaminated from the early days of the disaster.\n\nBut it also acknowledges that the water beneath the reactors is extremely contaminated, and experts say that if it does get\ninto the ocean, it will surpass even the leaks that occurred in the disaster’s early days.\n\n“That prospect scares me,” Michio Aoyama, a senior scientist in the Oceanography and Geochemistry Research\nDepartment at the government-affiliated Meteorological Research Institute, said in an interview this month.\n\n“It’s the ultimate, worst-case scenario,” Professor Aoyama said.\n\nBack to top\n\nThe New Nuclear Craze\nMark Bittman - New York Times\n\nThere is a new discussion about nuclear energy, prompted by well-founded concerns about carbon emissions and fueled by\na pro-nuclear documentary called “Pandora’s Promise.” Add a statement by James E. Hansen — who famously sounded\nthe alarm on climate change — and, of course, industry propaganda, and presto: We Love Nukes.\n\nBefore we all become pro-nuclear greens, however, you’ve got to ask three questions: Is nuclear power safe and clean? Is it\neconomical? And are there better alternatives?\n\nNo, noand yes. So let’s not swap the pending environmental disaster of climate change for another that may be equally\nrisky.\n\nDespite all-out efforts and international cooperation, Fukushima, which scared Germany right out of the nuclear power\nbusiness, still isn’t under control. Proponents of nuclear power promise new and safer technology, but these discussions\nare filled with “coulds”; no such plants exist. Nor would they reduce the risks of proliferation. (Oh, that little thing.)\n\nNor would they do much to mitigate the all-too-infrequently discussed dangers of uranium mining, which uses vast amounts\nof water in the West — an area that can ill afford it— and is barely regulated or even studied. Thousands of uranium mines\nhave been abandoned, and no one seems to know how many remain to be cleaned up. The cost of that cleanup, of course,\nwill be borne by taxpayers, not industry.\n\nThen there’s disposal of spent fuel, which is not contained at the same safety level as active fuel, itself a scary thought.\nDecades into the nuclear age there remains, incredibly, no real plan for this; a patchwork scheme by the Nuclear Regulatory\nCommission, which appears to be even more industry-friendly than most federal agencies, was rejected by an appeals court\nlast year, and the Obama administration is standing by its campaign promise (shocking, | know) to abandon the nuclear\nrepository at Yucca Mountain in Nevada.\n\nThe economic viability of nuclear power is no more encouraging. Plants continue to close and generation rates continue to\ndrop. Operators may indeed continue to make money on reactors, but that’s only because federal subsidies are enormous.\nInsurance costs are limited. Loans are guaranteed (the Solyndra loan guarantee was half a billion dollars; in contrast, loan\nguarantees for new nuclear plants may run $8 billion); cost recovery and return on investment are also assured for decades,\nand some operators are able to collect costs from ratepayers (and pay dividends to shareholders) years before plants come\nonline — even if they never come online.\n\nSo they’re economical as long as you’re the owner, because historically, subsidies for nuclear power have been more than\ndouble the expense of power generation itself. While estimates of the costs of power generation vary wildly — allowing both\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_028624\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

Finally, abuse of data is not limited to corporations: In\ntotalitarian states, or even nominally democratic ones, governments know things about\ntheir citizens that Orwell could not have imagined. The use they make of this\ninformation may not always be transparent or possible to counter.\n\nThe prospect of AI for military purposes is frightening. One can imagine\nintelligent systems being designed to act autonomously based on real-time data and able\nto act faster than the enemy, starting catastrophic wars. Such wars may not necessarily\nbe conventional or even nuclear wars. Given how essential computer networks are to\nmodern society, it is much more likely that AI wars will be fought in cyberspace. The\nconsequences could be just as dire.\n\nDespite this loss of control, we continue to march inexorably into a world in which AI\nwill be everywhere: Individuals won’t be able to resist its convenience and power, and\ncorporations and governments won’t be able to resist its competitive advantages. But\nimportant questions arise about the future of work. Computers have been responsible for\nconsiderable losses in blue-collar jobs in the last few decades, but until recently many\nwhite-collar jobs—jobs that “only humans can do”—were thought to be safe. Suddenly\nthat no longer appears to be true. Accountants, many legal and medical professionals,\nfinancial analysts and stockbrokers, travel agents—in fact, a large fraction of white-collar\njobs—will disappear as a result of sophisticated machine-learning programs. We face a\nfuture in which factories churn out goods with very few employees and the movement of\ngoods is largely automated, as are many services. What’s left for humans to do?\n\nIn 1930—long before the advent of computers, let alone AI—John Maynard\nKeynes wrote, in an essay called “Economic Possibilities for our Grandchildren,” that as\na result of improvements in productivity, society could produce all its needs with a\nfifteen-hour work week. He also predicted, along with the growth of creative leisure, the\nend of money and wealth as a goal:\n\nWe shall be able to afford to dare to assess the money-motive at its true value.\nThe love of money as a possession—as distinguished from the love of money as\na means to the enjoyments and realities of life—will be recognised for what it is,\na somewhat disgusting morbidity, one of those semi-criminal, semi-pathological\npropensities which one hands over with a shudder to the specialists in mental\ndisease.\n\n130\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_016933\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

You have to study, pass exams, this,\nthat. And I put that aside, that experience side.\n\nThen at the age of 22, I came to the United States, and I had to do a lot of hardship to get\nhere. My father wanted me to follow in his footsteps and be an academic. He was a\nprofessor, too, of cardiology. So I worked hard. India wasn’t encouraging people to leave. I\nhad to go to Sri Lanka to pass my exams, I had to borrow money to get a flight to the United\nStates, I passed all that, I had to spend a year in New Jersey at a very ordinary community\nhospital, hard-working, and I got a residency in Boston with various hospitals with\nacademics. So, Harvard, Tufts, BU, internal medicine, hard work, no thinking about\nconsciousness whatsoever. Just passing one exam after another, getting one fellowship after\nanother.\n\nAnd then I came here in 1970, July 1, basically as an intern in a hospital that no longer exists\nin New Jersey, MuhlenbergHospital, but then in the next year I got into all these academic\ninstitutions in Boston and went from one to another. I trained in internal medicine. And then\nI had heard vaguely of a discipline called neuroendocrinology, and I had also heard vaguely\nof this new revolution in medicine at that time, which was looking at peptides in the\ncirculation. And the peptide that was very popular at that time was something called opiates,\nwhich are now popular again, and the opioid receptor, with somebody called George\nSolomon in Washington, who was an expert in that, but I discovered that the number one\nguy in the world in neuroendocrinology at that time was a professor at Tufts New England\nMedical Center, and his name was Seymour Reichlin and he was a legend. Okay, so, if you\nfound a snake in his garden he would dissect it and look at the hypothalamus and identify\nreceptors for opioids, serotonin, this and that. P’Il show you his photo recently. I just met him\nthe other day at the consciousness conference, which is bizarre because I hadn’t met him in\nall these years. He’s 94, and he was giving a lecture on serotonin and mystical experiences,\nat the age of 94, and he came to my lecture, and he was one of the most amazing guys in the\nworld, actually. It was a real joy to meet him. This is him, let me show you. Anyway I'll\nshow you his photo in a second. He’s 94, he gives talks on serotonin, but he was a legend.\n\nI got a fellowship with him, and through him I met somebody who is no longer alive,\nCandace Pert, who had actually discovered the opioid receptor, and she and I met at a\nconference. She later became the chief of brain chemistry at the NIH. And she told me these\nmolecules that we’re talking about, serotonin, opiates, oxytocin, dopamine they are the\nmolecules of emotion. So that’s the first time I’ve heard that expression. I said, \"You should\nwrite a book about it.\" She did. I wrote the foreword and it was for me one of the milestones\nof my life. And so I applied to Reichlin’s fellowship and I got it, and it was like the most\nprestigious thing you could get.\n\nBut then I had my own issues with medicine. Is this interesting to you?

Accordingly, the\nstatement will be modified to read\n“threaten or coerce you in order to gain\nyour support for the union.”’ Second,\nthe comment suggests changing “‘cause\nor attempt to cause an employer to\ndiscriminate against you” to\n“discriminate or attempt to discriminate\nagainst you because you don’t support\na union.” The Board disagrees, because\nthe suggested change would shift the\nfocus of the provision away from the\nsort of conduct contemplated in the\ntule. See NLRA Section 8(b)(2), 29\nU.S.C. 158(b)(2). Third, the comment\nsuggests changing “‘take other adverse\naction against you based on whether\nyou have joined or support the union”\nto “take adverse action against you\nbecause you have not joined or do not\nsupport the union.’ The Board agrees\nand will modify this provision of the\nnotice accordingly.\n\nBaker & McKenzie urges that a variety\nof other examples of unlawful union\nconduct be added to the notice,\nincluding requiring nonmembers to pay\na fee to receive contract benefits,\ndisciplining members for engaging in\nactivity adverse to a union-represented\ngrievant, disciplining members for\nrefusing to engage in unprotected\nactivity, engaging in careless grievance\nhandling, failing to notify employees of\ntheir Beck rights, requiring employees to\nagree to dues checkoff instead of direct\npayment, discriminatorily applying\nhiring hall rules, and conditioning\ncontinued employment on the payment\nof a fine or dues in “‘right-to-work’”’\nstates.\n\n109 See comment of National Association of\nManufacturers.\n110 See comment of ALFA.\n\nAs with the examples of unlawful\nemployer activity, the Board concludes\nthat the provisions concerning unlawful\nunion activity, as proposed, are accurate\nand informative, and, as with the notice\nas a whole, strike an appropriate\nbalance between being simultaneously\ninstructive and succinct. Moreover, the\nBoard finds it unnecessary to include\nadditional examples of unlawful\nconduct so that the lists of employer\nand union activity are the same length\nbecause the notice describes the central\nforms of unlawful conduct engaged in\nby each type of entity. Still less is it\nnecessary to add a host of additional\nexamples of unlawful union conduct,\nwith the result that the list of such\nconduct would be much longer than the\nlist of unlawful employer conduct. In\nthe Board’s view, the list of unlawful\nunion conduct in the proposed notice\nfairly informs employees of the types of\nconduct that a union is prohibited from\nengaging in without providing\nunnecessary or confusing examples.\nEmployees may contact the NLRB if\nthey believe a union has violated the\nNLRA.\n\ne. Collective-Bargaining Provision\n\nThe collective-bargaining provision of\nthe NPRM states that “if you and your\nco-workers select a union to act as your\ncollective bargaining representatives,\nyour employer and the union are\nrequired to bargain in good faith and in\na genuine effort to reach a written,\nbinding agreement setting your terms\nand conditions of employment. The\nunion is required to fairly represent you\nin bargaining and enforcing the\nagreement.” 75 FR 80419.\n\nThe Board received only a few\ncomments on this provision of the\nnotice. Notably, COLLE requests the\ninclusion of a limitation on the\nprovision that employees have the right\nto bargain collectively, in order to\nclarify that the employer’s obligation is\nonly to bargain in good faith and not\nnecessarily to reach an agreement. A\nsecond comment suggests that the\nnotice inform employees that they have\nthe right to “sue a union for unfairly\nrepresenting the employee in\nbargaining, contract administration, or a\ndiscrimination matter.”\n\nThe Board has decided that no\nchanges are necessary to the duty to\nbargain paragraph. The Board is\nsatisfied that the proposed collective-\nbargaining provision provides sufficient\nguidance to employees about the\nexercise of these rights while still\nstaying within the constraints set by a\nnecessarily brief employee notice. As to\nthe first comment, the notice states that\nan employer and union have a duty to\n\n“bargain in good faith and in a genuine\neffort to reach a written, binding\nagreement.” As discussed above, by\nreferring to a “genuine effort’ to reach\nagreement, the notice necessarily\nimplies that the parties are not obliged\nto actually reach one. The duty to\nbargain in good faith has many\ncomponents. See NLRB v. Katz, 369 U.S.\n736 (1962). And the suggestion that\nemployers do not have to agree to\ncertain proposals, although correct, does\nnot account for the line of cases that\nsuggest that an important ingredient in\ngood faith bargaining is a willingness to\ncompromise. See Phelps Dodge, 337\nNLRB 455 (2002).\n\nTurning to the suggestion that the\nnotice include language informing\nemployees of their right to “sue” the\nunion if it fails to represent them fairly,\nthe Board has concluded that the notice\nsufficiently apprises employees of their\nright to fair representation and of their\nright to file unfair labor practice charges\nwith the Board should a union fail to\nfulfill that duty. The rights that\nemployees have to sue unions directly\nin court without coming to the Board\nare beyond the scope of this rulemaking.\n\nf. Coverage Provision\n\nIn regard to coverage under the NLRA,\nthe proposed notice states:\n\nThe National Labor Relations Act covers\nmost private-sector employers. Excluded\nfrom coverage under the NLRA are public-\nsector employees, agricultural and domestic\nworkers, independent contractors, workers\nemployed by a parent or spouse, employees\nof air and rail carriers covered by the Railway\nLabor Act, and supervisors (although\nsupervisors that have been discriminated\nagainst for refusing to violate the NLRA may\nbe covered). 75 FR 80419.\n\nA comment from the National\nImmigration Law Center suggests adding\nthe following language: ““The NLRA\nprotects the above-enumerated rights of\nall employees, irrespective of their\nimmigration status. That protection\nextends to employees without work\nauthorization, though certain remedies\nin those circumstances may be limited.\nEmployers cannot threaten you or\nintimidate you on the basis of you\nimmigration status to prevent you from\njoining or supporting a union, or\nengaging in concerted activity for\nmutual aid and protection.”\n\nThe Board has decided not to amend\nthe coverage provision in the final\nnotice. Although the Board understands\nthat many immigrant employees may be\nunsure whether they are covered by the\nNLRA, the notice does not include a list\nof covered employees. Including\nspecific coverage of immigrants, but not\nother classes of employees, may cause\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_022297\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

The most heinous of crimes, described on the CEOS website, fall within\nthis statute and include the buying and selling of children and the forced servitude of third-world\nimmigrants brought to this country to be enslaved. Mr. Epstein’s behavior is nowhere near the\nheartland of this statute. This statute has also been previously reserved for prostitution rings\ninvolving violence, drugs and force. In stark contrast, there is no jurisdictional hook that brings\nMr. Epstein’s conduct within the ambit of the statute, and securing a prosecution on these facts\nwould require a court to set aside both reason and precedent to convict a local ‘John’ with a sex-\nslavery crime. It can not be said that Mr. Epstein engaged in trafficking and slavery nor did he\nknowingly recruit or obtain underage women with knowledge that they would be caused to\nengage in a commercial sex act. Thus, prosecuting him under this statute would expand the law\nfar beyond its scope.\n\nTo the extent there are cases where prosecutors think that Mr. Epstein should have known\nthat certain women were underage, there is no evidence that Mr. Epstein “caused [them] to\nengage in a commercial sex act.” The term “cause” naturally implies the application of some\nsort of force, coercion, or undue pressure, but there is no evidence that Mr. Epstein’s interactions\nwith the women were anything but consensual. Again, many of the women phoned Mr.\nEpstein’s assistant themselves in order to determine whether he wanted a massage. Nor can the\ncause requirement be proved simply by the fact that Mr. Epstein compensated the women. After\nall, the statute elsewhere requires that the women “engage in a commercial sex act,” which by\ndefinition means that they would have received something of value in exchange for sexual\nservices. Interpreting the statute to authorize prosecution whenever a commercial sex act results\nfrom solicitation thus would render the term “caused” superfluous, and would make every ‘John’\nwho interacts with an underage prostitute guilty of a federal crime—even where the transaction\nis entirely local. Read in context, then, there is no doubt that the statute targets pimps and sex-\ntraffickers who knowingly obtain underage girls and direct them to engage in prostitution. There\nis not a shred of evidence that Mr. Epstein (or his assistants) did any such thing, and he cannot be\nprosecuted under this statute.\n\nThe Cuellar and Santos decisions also foreclose a prosecution under § 1591. Just as the\nfederal money laundering statute did not come down to a proscription against transportation of\ncriminal proceeds that are hidden, the sex trafficking of children statute cannot be boiled down\n\nand expanded to a federal proscription of commercial sexual activity with persons who turn out\nto be below the age of 18.\n\n3. 18 U.S.C. § 2423\n\n1]\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_012152\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

Such awareness is even more vital for\nChinese Americans who seek political office and whose abilities to navigate these\n\nshoals will depend on their knowledge of this complex system of interaction.\n\nAmerican Communities as Engines of Engagement\n\nThe American federal system allows sub-national governments considerable leeway\n\nto pursue local interests generally regardless of Washington’s security concerns. Free\nfrom geostrategic worries, state, county, and municipal leaders who have formed\ncommercial and people-to-people relationships with the PRC have been a bulwark\n\nof better US-China relations since the early 1970s, and their efforts to build mutual\nunderstanding and solve joint problems formed the bedrock of bilateral relations over\nfour decades. However, as China becomes more reliant on its old Leninist system and\n“united front” tactics (48% skBs), Sino-US relations become more contentious, and\n\nthe CCP seeks to more forcefully build influence in American communities through\nchannels detailed in this study, local leaders will be called upon to give greater\nweight to national interests when forming exchange relationships with PRC actors.\nConversely, as Beijing’s relations with Washington worsen, China will likely seek to\nuse tried-and-true “divide and conquer” tactics by cultivating new relations with more\n\nstate and local-level officials.\n\nSection 2\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_020480\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

It is his ‘machines’ we will look at next.\n\nPenrose-Hameroff Machines, aka Brains\n\nRoger Penrose of Oxford University and Stuart Hameroff of the\nUniversity of Arizona have proposed a very different way to understand\nthe workings of the brain. They focus on the much smaller scale structures\nwithin neurons called tubulin microtubules. If you watch a brain form,\nthe dendrites grow towards each other, twisting and turning rather like\nthe growth of a plant as viewed in a slow motion nature film. This motion\nis controlled by micro-tubular structures formed of a protein called\ntubulin. Tubulin is made from peanut-shaped polar molecules that self-\nassemble into helical tubes with a radius of just seven molecules. The\ntubes bundle together to form the backbone of neurons. The peanut-\nshaped molecules are bipolar switches and can flip between two states.\nThis allows them to bend into different shapes and, in the most extreme\nexample, to flap fast enough to propel small organisms such as paramecia.\nIt is also, interestingly, the protein that unzips the double helix when a\ncell divides, and so plays a fundamental role in our evolution.\n\nPenrose and Hameroff suggest these tubes form the true processing\nelement in our brains. The walls of the tubes are formed of successive\nalpha and beta tubulin molecules. Each of the tubulin molecules can\nflip between two states, propagating a ripple along the tube wall. The\nscale is small enough for quantum effects to matter, and Hameroff\nsuggests quantum error correction keeps the ripples from decohering\ntoo fast. Because the processing is happening at a molecular level\nrather than at the scale of a neuron, the brain would be considerably\nmore powerful than a count of its neurons would suggest. They propose\nincreased computing power would stem from three sources: There are\nmany more tubulin molecules than neurons; the micro-tubes could\nperform quantum computation, and the micro-tubes are capable of non-\ncomputable, conscious, thought.\n\nMeasurement of a quantum process is the only candidate we\nhave for a non-deterministic physical process today; all other physical\nprocesses are deterministic. Penrose argues that quantum processing\nin the brain spontaneously collapses in decision making because of\nthe interaction between quantum superposition and gravity. The\narguments are put forward in two books: The Emperor’s New Mind and\nShadows of the Mind. This theory remains controversial for two main\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_015972\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

He called the attacks “an act of war’ and said we should “respond in\nkind.” We did move troops and tanks to the border. But my view, which Rabin\nshared, was that a major ground operation would risk miring ourselves more\ndeeply without fundamentally improving the situation. Hizbollah was the kind\nof nonconventional enemy | had in mind when Id taken stock of Israel’s\nchanging security imperatives on becoming chief of staff. It was a small force,\nentrenched and well armed, increasingly supported by Iran and Syria. Its tactics\nrested on quick-hit attacks on our soldiers in south Lebanon. Far from fearing\nmilitary retaliation, Hizbollah knew that short of a 1982-scale war — and maybe\neven then — it would survive. It also didn’t care whether Lebanese civilians died\nin the crossfire. In fact, like the PLO fighters who had controlled the area before\n1982, Hizbollah deliberately fired into Israel from civilian areas.\n\nNeither Rabin nor I had abandoned the idea of a large-scale military\noperation at some point, particularly if the cross-border rocket fire didn’t\nsubside, which for a while it did. But we were determined that, if and when we\ndid decide to strike, we would avoid anything on the scale of the 1982 war. It\nwould have to be with a clear, finite and achievable goal.\n\nThat point finally arrived in the summer of 1993. In addition to renewed\nKatyusha strikes, there was a series of deadly Hizbollah attacks in the first two\nweeks of July inside the security zone. Each used what was becoming the tactic\nof choice: a remotely detonated bomb by the side of the road on which our\nmilitary vehicles were travelling, followed by an ambush of soldiers who\nsurvived the blast. Six Israelis had been killed in all, making it the largest\nmonthly toll in three years. When I went to see Rabin with our plan for a\nmilitary response, I recognized the risks. It would be the largest military\noperation in Lebanon since the war. But I believed we could limit civilian\ncasualties, and that it was the only approach that might lead to a significant\nreduction in the missile attacks on northern Israel. I began with the assumption\nthat, left to its own devices, Hizbollah would have no incentive to stop firing.\nSince the two Arab governments with the potential to rein in the attacks —\nLebanon’s and above all Syria’s — were showing no interest in doing so, we had\nto find a way to hold them to account.\n\nThe operation I proposed was intended to send a message to Beirut and\nDamascus. It would not be a ground invasion as in 1982. Most of the attacks\nwould be from the air, in two stages. The first would target Hizbollah, both in\nsouthern Lebanon and in the Bekaa Valley further north, near the border with\n\n251\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_028099\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

It was a kind of perfect sweet-\nrevenge story: the son of the wronged man (or, in this case—there’s little dispute—the\nguilty-as-charged man) uses his power over the man who wronged his family. But other\naccounts offer a subtler and in a way darker picture. Jared Kushner, like sons-in-law\neverywhere, tiptoes around his father-in-law, carefully displacing as little air as possible:\nthe massive and domineering older man, the reedy and pliant younger one. In the revised\ndeath-of-Chris-Christie story, it is not the deferential Jared who strikes back, but—in some\nsense even more satisfying for the revenge fantasy—Charlie Kushner himself who harshly\ndemands his due. It was his daughter-in-law who held the real influence in the Trump\ncircle, who delivered the blow.

But Trump pronounced\nmany people in favor of it anyway.\n\nIn the weeks leading up to the election, Trump had labeled Bannon a flatterer for his\ncertainty that Trump would win. But now he had come to credit Bannon with something\nlike mystical powers. And in fact Bannon, with no prior political experience, was the only\nTrump insider able to offer a coherent vision of Trump’s populism—aka Trumpism.\n\nThe anti-Bannon forces—which included almost every non-Tea Party Republican—\nwere quick to react.

Joe Scarborough, the former congressman and cohost of MSNBC’s\nMorning Joe, a favorite Trump show, privately told Trump “Washington will go up in\nflames” if Bannon became chief of staff, and, beginning a running theme, publicly\ndenigrated Bannon on the show.\n\nIn fact, Bannon presented even bigger problems than his politics: he was profoundly\ndisorganized, seemingly on the spectrum given what captured his single-minded focus to\nthe disregard of everything else.

The first process works on every even tick\nof the computer clock and the other on every odd tick. Now we have a\nsingle machine running two branches at the same time. Using this trick\nover and over again, a single machine can run a program exploring every\npossible branch. Although it generates an enormous number of branches\nand takes a huge time to run, it is still a single machine and we have an\ninfinity of time on our hands. Therefore, the machine is limited as before.\n\nWe are not doing well so far and we have already exhausted an\ninfinite number of options! Let’s try a different tack. We know true\nrandomness is non-computable, the sort of randomness generated by\nthe Lavarand we examined earlier in the book. Might this help? Truly\nrandom processes can’t be simulated by a computer. If we throw this into\nthe pot might it let us compute something a Turing machine cannot?\n\nAgain, no.\n\nThis idea still only generates a machine as powerful as the non-\ndeterministic machine above. A non-deterministic Turing machine runs\nevery possible program. All a random one does is choose some of the\nsame paths at random. It, therefore, can’t be any more powerful. The one\ndifference is that it can generate non-computable numbers. However, the\nonly interesting characteristic of these numbers is they are truly random\nand this randomness was an input. Their presence does not make the\nmachine any more powerful.\n\nThere are quite a few proposals for hyper-computers that are just\ncleverly dressed up versions of the machines we have already met and\ndismissed. For example, it has been proposed the Internet could form\na super-Turing machine. This is known as a site machine because the\nprocessing is distributed across many sites linked together through the\nInternet. It is proposed each site could act as an oracle to the others. This\nis quite an elegant idea, and some proofs have been offered that show\nsuch a machine is capable of generating non-computable functions. The\nproblem with this idea is that you can simply draw an imaginary line\naround the whole site machine and it looks exactly like a big Turing\nmachine. There is no conceptual difference between such a machine\nand a regular computer with subroutines. After all, that’s in Turing’s\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_015966\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

After a careful textual analysis of the\nstatute and its structure, the Court ruled that the defendant’s conviction could be sustained only if\nhe knew that the transportation of funds to Mexico was designed to conceal their nature,\nlocation, source, ownership or control—not merely that the defendant knew that the Funds had\nbeen hidden during their transportation to Mexico. Slip op. at 10-17.\n\nBoth decisions relied on the ordinary meaning of the statutory terms Congress chose.\nAnd both rejected attempts to broaden those words to cover conduct not clearly targeted by\nCongress. Taken together, these decisions reject the notion that prosecutors can take language\nfrom a narrowly drawn federal statute—especially one that itself federalizes the prosecution of\nconduct traditionally within the heartland of State police powers—and convert it into a license to\nreach additional conduct by ignoring, rewriting or expansively interpreting the law. Both cases\nadditionally rejected the notion that statutes should be broadly construed in order to facilitate\nprosecutions or to in anyway diminish the burden on prosecutors to prove each essential element\nof a federal charge in conformity with Congress’s determinations as to what is within the federal\ncriminal law and what is not. The conflict between the Santos and Cuellar decisions and\nCEOS’s grant of effectively unlimited discretionary authority to the USAO to take federal law to\n“novel” places where they have never reached before could not be starker.\n\nThese lessons have no less force in the context of Executive Branch decision-making\nthan they do in the context of Judicial interpretation. As you are aware, when federal prosecutors\nexercise their discretion, they bear an independent constitutional obligation to faithfully interpret\nthe law as written—not to broaden its scope beyond the limits endorsed by both Congress and\nthe President. There is no support for CEOS’s view that the courts or a jury should ultimately\ndecide whether a “novel” construction of the law is correct. Instead, the Executive Branch itself\nhas a non-delegable obligation not to exceed its authority; the power of other branches to check\nor remedy such usurpation does not legitimize executive action that exceeds its bounds.

What’s more, it is incumbent\n\non the United States government and American society as a whole not to demonize\nChinese Americans for their feelings for and pride in China. However, it is also important\nthat all American citizens be aware that such feelings can sometimes be exploited by an\nauthoritarian regime to advance its goals and interests. Here it is not Chinese Americans who\nare at fault for having an attachment to their “motherland,” but it is the Chinese Communist\nParty for cynically attempting to use Chinese Americans to further its own interests in the\nprocess making overseas Chinese communities vulnerable to distrust.\n\nSection 3\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_020494\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

That's not totally out of the question, but if he\ndoes so, that's not with the idea of giving up so much as temporarily\ntaking refuge there in order to continue on as the leader of Libya.\n\nSo I think that there's every reason to believe that what we are seeing\nis the last act, but it could be prolonged until they actually succeed in\ncapturing him. Of course part of what makes it so difficult for him to\nleave is the indictment by the International Criminal Court in the\nHague. His son Saif al-Islam is also indicted for crimes against\nhumanity. So there really is no way out for him. I think it's important\nto note that his most important audience is the mirror. And when he\nsays these things he really does believe them. It's sounds crazy, but\nit's kind of like, \"Mirror, mirror, on the wall, who's the most\nimportant Muslim Arab Third World leader of them all?\" And the\nanswer is, \"You, Muammar.\" He is really going have a very difficult\ntime seeing people celebrating his going down, in terms of trying to\nsustain that heroic inner image.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_024598\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

But it also offers a view into a more\nextraordinary and unprecedented problem: a decision by some of America’s closest allies in\nthe Middle East to leverage their financial resources in common cause with a bunch\n\nof gane/s to influence U.S. foreign policy. It is a problem that can be traced back, in ways\nthat haven’t generally been understood, to Trump’s son-in-law and senior advisor Jared\nKushner and his mobile phone.\n\nFrom the perspective of the leaders of Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Israel (there\nis an Israeli angle to the George Nader story, but it isn’t yet entirely clear), and Egypt, there\nwas an entirely rational reason to support Trump’s presidential bid and try to influence his\napproach to the Middle East: They did not like former President Barack Obama’s Middle\nEast policy. And while they likely understood that presidential nominee Hillary Clinton was\nmore hawkish that the president she served as secretary of state, the Saudis, Emiratis, and\nIsraelis were concerned that she would be tethered to the Iran nuclear deal and thus Obama’s\nIran policy.\n\nThey also believed that Clinton would be soft on Islamists. It is an article of faith in Egypt\nthat she enabled the rise of the Muslim Brotherhood and Mohamed Morsi in 2011 and 2012.\nFor countries in the Persian Gulf, Egypt provides strategic depth, and “losing” it to the\nMuslim Brotherhood was a major geopolitical blow. The Israelis, for obvious reasons, were\ndeeply concerned about the accumulation of Islamist political power next door and blamed\nthe Obama administration for abandoning Hosni Mubarak, thereby placing Israel’s security\nin jeopardy.\n\nWith Trump, Washington’s allies got a candidate and president who referred to the Iran\nnuclear agreement as the “worst deal ever,” surrounded himself with people who either\nmake no distinction between al Qaeda and the Muslim Brotherhood or are simply outright\nIslamophobes, and has forthrightly declared that the United States supports its friends in the\nfight against terrorism. Full stop. No caveats, buts, or howevers concerning human rights\nand the need for political reform. To them, this seemed a lot better than the appreciation of\nnuance and complexity that was a hallmark of the Obama administration.\n\nOf course, even if an American president shares a given ally’s view of the world, diplomacy\ndoes not stop. The job of ambassadors, foreign ministers, and other representatives of\nforeign governments is to keep the United States on their side. Traditionally, this is done\nthrough formal discussions with U.S. officials at the State Department, National Security\nCouncil, and Department of Defense; meetings with members of Congress; writing op-eds in\ninfluential media outlets; and informal channels of influence, notably the Washington social\ncircuit of dinners, embassy garden parties, national day events and the like.

Like these judicially\nrecognized powers, the notice-posting\nrequirement that is the subject of this\nrulemaking has not been specifically\nprovided for by Congress. But the cited\ncases demonstrate that Congress need\nnot expressly list a power for the Board\nto legitimately exercise it. Indeed, the\nnotice-posting requirement is not even\nan implied power of the Board in the\nsame sense as those previously\nmentioned. Rather, it is the product of\nthe Board’s exercise of express\nrulemaking authority and inherent gap-\nfilling authority, both of which have\nbeen delegated to the Board by\nCongress.\n\n2. The First Amendment and Section\n8(c) of the NLRA\n\nA handful of commenters argue that\nthe notice-posting requirement violates\nthe First Amendment to the\nConstitution, Section 8(c) of the NLRA,\nor both. For example, the Center on\nNational Labor Policy, Inc. maintains\nthat “compelling an employer to post its\nproperty with a Notice that asserts the\nstatutory ‘rights’ and employer\nobligations, runs counter to\nconstitutional views long protected by\nthe Supreme Court.”’ The Center also\nargues that the “proposed poster would\nimpede the employer’s statutory right to\nexpress itself on its own property.”\nAlong these same lines, the National\nRight to Work Legal Defense\nFoundation, Inc. and others on whose\nbehalf it writes contend that ‘‘the\nBoard’s proposal for forced speech\nfavoring unionization directly conflicts\nwith the First Amendment and\nlongstanding federal labor policy under\nSection 8(c) that employers and unions\nshould be able to choose themselves\nwhat to say about unionization.” These\nconcerns were echoed by the National\nAssociation of Wholesaler-Distributors.\nIn addition, two attorneys affiliated with\nPilchak Cohen & Tice, P.C., which they\ndescribe as “a management-side labor\nand employment law firm,” argue that\nthe notice-posting requirement\n“tramples upon employers’ Free Speech\nrights by regulating the content of\ninformation that employers are required\nto tell employees and by compelling\nthem to post the Notice containing pro-\nunion NLRA rights, when it is almost\nassuredly not the employers’ prerogative\nto do so.”’ The Independent Association\nof Bakers goes further and characterizes\nthe regulation as an unconstitutional\n“eae order’ that “prohibits the\n\nemployer from telling the truth about\nthe impact a union might pose to his\nbusiness.” The Board rejects these\narguments.\n\nAs an initial matter, requiring a notice\nof employee rights to be posted does not\nviolate the First Amendment, which\nprotects the freedom of speech. Indeed,\nthis rule does not involve employer\nspeech at all. The government, not the\nemployer, will produce and supply\nposters informing employees of their\nlegal rights. The government has sole\nresponsibility for the content of those\nposters, and the poster explicitly states\nthat it is an “official Government\nNotice’; nothing in the poster is\nattributed to the employer. In fact, an\nemployer has no obligation beyond\nputting up this government poster.\nThese same considerations were present\nin Lake Butler Apparel Co. v. Secretary\nof Labor, 519 F.2d 84, 89 (5th Cir. 1975),\nwhere the Fifth Circuit rejected as\n“nonsensical” an employer’s First\nAmendment challenge to the\nOccupational Safety and Health Act\nrequirement that it post an ‘‘information\nsign’’ similar to the one at issue here. As\nin Lake Butler, an employer subject to\nthe Board’s rule retains the right to\n“differ with the wisdom of * * * this\nrequirement even to the point * * * of\nchallenging its validity. * * * But the\nFirst Amendment which gives him the\nfull right to contest validity to the bitter\nend cannot justify his refusal to post a\nnotice * * * thought to be essential.”\nId.; see also Stockwell Mfg. Co. v. Usery,\n536 F.2d 1306, 1309-10 (10th Cir. 1976)\n(dicta) (rejecting a constitutional\nchallenge to a requirement that an\nemployer post a copy of an OSHA\ncitation).\n\nBut even if the Board’s notice-posting\nrequirement is construed to compel\nemployer speech, the Supreme Court\nhas recognized that governments have\n“substantial leeway in determining\nappropriate information disclosure\nrequirements for business\ncorporations.” Pac. Gas & Elec. Co. v.\nPub. Utils. Comm’n, 475 U.S. 1, 15 n.12\n(1985). This discretion is particularly\nwide when the government requires\ninformation disclosures relevant to the\nemployment relationship. Thus, as the\nD.C. Circuit has observed, ‘‘an\nemployer’s right to silence is sharply\nconstrained in the labor context, and\nleaves it subject to a variety of burdens\nto post notices of rights and risks.”\nUAW-Labor Employment & Training\nCorp. v. Chao, 325 F.3d 360, 365 (D.C.\nCir. 2003) (UAW v. Chao) (citing Lake\nButler, 519 F.2d at 89). Accordingly, the\nBoard’s notice-posting requirement is\n\nnot susceptible to a First Amendment\nchallenge.*4\n\nThe Board is equally satisfied that the\nrule does not violate NLRA Section 8(c),\n29 U.S.C. 158(c), which creates a safe\nharbor for noncoercive speech in the\nunfair labor practice area. Specifically,\nSection 8(c) shields from unfair labor\npractice liability “‘[t]he expressing of\nany views, argument or opinion,”\nprovided that “such expression contains\nno threat of reprisal or force or promise\nof benefit.” Id. (emphasis added). A\ngovernment poster containing accurate,\nfactual information about employees’\nlegal rights “merely states what the law\nrequires.” Lake Butler, 519 F.2d at 89.\nFor that reason, “[t]he posting of the\nnotice does not by any stretch of the\nimagination reflect one way or the other\non the views of the employer.” Id.4°\n\n44 The decision of the intermediate state court in\nSmith v. Fair Employment & Housing Commission,\n30 Cal. Rptr. 2d 395 (Cal. Ct. App. 1994), rev’d on\nother grounds, 913 P.2d 909 (Cal. 1996), lends no\nsupport to arguments challenging these regulations\non First Amendment grounds. There, the California\nCourt of Appeal held that a landlord’s right to\nfreedom of speech was “‘implicate[d],” id. at 401—\n02, by a state fair housing agency’s remedial order\nrequiring her to sign, post, and distribute notices\n“setting out the provisions of [the fair housing\nstatute], the outcome of th[e] case, and the\nstatement that [she] practices equal housing\nopportunity.” 913 P.2d at 914. The Smith case is\nnot persuasive here because the notice at issue in\nSmith would not merely have set forth the rights\nof prospective buyers or renters but also would\nhave contained a signed statement from the\nlandlord which would have given the false\nappearance that she agreed with the state’s fair\nhousing “concepts and rules,” despite her religious\nbeliefs to the contrary. 30 Cal. Rptr. 2d at 401. That\nfeature of the case has no parallel here. Here, by\ncontrast, employers are not required to sign the\ninformational notice, and as noted, nothing in the\nposter is attributed to them. The Board further notes\nthat the Smith decision is not authoritative because\nit was superseded by the California Supreme\nCourt’s grant of review in that case. See 913 P.2d\nat 916 n.*.\n\n45 The Employers Association of New Jersey is\ntherefore off the mark when it argues that the\nnotice-posting requirement is preempted under the\nprinciples of Lodge 76, International Ass’n of\nMachinists & Aerospace Workers v. Wisconsin\nEmployment Relations Commission, 427 U.S. 132\n(1976), as an attempt to regulate employer speech\n“about unionization and collective bargaining.” As\nexplained above, the employer’s choice whether to\nexpress its own views, arguments, or opinions is\nwholly unaffected by a requirement to post a\ngovernment-provided notice summarizing what the\nlaw requires. Indeed, consistent with both\nMachinists and the policy of Section 8(c) “‘to\nencourage free debate on issues dividing labor and\nmanagement,’ Brown, 554 U.S. at 67 (quoting Linn\nv. United Plant Guard Workers, Local 114, 383 U.S.\n53, 62 (1966)), employers remain free under this\nrule—as they have in the past—to express\nnoncoercive views regarding the exercise of these\nrights as well as others. See, e.g., United Techs.\nCorp., 274 N.L.R.B. 609, 609, 618-20, 624-26\n(1985), enforced sub nom. NLRB v. Pratt & Whitney\nAir Craft Div.v., United Techs.

How will bacteria and \noverwintering insects be affected \nby changing freeze-thaw cycles? \nScientists will design and study \nmore temperate ecosystems, \nas well, to learn how changes \nin temperature and CO2 affect \nthe growth of photosynthetic \norganisms, including crops and \nboreal forest, \nBiotron researchers will also be \nable to study the benefits and risks \nof biotechnology in agriculture, \nforestry, and medicine by examin-\ning the basic biology of genetically \nmodified organisms: What is the \nrate of gene transfer from trans-\ngenic plants to wild ones? Can \nplants be engineered to manufac-\nture medicinal compounds that \nwill benefit humans? \nThe Biotron will be equipped \nwith a sophisticated imaging and \nanalysis system—a virtual control \nroom—that will expand its reach \nglobally, allowing researchers \nanywhere to manage and moni-\ntor experiments remotely over \nthe Internet in real time. A scien.-\nfist in India studying the impact \nof climate change on rice could \ninstruct the Biotron to raise the \ntemperature or CO2 concentra-\ntion in a biome set up to simulate \na SouthAsian rice paddy. Then he \nor she could monitor the impact \nof this change through images \nand other data automatically col-\nlected and stored in a supercom-\npuling network \nResearchers will vie for access \nto the Biotron in much the same \nway that physicists compete to \nuse the world's few particle accel-\nerators or astronomers the latest \nand biggest optical telescopes. \nlike them, itis a. place for frontier \nscience, where old models will fall \nand new and unexpected ones will \narise—except that the goal is not \nto understand our cosmic origins \nbut to influence our destiny. \nThrough personal care products, the average American child is exposed to 27 chemicals daily that have not been proven safe \nFar From \nNirvana \nNEW YORK CITY'S AMITABHA \nBuddhists are full of good \nintentions.

Despite that agreement, we note that your letters of April 8, April 28,\nand May 14 focus in large part on accusations of investigative or prosecutorial misconduct. Not\nonly do allegations of prosecutorial misconduct fall outside the boundary of our agreed review,\nthey also fall outside the authority of the Criminal Division in the first instance. Simply, the\nCriminal Division does not investi gate or resolve allegations of professional misconduct by\nfederal prosecutors. For these Teasons, we do not respond to the portion of those letters that\ndiscuss alleged misconduct,\n\nBased on our review of all of these materials, and after careful consideration of the issues,\nwe conclude that U.S. Attomey Acosta could properly use his discretion to authorize prosecution\nin this case. We will briefly address each of the issues that you have raised,\n\nKnowledge of age. Federal child exploitation statutes differ as to whether there must be\nproof that the defendant was aware that the children were under the age of 18. However, even\nfor those statutes where knowledge of age is an element of the offense, it is possible to satisfy\nthat element with proof that the defendant was deliberately ignorant of facts which would suggest\nthat the person was a minor. For that reason, the fact that some of the individuals allegedly lied\nto Mr. Epstein about their age is not dispositive of the issue. While there may be an open factual\nissue as to Mr. Epstein’s knowledge, we cannot say that it would be impossible to prove\nknowledge of age for any such charges which require it. Therefore, Mr. Acosta could rightfully\nconclude that this factual issue is best resolved by a jury.\n\nTravel for the purpose. In the materials you prepared, you suggest that Mr. Epstein\nshould not be charged with violating 18 U.S.C. § 2423(b) because his dominant purpose in going\nto Florida was not to engage in iNegal sexual activity, but rather to return to one of his residences,\nWhile we fully understand your argument, we also find that the U.S. Attorney’s office has a good\nfaith basis fully to develop the facts on this issue and brief the law to permit a court to decide\nwhether the law properly reaches such conduct. Mr. Acosta would not be abusing his discretion\nif he decided to pursue such a course of action,\n\n2\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_012671\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

For purposes of this Investment Rating Distribution, the coverage universe includes only stocks. A\nstock rated Neutral is included as a Hold, and a stock rated Underperform is included as a Sell.\n\nFUNDAMENTAL EQUITY OPINION KEY: Opinions include a Volatility Risk Rating, an Investment Rating and an Income Rating. VOLATILITY RISK RATINGS, indicators of potential\nprice fluctuation, are: A - Low, B - Medium and C - High. INVESTMENT RATINGS reflect the analyst’s assessment of a stock’s: (i) absolute total return potential and (ii)\nattractiveness for investment relative to other stocks within its Coverage Cluster (defined below). There are three investment ratings: 1 - Buy stocks are expected to have a total\nreturn of at least 10% and are the most attractive stocks in the coverage cluster; 2 - Neutral stocks are expected to remain flat or increase in value and are less attractive than\nBuy rated stocks and 3 - Underperform stocks are the least attractive stocks in a coverage cluster. Analysts assign investment ratings considering, among other things, the 0-12\nmonth total return expectation for a stock and the firm’s guidelines for ratings dispersions (shown in the table below). The current price objective for a stock should be\nreferenced to better understand the total return expectation at any given time. The price objective reflects the analyst’s view of the potential price appreciation (depreciation).\n\nInvestment rating Total return expectation (within 12-month period of date of initial rating) Ratings dispersion guidelines for coverage cluster*\n\nBuy = 10% < 10%\nNeutral = 0% = 30%\nUnderperform NIA = 20%\n\n*Ratings dispersions may vary from time to time where BofA Merrill Lynch Research believes it better reflects the investment prospects of stocks in a Coverage Cluster.\n\nINCOME RATINGS, indicators of potential cash dividends, are: 7 - same/higher (dividend considered to be secure), 8 - same/lower (dividend not considered to be secure) and 9 - pays\nno cash dividend. Coverage Cluster is comprised of stocks covered by a single analyst or two or more analysts sharing a common industry, sector, region or other classification(s).

In private meetings, Bibi did sometimes engage in discussion\nabout what Israel might do. But he invariably steered the conversation elsewhere,\ninsisting that the real issue was the Palestinians’ lack of any interest in making\npeace.\n\nMy main worry wasn’t the immediate future of the negotiations. For now, the\nchances of an agreement seemed close to zero. It was the longer-term damage\nBibi’s approach would do in further delaying any serious move by Israel to put our\nrelations with the Palestinians on a more stable and sustainable footing. The\ndithering, delay and deadlock suited him politically. Ironically, my own efforts on\nthe security front had also made it easier for us to do next to nothing. Intermittent\noutbreaks of violence always remained a threat. Yet the West Bank security fence,\nalong with our military, police and intelligence measures, meant it was very\nunlikely we’d see a return to the full-blown terror war of the second intifada. I was\nalso working to secure US support for our development of increasingly effective\nanti-missile weapons to reduce the threat from Hamas in Gaza. The overall result\nwas that for many, if not most, Israelis, the conflict with the Palestinians didn’t\nimpact on their day-to-day lives. It was unseen and largely unfelt.\n\nStill, the effect of the stalemate on our relationship with Washington did matter:\nboth for our security cooperation on things like the anti-missile weapons and,\ncrucially, the challenge which had led me into Bibi’s government in the first place:\nkeeping Iran from getting a nuclear weapon.\n\nIt was a race against time. The Iranians were producing more and more\nyellowcake, building more advanced centrifuges, accumulating more low-enriched\nuranium. They were getting better at hiding and protecting the network of facilities\nbeing used to try to produce a nuclear weapon. And in the early months of Bibi’s\nPrime Ministership, the question we faced wasn’t even whether to take military\naction against Iran — something I knew, from Bob Gates and others, that the\nObama administration viewed no more favourably than George W. Bush.

The\nfight started and the men were going bezerk, screaming at the fighters in\nthe ring offering either fighter their support or discrimination depending\n\non whom they were batting for. It was like watching a primitive scene out\n\nof the days when the cavemen ruled the earth but it was as equally\nalluring to watch unfold, the sweat, the blood and the absolute brut\nfascination of it all.\n\nAfter the fight and all of the men revved up from the fight, I suggested\nthat we all head to the pizza joint in front of the Princess Hotel where |\nwas staying for a late night snack. I made it my goal to make myself\nknown to this appealing stranger. In the tuk-tuk on the way there [ made\nsure I sat next to Robbie. Scooting my knees closer and closer to him on\nthe short ride he continued his chase by moving further away from me, a\ngame of cat and mouse that I loved. When he answered back the array of\nmy questions he had the cutest Aussie accent that drove me absolutely\nwild.\n\nGradually we got to know each other better over a pie of peperoni\npizza and two can’s of coke. Too me he might as well have been the only\nother person in the restaurant, he knew he had my undivided attention and\nI think he liked it. There was no one like him that [ had ever met before\nand I knew there was no other who could make me feel the way that I felt\nat the first sight of him.

He\ntherefore quite truly denies his guilt in the one case, but in doing so betrays his sense of\nguilt with regard to the other. The adult neurotic behaves in this and in many other ways\njust as the child does. People of this kind are often to be met, and it is indeed a question\nwhether your technique will succeed in distinguishing such self-accused persons from\nthose who are really guilty.\n\nIn addition to citing Freud and dozens of other psychological sources, I also invoked my favorite\nnovelist, Dostoevski, noting that in the Brothers Karamazov:\n\n“the author describes how Ivan—the brother who had desired death of the father but had\nnot perpetrated the act—manifests all the traditional symptoms of guilt described by\nWigmore, whereas the actual murderer reacts in a cool dispassionate way,\nconsistent—according to Wigmore—with innocence.”\n\nJudge Bazelon approved of my somewhat sophomoric display of erudition, so long as at least one\nother judge agreed to reverse the conviction and order a new trial with a proper instruction on\nflight and guilt.'*®\n\nJudge Fahey did agree, while writing a short concurrence. Judge Burger wrote a scathing\ndissent—arguing that our proposed instruction “may be appropriate to a philosophical\ninterchange between judges, lawyers and experts in psychology...but was unnecessary to a jury.”\nJudge Bazelon assured me that Burger’s dissent “proves we’re right.”\n\nAll in all the Bazelon clerkship proved to be a turning point in my life. He helped shape me into\nthe person I have become. He influenced me as a lawyer, teacher, writer, public intellectual and\nas a liberal Jew. His highest praise for any person was that he or she “is a mensch.” I have\naspired to that accolade. When Judge Bazelon retired in 1985, I wrote the following about his\ncontributions to our nation:\n\nDavid Bazelon is certainly not a household name to most Americans. Yet Judge\nBazelon—who just retired after thirty six years of distinguished service on the US Court\nof Appeals for the District of Columbia—has been your conscience in Washington since\n1949.\n\nNo single judge—whether on the Supreme Court, the lower federal courts or the state\ncourts—has had a more profound impact on the law’s sensitivity to human needs.\n\n'8 The new instructions were to follow these principles:\n\n“When evidence of flight has been introduced into a case, in my opinion the trial court should, if\nrequested, explain to the jury, in appropriate language, that flight does not necessarily reflect feelings of\nguilt, and that feelings of guilt, which are present in many innocent people, do not necessarily reflect\nactual guilt. This explanation may help the jury to understand and follow the instruction which should\nthen be given, that they are not to presume guilt from flight; that they may, but need not, consider flight\nas one circumstance tending to show feelings of guilt; and that they may, but need not, consider feelings\nof guilt as evidence tending to show actual guilt.”\n\n59\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_017146\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

The political\n\nprocess, more than any system I’ve ever worked with, thrives on pointing out mistakes and overlooking successes. My advice\nto many candidates has been to speak as little as possible and to describe policies in as general a manner as you can get\naway with. People aren’t looking through your transcripts to find the next wonderful and positive thing you’ve done, but instead\nthey try to find your missteps, transgressions, faux pas and failures. Politics is a totally negative process. You live or die by\nthe sum total of what you’ve done wrong, not on the balance between what you’ve done right and what you’ve done wrong.\nIn the words of Shakespeare, “the good is oft interred with their bones.”6\n\nTrump has had very limited exposure as a practicing politician and, therefore, has only his own words and phrases to criticize.\nWhile he may have a number of missteps in business or in his personal life, no one cares. And yet, he truly enjoys celebrity\nstatus as no one in politics today does. Also, given how much Trump has said about any number of issues over the past couple\nof years, there are probably quotes that can be used on any side of most any issue. But with Hillary, it’s different.\n\nHillary has done a lot. She’s been involved in politics at a visible level since the Watergate hearings and maybe even earlier.\nHer past contains numerous misdeeds and failures as much because she’s done so much and perhaps not so much because\nshe has been a failure. Yet, a diligent, hard-driving researcher can find a laundry list of her significant misdeeds.\n\nTo wit,\n\ne As events have unfolded, her vote in favor of the Iraq War is a clear sign of poor political judgment, especially in her party.\n\ne Her behavior surrounding the attack on the consulate in Benghazi and the failure to respond to four American deaths sure\nlooks like a case of poor judgment.\n\ne Her use of a private e-mail server while Secretary of State and thus the potential exposure of critical U.S. intelligence to\nthose who would do us harm again smacks of poor judgement.\n\ne The Clinton Foundation along with its big gifts and extraordinarily large speaking fees surely creates an aura of impropriety,\nfavoritism and the absence of sound judgement.\n\ne Her involvement in the cover-up of Fast and Furious is transparent bad judgment.\n\ne Her disregard for coal miners and coal companies in her reckless quest to be seen as a defender of the environment is yet\nanother case of dangerous judgement.\n\ne The IRS scandal: While not directly implicated as a participant in an administration cover-up of the Cincinnati IRS office\nheaded by Lois Lerner’s misuse of government power, there are definite indications of her gross negligence in the pursuit\nof even-handed fairness of the power to tax.\n\ne As | have predicted,’ Obamacare has not only driven considerable premium increases for coverage since 2013, when the\nmarketplace first opened for enrollment, but has also added significant cost burdens onto health insurance companies,\nmany of whom are choosing to leave the Obamacare marketplace as costs continue to outpace profits. This has led to\nentire states, such as Alaska and Alabama, being left with only one insurer on their respective Obamacare marketplaces,\nwith 650 counties total being left with just one insurer in 2017.°\n\ne Her personal investments in cattle futures.° In the late 1970s, she turned an initial investment of $1,000 into $100,000 in\njust 10 months, despite having no previous investment experience. Her close friend, James Blair, an experienced\ncommodities trader, advised her to enter the commodities market, but Clinton claimed to have made her own investment\ndecisions. One academic study published in The Journal of Economics and Finance estimated the likelihood of achieving\na result such as Clinton’s as 1 in 31 trillion.’°\n\n® William Shakespeare, The Tragedy of Julius Caesar, Act Ill, Scene 2, Line 1620.\n\n’ Arthur B.

This record appeared to have had little impact on the nation’s dominant global\nposition; it did little to unnerve a comfortable sense of national destiny.\n\nMuch of our current confidence can be measured by the astonishing degree to which\nwe embrace the scrambling of even the most elemental parts of our lives, from how\nwe bank to how we drive. Most societies in the past were largely terrified of\ndisruption. If you had arrived in prosperous 17 century Holland and proposed to\n“disrupt agriculture,” or radically change people’s banking habits, you would have\nbeen lynched. Our age is different. Many of the most unsettling forces in our world\nare ones we encourage, feed and push along. If I had said to you a decade ago - “I’m\ngoing to record all of your movements so you can spend less time in traffic.” - is that\nreally a deal you would have accepted? But if you use a GPS mapping system on your\nphone, you have. That Orwell's sick prognostication of technocratic life would be\none you'd embrace? That it would describe a desireable feature of network life?\n“You had to live - did live, from habit that became instinct - in the assumption that\nevery sound you made was overheard, and ... every movement scrutinized.”*° If I\nhad told you we were going to build a world wide high-speed data system that\nwould, as a side effect, make it simple for children in London to connect with, learn\nfrom and then join terrorists in Syria - would you have thought that wise?\n\nThe optimistic bumper sticker of our age - that any disruption is good disruption -\nmarks a wonderful feature of the American character. It is, perhaps, to be expected\nof a nation built by immigrants who overturned their own lives in the hopes of\nsomething better. To pull up and leave home for a land where you did not speak the\nlanguage, knew little of the culture, and faced a blank sheet of the future, demanded\nfaith. You had to believe too: Any disruption is good disruption. But no nation, even\nthe most heroically hopeful, is immune from the forces of history. Edmund Burke’s\nold line, that “every revolution contains within it the seeds of evil,” runs like a\ncounterpoint through the hopeful music of the age now. America’s remarkable spirit\ndoes not make the demand for a national outlook, for an American grand strategy,\nany less real. We’re starting to be aware of just how dangerous this age can really\nbe. In many ways, our very confidence and sometimes blindly certain feeling of\ndestiny probably makes it even more essential that we have a sense, as we rest in\nSilicon Valley or Iowa or wherever, of where we are going, and why.\n\nThe phrase “grand strategy” is one that carries a particular meaning when we think\nabout problems of global balance. It means the way in which ail of a nation’s\npowerful tools of economics, finance, ideology, politics, and other resources can be\nused, together, in the service of security and prosperity.5!

The Fund\nManagers’ combination of proven track record, in-depth knowledge of the medical device and\ndiagnostics fields, a strong current LC. portfolio, and a thought-leading network of LC.\nadvisors, puts New Leaf in a position of leadership within this sector.\n\nMEDICAL DEVICES INVESTMENT STRATEGY\n\nNLV-III’s investment strategy in medical devices will focus on identifying a limited number of\ninvestment opportunities in companies with compelling later stage risk profiles. The Fund will\nseek to identify investments in companies that are developing innovative and differentiated\nmedical devices, targeting large market opportunities, that offer the potential to meaningfully\nreduce overall patient treatment costs in high morbidity disease settings through substantial\nefficacy and safety benefits versus existing standards of care. Investments in this sector will\nhave established regulatory approval pathways and clear regulatory precedents, or are already\nat the commercial stage at the time of initial investment. The objective will be to identify\ncompanies that because of their specific therapeutic area or technology focus, or because the\ncompany already has received key regulatory approvals, that they will be less affected by the\nheadwinds that are challenging the sector more broadly. Importantly, these investments will be\nin therapeutic areas that are known to be of high strategic interest to a number of larger medical\ndevice companies, and thus have a high potential of generating M&A interest. The primary\nrisks in these investments will be mostly operational execution, competition, and other market\nrelated risks.\n\nSimilar to the second half of the investment period for NLV-I, the Fund will have a more\nlimited focus on medical device investments in NLV-II] compared to previous funds. The\nslower projected pace of investment is based on the view that the operating and exit\nenvironment for companies in this sector will continue to be challenging due to increased\nregulatory and reimbursement uncertainty in the U.S. and E.U. These headwinds have resulted\nin increased development costs and significantly lengthened timelines for most development\nstage companies.\n\nWhile the Fund Managers expect to see fewer compelling investment opportunities than have\nbeen available historically in the medical device sector, they do believe that they will be able to\nidentify and source a number of later stage opportunities that are less affected by these\nobstacles, and that these will be attractive investment opportunities for NLV-III. One factor that\nsupports this view is that the reduced level of competition for deals resulting from the decline\nin the number of active venture capital firms mentioned previously is even more pronounced in\nthe medical device sector. Given New Leaf’s historic leadership within this sector, and its clear\ncommitment to remain active during this period of reduced funding, the Fund Managers expect\nthat they will have excellent deal flow. Although the number of deals in this sector is likely to\nbe somewhat lower than in previous funds, with the later stage focus, it is likely that the size of\ninvestments in this sector will be larger. Recent medical device investments in the New Leaf\nportfolio that fit this later stage definition include: Neuronetics (NLV-II, commercial stage),\nCardioKinetix (NLV-IL, clinical development stage), and Interlace Medical (NLV-I, start-up\nfocused on 510k product, acquired by Hologix, exited at 8.6x).\n\n41 CONTROL NUMBER 257 - CONFIDENTIAL\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_024052\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

Shortly after\nshepherding the CVRA through the Congress, Senator Kyl cowrote a law review article about the Act. '° In that article, he\ndirectly indicated that the CVRA applies before charges are filed. Senator Kyl and his coauthors wrote:\n\nWhile most of the rights guaranteed by the CVRA apply in the context of legal proceedings following arrest and charging, other\nimportant rights are triggered by the harm inflicted by the crime itself. For example, the right to be treated with fairness, the\nright to be reasonably protected from the accused (who may qualify as the accused before his arrest), and the right to be treated\nwith respect for the victim's dignity and privacy each may arise without regard to the existence of legal proceedings. !37\nRemarkably, OLC cited Senator Kyl's law review article (in a footnote), but then concluded without explanation that the\nCVRA cosponsor's views were for some reason different than Congress's. !78\n\nOLC also appears to acknowledge that its interpretation of the CVRA could well contradict what it describes as prosecutorial\n\"good practice.\" ‘3? OLC noted that some Justice Department components (for example, the Environmental and Natural\nResources Division) had advocated that the right to confer should apply during pre-charging plea discussions. '4° OLC then\nacknowledged that limiting the right to confer until after formal charging could \"reduce the impact of a victim's participation in\nsubsequent court proceedings.\" !+! OLC attempted to dodge this problem by explaining: \"The question before us, though, is\nnot whether it would be advisable as a matter of good practice ... for Government attorneys to confer with victims pre-charge\nwhen appropriate ... .\". '4? OLC then explained that even under its narrow interpretation of the statute, \"the CVRA would still\nensure that [*84] the victim has an opportunity to be heard by the court, and by the Government, before the court accepts the\nplea.\" 143\n\nBut OLC failed to recognize that its interpretation of the CVRA rendered the right to be heard a nullity in many important cases\n- including, notably, the Epstein case. !44 Where prosecutors and defense attorneys work out a nonprosecution agreement that\nagreement will never be presented to a court for review. Thus, in cases where the need for victim participation may be the\ngreatest - that is, in cases where the Government is considering never filing any charges - OLC's interpretation would bar\nvictims from having any rights at all.\n\nEven in situations where a prosecutor works out a plea agreement, OLC's interpretation is problematic. As OLC recognizes,\nprosecutors and defense counsel commonly work out pre-indictment plea agreements (particularly in white-collar cases), under\n\n134 Tq,\n\n135 Attorney General Holder never sent a response to Senator Kyl's letter. But Assistant Attorney General Ronald Weich sent a belated\nresponse. Letter from Ronald Weich, Assistant Att'y Gen., to Jon Kyl, U.S. Sen. (Nov. 3, 2011) (on file with authors). That response did not\naddress Senator Kyl's concern that his remarks were being quoted out of context.\n\n36 See generally Kyl et al., supra note 19.\n37 Td. at 594.\n\n38 OLC CVRA Rights Memo, supra note 2, at 8 n.7.\n\n39 Td. at 10.\n\n40 Td. at 9 (citations omitted) (discussing an interdepartmental memorandum addressing this question).\n4!

In the Soviet bloc, elections\nwere a pointless ritual in which citizens were pres-\nsured to go to a polling place and cast ballots for the\nCommunist Party candidate, the only one permitted to\ncompete. Military and postcolonial dictatorships often\ncanceled elections on spurious “national emergency\"\ngrounds, or rigged the outcome through crude bal-\nlot-stuffing and open intimidation.\n\nAt acertain point in the 1980s, however, the strong-\nmen, juntas, and revolutionary councils of the era\nrealized that reasonably fair elections could no longer\nbe avoided. Sometimes a ruling group understood\nthat this would likely lead to an opposition victory. But\nusually, the incumbent leaders—and often foreign\njournalists and diplomats—presumed that voters in\nrepressive settings preferred stability to uncertainty\nand would opt for the reassuring faces of authority.\n\nThese calculations proved wildly misplaced. Opposi-\ntion parties swept to victory in country after coun-\ntry—in Uruguay, Argentina, Nicaragua, South Korea,\nthe Philippines, Poland. The word “stunning” made\n\na frequent appearance in news accounts, as in the\nstunning rejection of the ruling party in Poland, or the\nstunning setback suffered by Chile's Augusto Pinochet\nin a referendum on the continuation of his dicta-\ntorship. Or, perhaps most astonishing, the stunning\ndefeat of Communist Party stalwarts in a number of\nSoviet cities in 1990 local elections.*\n\nElections became a key force behind the wave of de-\nmocratization that engulfed much of the world during\nthat decade. Today, the obligation to hold some form of\nmultiparty balloting is felt by nearly all governments.\n\nThe illusion of pluralism\n\nYet just as with other democratic institutions, modern\nauthoritarians have mastered the techniques of con-\ntrol over the electoral process, maintaining political\ndominance behind a screen of false diversity.\n\nThey have adapted in many ways to the age of the inter-\n\n“We're not perfect. But we do have\ndemocracy.”\n\n—Hugo Chavez\n\n“Yes, we falsified the last election...\n\nIn fact, 93.5 percent [of ballots were]\nfor President Lukashenka. People\nsay this is not a European result, so\nwe changed it to 86 percent.”\n\n—Alyaksandr Lukashenka\n\nnet and the expectations of a better-informed public. In\nthe most sophisticated authoritarian states, profes-\nsional political operatives—in Russia they are called\n“oolitical technologists’—work just as hard as their\ncounterparts in the United States. Their goal, however,\nis not to defeat opposition candidates in a competitive\nsetting, but rather to organize a system that creates the\nillusion of competition while squelching it in reality.\n\nIn most countries, elections are largely “free and fair,\"\nmeaning the playing field is reasonably level, there is an\nhonest tabulation of the ballots, vote buying and ballot\nstuffing do not change the outcome, and independent\nelection observers are allowed to monitor the proceed-\nings. For 2015, Freedom in the World placed the num-\nber of electoral democracies at 125, around 64 percent\nof the world’s sovereign states.? By historical standards,\nthis is an impressive figure. Still, there are 70 countries\nthat do not qualify as electoral democracies. In all but\na few of these settings, elections are indeed held, but\nthey are either badly flawed or patently dishonest.\n\nYet even in systems where elections are tainted or fixed\noutright, authoritarian leaders often claim legitimacy\nfrom the ballot box. Of the countries assessed in this\nstudy, only China rejects elections as part of the leader-\nships strategy for political control. In Russia, Turkey, Ven-\nezuela, and elsewhere, the leadership invokes victory at\nthe polls as a mandate for government, including the\nadoption of policies that are in fact deeply unpopular.\n\nIn some authoritarian states, elections are neither free\nnor fair, with heavy manipulation that directly ensures\n\n10\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_019244\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

Morgan View: Go East.\n\n \n\nClick here <http://emaillink.jpmorgan.com/t/AQ/AAGO5g/AAMcAQ/OFFmSw/EGA/ABYQPQ/AQ/16gv>  for the full Note and disclaimers.\n\n \n\n*         Asset allocation –– The growth gap between East and West is widening, and has allowed us to join the Obama Pivot towards Asia. We stay long Japan and EM Asia in equities on stronger signs of an economic rebound in the East, while we again cut growth numbers for the US and Europe. \n\n*         Economics –– Weaker activity data force us to lower Q4 for the US from 1.5% to 0.8% and the Euro area from -1.5% to -1.8%. But strong trade and industrial data in Asia, as well as more fiscal easing in Japan, have induced us to raise Japanese growth for the 3rd time in a row, and to signal upside risk on China. \n\n*         Fixed Income –– Go long duration in the US as we see yields mean reverting and we are not quite high in the 6-month range. \n\n*         Equities –– Strong retail buying is adding fuel to equity markets. \n\n*         Credit –– Idiosyncrasies driving relative performance signals a welcome move-away from the one-factor-drives-all world of late. \n\n*         Currencies –– Staying short JPY. Be also short USD but against AUD, RUB and KRW. \n\n*         Commodities –– Our main trades are long industrial metals, US natural gas, and Brent time spreads vs. short agriculture. \n\n*         Another good week for risk markets with equities and credit rallying further, but this week without a selloff in bonds. Much of the rally in equities is likely the aftermath of the last minute escape from Fiscal Cliff 1 on December 31. But since then, we have also seen a sudden surge in equity fund inflows, which seem incongruous with lukewarm incoming data and thus may well come from investors who missed last year's stock market rally. In 2012, fund investors poured $680bn into bond mutual funds and ETFs, while taking some $23bn out of equity funds. \n\n*         Given the recent vintage of these equity fund inflows, they are unlikely to reverse quickly as there is not a lot of profit on them yet. Near-term momentum thus remains good for stocks, in our view. At the same time, the more bullish sentiment on stocks is now sending a contrarian signal. Last year, we based much of our long equity recommendation on our impression that most market participants saw more downside risk across the globe than we thought would become realized. This does not appear to be the case anymore, as the main remaining market concern is only about Fiscal Cliff 2. No more talk of Chinese hard landing or a Greek exit. Hence, the case for being long risk assets is more value based, rather than the reversal in risk perceptions which we think has largely happened by now. We would therefore describe our remaining longs in equities and credit as modest and medium term. \n\n*\t \n\n*         We could again be induced to move our equity overweight to an “aggressive” level, if there were to be reason to raise growth and earnings projections. All we have so far is improved forward looking indicators – largely PMIs and positive feedback from asset markets – that are signaling a pickup in growth this quarter. But so far, this is simply confirming our and consensus views on how the year is set to start. They are not allowing us yet to upgrade our global growth expectations (Chart on right). \n\n*         More ominously, the continued strong rallies in risk markets to new highs for the cycle are hiding the fact that recent hard data on Q4 activity have again forced us to lower our estimate of Q4 global GDP growth, now to 1.7%, largely due to the US and Europe. The average global growth pace of the past 3 months has fallen to only 1.8%, barely more than half of trend. The expectation remains that Q1 should come in at 2.4% as both Japan and the Euro area exit recession. \n\n*         While staying overall long risk markets, both credit and equities at the moment, we have increasingly focused on tactical cross-market exposures, and in particular the underweight of US equities. In GMOS this week, we took profit on the overweight of Euro area equities against the US given the still very weak economy, with Q4 likely now the biggest GDP decline since the end of the global recession (We do stay overweight Euro periphery bond). But we remain aggressively overweight both Japan and EM Asia versus the US, with Japan currency hedged. The upside surprise on Chinese CPI today dented its equity market somewhat, but we think this will be temporary as it should not yet lead to monetary tightening. The recent set of strong trade and industrial data from China and the region are signaling to us significant upside risk on Q1 and 2013 growth projections. \n\n*         We have been long Japanese equities since Nov 16, which more by luck than skill defined the beginning of its equity rally. Topix is up 20% since then, almost straight line. We believe new PM Abe conviction and political power to reflate the economy are real. It has already helped the yen lose 10% versus the dollar. Given this move, faster fiscal easing and support from equities, we have raised our 2013 growth forecast for a 3rd time, this time to 0.8%. We stay long the Japanese reflation trade. \n\nFixed Income \n\n*         Bonds recovered some of their losses from last week, but remain down on the year. We do not see the current surge in equities as a negative for bonds, yet, as equity inflows are not coming out of bond funds, and growth remains too weak to elicit an early end to QE. With USTs very much at the top of their 6-month trading range, we go tactically long duration, but would take profit soon on a decent rally. In the Euro are, in contrast, the continued flow into the periphery should remain negative for Bund and euro swaps. We retain a bearish bias here. \n\nEquities \n\n*         Equities are up again this week, helped by rapidly improving equity ETF inflows. Strong buying by retail investors is adding fuel to equity markets against a backdrop of rather subdued macro drivers, maintaining a positive-near term momentum. The reporting season is also helping with US companies beating so far by 2% the bottom up analysts’ estimates at the beginning of the year. \n\n*         Our recommended equity portfolio focuses on regional and sectoral exposures. Underweighting US equities remains our main regional theme. This trade also protects our portfolio against looming debt ceiling risks. US equities had been the consensus overweight by equity investors for two years and their outperformance started reversing over the summer. US equities have so far erased their 2012 outperformance but are far from erasing their 2011 outperformance. \n\n*         We focus the US equity underweight against EM Asia and Japan. In GMOS this week, we took profit on our overweight in MSCI EMU versus S&P500 given looming Italian election risks into February, and still disappointing European economic activity data. We stay overweight in Topix vs. S&P500 currency hedged. Fiscal easing, financed via debt monetization, and coupled with structural reforms has the potential to sustain this trade beyond a 3-6 month horizon, in our view. This week’s fiscal stimulus announced by the Japanese gov’t appears supportive of the Japanese trade. \n\n*         Across sectors we favor Cyclical vs. Defensive sectors but have taken part profit as the pace of the improvement in the global manufacturing PMI slowed in December. We stay overweight the DJ US Home Construction Index and large mortgage banks (BKX Index) vs. the S&P500 to position for a continued recovery in US housing. \n\nCredit \n\n*         High-grade spreads and yields were a few bps tighter this week, although US and European high-yield continued to rally strongly. Double-digit spread tightening sent both to new all-time yield lows; now just 5.9% in the US and 6.5% in Europe. The clear outlier this week was EMBIG, the ill health of the Venezuelan president and a NY court ruling in favor of hold-out creditors in Argentina’s ‘pari passu’ saga helped push spreads up 12bp. We believe such idiosyncrasies driving relative performance signals an uncharacteristic break-down in spread correlations and a welcome move-away from the one-factor-drives-all world of late. \n\n*         The strength of equity flows has caught our attention this week, but there is little evidence of a wider rotation out of bonds. There has indeed been some evidence of bond into equity fund flows in ETFs (best seen through our flow radars in Flows & Liquidity), but bond mutual funds continue to see inflows, which accelerated this week. Also, our client survey reports on-going demand for credit and new issues remain well bid (see CMOS and F&L for more details). \n\nForeign Exchange \n\n*         2013 has started with bubbling optimism across global markets. Equities are approaching five-year highs and credit spreads their five-year lows, while government bonds are selling off worldwide and inflation breakevens behave (outside the UK). And per the traditional pattern, the dollar is falling versus most currencies, except those which entered 2013 with enormous liabilities – the yen given Japan’s full-throated commitment to looser monetary and fiscal policy, and the rand on sovereign credit and balance of payment concerns. EUR/USD has spiked since Thursday’s ECB meeting but is underperforming much of the commodity complex (MXN, CLP, AUD, NZD) year-to-date, highlighting that China's data surprises this week count for as much as a less-worried ECB. \n\n*         These country-specific issues are more powerful than systemic ones for the moment, which is likely why correlations across dollar-based pairs have sunk to three-year lows. The yen story still looks to us the most unique – USD/JPY is the only major asset globally where vols are up this year – and the one with broader consequences for neighbors (through EM Asian intervention policy). Hence, this week's focus in our FX Markets Weekly on two other dimensions of the bearish yen view: what is the currency worth if the BoJ successfully delivers 2% inflation, and how broad is the yen short. \n\n*         To those who believe in purchasing power parity (and we are not amongst them), USD/JPY could move to 100 on a credible BoJ. Realizing these extreme targets requires Japanese participation in this yen move, since international investors could reach their risk limits on yen shorts. So far domestics look fairly unconvinced. Japan has been posting net capital outflows (foreign purchases of JGBs minus Japanese purchases of foreign bonds) since mid-2011, but the pace of those outflows has not increased since then-candidate Shinzo Abe began calling for much looser monetary policy. Stay short yen on the possibility that locals join the move, but rotate exposure. Book gains on a KRW/JPY one-touch, a USD/JPY seagull and CHF/JPY cash. Stay long NOK/JPY and re-enter EUR/JPY (both in cash). Stay short USD vs a basket of AUD, RUB and KRW. \n\nCommodities \n\n*         Commodities are up around 1% this week, with all sectors gaining ground. In Wednesday’s GMOS, we retained all our previous positions. Our main trades are long Brent time spreads (long front vs. third futures contract), long industrial metals, long US natural gas and short agriculture. Production losses in the North Sea should support our Brent trade, while the current economic rebound in China should push industrial metals higher. US Natural gas should benefit from the ongoing switch from coal to gas for power generation and 2013 should see the first slowdown in production since the boom began five years ago. \n\n*         The GSCI agriculture index has already reversed around 80% of its rise in summer 2012 as farmers have planted a much larger area, which means a higher likelihood of much higher future supply. We stay short for now as we think this downtrend has further to go. We are also long gasoil vs. Brent. Global inventories are very low and demand from Asia is picking up, consistent with the economic data, which we expect to improve further over the coming months. An expected cold snap should also help push demand higher through January \n\n*         We took profit on our long position in gold last Friday and year-to-date gold is down around 1%. We believe many investors had bought gold over the past few years to hedge against the risk of “QE unlimited.” The recent FOMC minutes, however, have since raised the risk of an early end to QE, reducing to need to hedge through gold. The risk is thus that a number of market participants will reduce their gold hedges, pushing gold prices down further. We still like gold as a hedge against long-term inflation risks once global growth returns to trend and we would look to reopen the position at around $1,550/oz.. \n\n\nJan Loeys <http://emaillink.jpmorgan.com/t/AQ/AAGO5g/AAMcAQ/OFFmSw/EGA/ABQygw/AQ/NO6w>  \n(1-212) 834-5874 \njan.loeys@jpmorgan.com <mailto:jan.loeys@jpmorgan.com>  \n\nJohn Normand <http://emaillink.jpmorgan.com/t/AQ/AAGO5g/AAMcAQ/OFFmSw/EGA/ABRcsg/AQ/ubtX>  \n(44-20) 7134-1816 \njohn.normand@jpmorgan.com <mailto:john.normand@jpmorgan.com>  \n\nNikolaos Panigirtzoglou <http://emaillink.jpmorgan.com/t/AQ/AAGO5g/AAMcAQ/OFFmSw/EGA/ABRcsw/AQ/bEC9>  \n(44-20) 7134-7815 \nnikolaos.panigirtzoglou@jpmorgan.com <mailto:nikolaos.panigirtzoglou@jpmorgan.com>  \n\nSeamus Mac Gorain <http://emaillink.jpmorgan.com/t/AQ/AAGO5g/AAMcAQ/OFFmSw/EGA/ABRctA/AQ/yXTe>  \n(44-20) 7134-7761 \nseamus.macgorain@jpmorgan.com <mailto:seamus.macgorain@jpmorgan.com>  \n\nMatthew Lehmann <http://emaillink.jpmorgan.com/t/AQ/AAGO5g/AAMcAQ/OFFmSw/EGA/ABRctQ/AQ/n6n2>  \n(44-20) 7134-7813 \nmatthew.m.lehmann@jpmorgan.com <mailto:matthew.m.lehmann@jpmorgan.com>  \n\nLeo Evans <http://emaillink.jpmorgan.com/t/AQ/AAGO5g/AAMcAQ/OFFmSw/EGA/ABRctg/AQ/6D8N>  \n(44-20) 7742-2537 \nleonard.a.evans@jpmorgan.com <mailto:leonard.a.evans@jpmorgan.com>  \n\nIf you no longer wish to receive these e-mails then click here to unsubscribe <http://emaillink.jpmorgan.com/t/AQ/AAGO5g/AAMcAQ/OFFmSw/EGA/A2E/AQ/HQED>  \n\nwww.jpmorganmarkets.com <http://emaillink.jpmorgan.com/t/AQ/AAGO5g/AAMcAQ/OFFmSw/EGA/ABPpLw/AQ/OT0F>  \n\n________________________________\n\n \n\nAnalyst certification: I certify that: (1) all of the views expressed in this research accurately reflect my personal views about any and all of the subject securities or issuers; and (2) no part of my compensation was, is, or will be directly or indirectly related to the specific recommendations or views expressed herein.

The system\nbuilt under Vladimir Putin is defined by the following\ncharacteristics:\n\n1. Control over the commanding heights of the\nmedia: Among Putin's first goals as president\nwas securing domination of the most influential\nmedia—the national television stations. They\nhad been controlled by various oligarchs, who\nused the outlets to promote their personal and\npolitical interests. While the resulting journalism\nwas hardly objective and independent, Russian\ntelevision and Russian media generally were no-\ntable for their liveliness and diversity during the\npresidency of Boris Yeltsin. All did not sing out\nof the same hymnal, and most influential outlets\nreflected a variety of opinions about government\npolicies, including the Kremlin's conduct of the\nwar in Chechnya.\n\nPutin moved quickly to change these conditions.\nHe reorganized and exerted tighter political con-\ntrol over state-owned television stations, brought\nothers under indirect state control, and ensured\nthat most of the remainder fell into the hands\n\nof loyal businessmen. Likewise, a number of the\ncountn/’s leading newspapers and journals were\nbought by cronies of the leadership. The era of\nmedia diversity came to an abrupt end.’\n\n2. Distortion of coverage on sensitive topics: Un-\nlike in communist times, the media do provide\nindependent coverage of topics that the Kremlin\nconsiders less politically relevant. However,\nsome normally apolitical topics can take ona\nhighly political meaning. For example, coverage\nof the penalties meted out to Russian Olympic\nathletes for systematic doping reflected the\nleadership's position that the scandal was a\nproduct of American machinations.’\n\n3. Shrinking gap between offline and online me-\ndia: For much of Putin's tenure, the internet\n\nremained lightly regulated in comparison with\nthe Kremlin's tight control over television and\nother mass media. However, Freedom House\nhas noted growing restrictions over the past\nseveral years, with a series of new laws, prosecu-\ntions, and ownership changes that have reduced\nthe Russian internet's freedom and diversity in\npractice.’\n\n. Asmall stable of independent outlets: A token\n\nnumber of media outlets are allowed to remain\nindependent at the sufferance of the Kremlin.\nThese include the newspaper Novaya Gazeta,\nthe indirectly state-owned radio station Ekho\nMoskvy, and a handful of internet-based news\nservices, some of which are forced to operate\nfrom neighboring countries. Coerced owner-\nship changes and other forms of pressure have\ngradually reduced the already tiny independent\nmedia sector in recent years. And the remaining\nindependent outlets have little reach, small audi-\nences, and at best modest impact on domestic\npolitics.\n\n. The ‘weaponization’ of information: While Putin\n\nhas used the press as a propaganda instrument\nthroughout his political career, it was after his\nthird term as president began in 2012 that the\nmedia were given a special, central role in de-\nmonizing Putin's critics, preparing the Russian\npeople for armed conflict in Ukraine and else-\nwhere, depicting Europe as morally corrupt, and\nattributing Russia's problems and setbacks to\nthe United States.* With the invasion of Ukraine\nin 2014, the world awakened to the return of\npropaganda as an instrument of warfare. This is\nnot just normal political spin or public diploma-\ncy, but sheer, raw propaganda that celiberately\ncrosses the line between interpretation of facts\nand outright mendacity. The aim is both to stir\nup belligerence at home and to isolate, confuse,\nand demoralize the enemy.°\n\n. The centralization of information policy: The\n\ncreation in 2013 of Rossiya Segodnya, an umbrel-\nla organization for Moscow's foreign news ser-\nvices, signaled the leadership's intention to use\ninformation in a more strategic way to advance\nthe country’s international objectives. Dmitry\nKiselyov, a controversial television presenter,\nwas named to head the new entity.® He actually\nembraces his identity as the Kremlin's chief\npropagandist, arguing that “Western” concepts\n\n16\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_019250\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

The\nFund Managers believe that opportunities with these characteristics offer important benefits to\nall market participants in the biopharmaceuticals sector, and that these substantially de-risk the\nR&D and commercial sides of the biopharmaceutical business model in ways that can\nmeaningfully benefit investors.\n\nPatients are offered therapies that are more targeted to their disease, and benefit from\nimprovements in efficacy and safety through increased life expectancy, improved quality of life,\nand a more rapid return to a fully productive life;\n\nPhysicians have access to an arsenal of products that they can choose from to tailor therapy to\nspecific patients’ disease, and avoid the costs and risks associated with using less effective\ntherapies that carry all the safety risks, but may or may not have any effect on the specific\ndisease subtype of an individual patient;\n\nPayers may pay higher prices for these therapies, but with the enhanced efficacy and safety\nprofile that’s possible with biomarker based targeting, they can expect to see better overall\npatient outcomes, that ultimately save money within the system;\n\nPharmaceutical Companies benefit because with targeted approaches to drug discovery and\n\ndevelopment, the probabilities of success improve, interactions with regulators become less\nrisky, timelines to move products from the lab to the market can be significantly shortened, and\n\n35 CONTROL NUMBER 257 - CONFIDENTIAL\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_024046\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

Enron, which in 2001 filed one of the largest bankruptcies in U.S. history, hid\nbillions of dollars in debt in hundreds of shell firms, which bought poorly performing Enron\nstocks so that Enron could create a fraudulent company profile and mislead its auditors. Lehman\nBrothers, in the years before its 2008 collapse, used a smaller firm called Hudson Castle (of\nwhich it owned 25 percent) to shift risky investments off its books so that Hudson Castle, not\nLehman Brothers, could absorb “headline risk.” Which leads us to shaming’s third weakness.\n\n(3.) Shaming’s biggest drawback is its insufficiency. Some people have no shame. In the\nresearch my colleagues and I have conducted on first-year students, involving games that require\ncooperation, we have found that shame does not encourage cooperation among those players\nwho are least cooperative. This suggests that a certain fraction of a given population will always\nbehave shamelessly, like the False cleanerfish, if the payoff is high enough. The banks may have\ngone bankrupt, but the bankers got their bonuses. There was even speculation that publishing\nindividual banker bonuses would lead to banker jealousy, not shame.\n\nMy colleagues and I conclude that ultimately shame is not enough to catalyze major\nsocial change. Slavery did not end because abolitionists shamed slave owners into freeing their\nslaves. Child labor did not stop because factories were shamed into forbidding children to work.\nDestruction of the ozone layer did not slow because industries were ashamed to manufacture\nproducts that contained chlorofluorocarbons. This is why punishment remains imperative. Even\nif shaming were enough to bring the behavior of most people into line, governments need a\nsystem of punishment to protect the group from the least cooperative players.\n\nFinally, consider who belongs to the group. Today we are faced with the additional\n\nchallenge of balancing human interests and the interests of nonhuman life. How can we\n\n10\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_023729\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

We both fell asleep\non the long ride and when we woke up to the sound of the buses brakes\ncoming to a halt we initially realized my purse and Robbie’s wallet with\nall of our money and cards in it was missing. Stranded in the city of\nBangkok was frightening enough as it was but too make matters worse a\nlady looking in her mid-seventies, scrawny and hunched over from an\nobvious lack of nutrition lifted up her skirt to a passer-byer with a she-\nmale hanging off his arm and began smacking her vagina blaring out\n“Look! No cock...Pussy, pussy! Only five baht” repeating herself many\ntimes over the man just walked on past as she sat back down on the curb\nwaiting for the next alluring customer. Robbie and I shook our heads in\ndisgust and disbelief, things could really be that bad for someone, | would\nknow best as it wasn’t far off the life Jeffrey had been training me up for.\n\nCompletely broke at two o’clock in the morning and with no one to call\nfor help, I panicked right away. Robbie rubbed my back and his tired eyes\ntrying to make the situation better. Luckily we had made friends with\nsome really nice people from the resort on the island who gave us about\ntwo thousand baht when they saw how devastated Robbie and I were.\nWith just enough money to rent a really. cheap room for the night at a\nbackpackers hoste! and pay for a taxi to the airport the following day, we\nwere saved.\n\nEarly the next morning we were off in separate planes, since Robbie’s\nticket was pre-booked and no available seats left for me to join him meant\nwe would be landing in Australia separately. Fortunately we had found a\ncorresponding flight that arrived within the same hour of each other but I\nwould have to make a stop over to the Philippines. The lengthy hours of\nthe duration on the flight seemed to stretch on with only the thoughts of\nthe journey ahead of me I couldn’t wait to get back to my husbands\nloving arms. The trip was going well, sleeping the majority of the flight\nuntil I had to change planes in the Philippines.\n\nAfter the plane landed and before any passenger was allowed to get off\nwe were handed a declaration statement that informed us that if we were\ncarrying any drugs or weaponry, we would be arrested and face charges\nwith death as the ultimate penalty. Not that I had anything to worry about,\nbut what a thought to willingly sign over your life. I got the chills\nhanding over my signed declaration and traveling documents to the\ncustoms officer. Obtaining my passport he additionally asked to see my\ndeparting ticket. No problem | thought, just I had done many of times,\nand | handed over the requested information. The officer looked me over\n\n133\n\n£1 Copyright Protected Material\nCONFIDENTIAL GIUFFRE004266\n\nand got on the phone immediately which sounded like a phone call to his\nsuperiors but | couldn’t tell since it was in another language. A brief\nconversation but long enough to get me thinking, he then called over two\nguards who took me by the arms and brought me into an empty room but\nfor a desk and three chairs to be interrogated. No one would tell me what\nwas going on they all just scattered around in frenzy, ignoring all of my\nhysterical inquisitions. Leaving me by myself and alone with my thoughts\nI couldn’t help but panic even worse now.\n\nThis was a total bombshell of confusion on my part, what had | done\nwrong? Minute’s later a large-framed women in a green uniform entered\nthe room with the guards from before and sat down across from me with\na stern look in her eyes. She placed my documents on the desk in between\nus. Not saying a word to me she was waiting for me to give her an\nexplanation for something. “Can you please tell me what this is about,\nhave I done something wrong?” L asked her politely, trying to restraint\nany animosity towards her. Her reply sounded as grim as she looked.\n“You have been in Thailand for three months and now you have only a\none way ticket booked to Australia with no visa. What exactly are your\nplans once you get there, Ms. Roberts?” To myself 1 wondered what\nbusiness it was to her, don’t people travel with one-way tickets all the\ntime? Knowing I was in no position to be able to say anything like that or\neven at all I just gave in nicely and told her my intentions to travel over\nthere. Crying through my entire explanation | wasn’t sure if | was going ~\nto even make my flight now. She had to think about everything | had told\nher fora moment, deciding whether or not she would grant me\npermission to meet my husband in Australia or send me back alone to\nBangkok. With only time on my side she had to make a hasty verdict\nnow. One more question had to be answered before | was let go, she\nwanted some proof. “If you have just got married can you show me your\nmarriage certificate then?” This didn’t help my stories credibility at all\nseeing that we were married in a Buddhist temple and given woven\nbracelets instead of certificates. Explaining to her that I didn’t have one to\nshow her yet but was already aware that I would have to obtain a legal\nmarriage certificate through a courthouse upon my arrival in Australia to\nstay there legally, it was only because of my husbands beliefs we wanted\nto get married in a Buddhist ceremony. She must have shared a common\ninterest in religion or something like that as she finally cracked a smile\nupon the photos of the wedding day that 1 showed her and carrying in my\npurse since getting them developed, if she wanted proof, well this is all I\nreally had.\n\nHanding me back my documents and ticket I was now free to leave but\nshe wasn’t leaving me much time to run through the airports terminal to\nget to my departing plane.

The focus was, of all things, on defense against a\nmissile attack from Iran. I contacted Leon Panetta to see whether we could delay it.\nThe official reason cited by the Americans, when they agreed to do it, did have the\nmerit of being true: that Bibi was coming under pressure to shift our budgetary\npriorities away from defense toward social and economic issues. But Panetta\nunderstood that my request for a delay meant we were at least considering military\naction. He also realized that if we did launch an attack, it was in the Americans’\nown interest for their troops be as far away from Israel as possible. We agreed to\nreschedule the exercise for October 2012. That meant that if we did decide to\nattack, we’d have until well into September, when significant numbers of US\ntroops would begin arriving.\n\nAs we weighed our final decision, I held a series of high-level meetings in\nWashington: with Panetta, national security adviser Tom Donilon, Hillary Clinton,\nand President Obama himself. Though not explicitly saying we were ready to\nattack, I left no doubt that we were seriously considering it, and explained the\nreasons we believed our country’s fundamental security interests might make it\nnecessary. The message from all of the Americans I met was that the\nadministration shared our basic goal: to prevent, or at least seriously impair, Iran’s\ndrive to get a nuclear bomb. But they continued to believe that non-military\npressure was the best way to do it.\n\nThe Americans knew we were skeptical that the non-military route would work,\nand that we were deeply worried about the implications of not taking military\naction if it failed. I discussed our thinking — and, in general terms, our plans — in\nmy meetings with Panetta. He already had a pretty good idea of the broad contours\nof what we were contemplating, since US radar systems and electronic intercepts\nhad been recording the volume and nature of air force exercises we’d been\nconducting over recent months. Leon and I had by now got to know each other\nwell, having first met when he was in charge of the CIA at the start of the Obama\nadministration. In one of our early meetings at CIA headquarters in Langley, there\nhad been a small bunch of grapes on his desk and I plucked a few in my mouth\nwith obvious enjoyment. Now, at the Pentagon, he had a big bowlful ready\nwhenever we met. The fact that he opposed an Israeli military operation made him\nno less of a pleasure to deal with.

The Lyon’s Den, a popular New York gossip\ncolumn, carried the following vignette: [C] He was close to each clerk in a different way,\nfollowing our careers, advising us on life choices and encouraging us to “do great things.”\n\nThree months after I started working for Justice Goldberg I was in his secretary’s office while she\nwas talking on the phone to her husband who was an officer in the U.S. armed forces. I think he\nhad something to do with communications, because he told her that shots had been fired in Dallas.\nWe turned on a small television set that had been in my cubicle ever since the World Series a\ncouple of months earlier. Nothing was yet on the news. A few minutes later everyone in the\nworld knew that President Kennedy had been shot. It was a Friday morning and the nine Justices\nof the Supreme Court were in their weekly private conference, which no one, except for the\nJustices, was allowed to attend. There were no secretary, clerks or messengers. I had been given\nstrict instructions never to interrupt Justice Goldberg during one of these conferences, but I knew\nthis was an exception. And so I went to the door of the private conference room and knocked.\nJustice Goldberg, being the junior Justice, answered the door and gave me a dirty look, saying, “I\ntold you not to interrupt me.” I said, “Mr. Justice, you are going to want to know that the\nPresident has been shot.” Several of the Justices immediately gathered around my little television\nset which, it turned out, was the only one in the entire Supreme Court building. We watched, as\nthe news got progressively worse, finally leading to the announcement that the President was\ndead. The Chief Justice asked all of the Justices to disperse for fear that there might be a\nconspiracy involving attacks on other institutions. The clerks stayed behind to finish the court’s\nbusiness.\n\nThe following night, right after the Sabbath was over, Justice Goldberg asked me to pick him up\nand drive him to the White House. He was closely connected both to the Kennedy family and to\nLyndon Johnson, and the new President wanted his advice. I picked up the Justice in my old\nPeugeot, which was filled with children’s toys. I drove him to the White House gate. Goldberg\nasked me to wait for him, since the meeting would be relatively brief, and drive him home. When\nthe White House guard looked into the car, he immediately flung the back door open and grabbed\na toy plastic gun. Nerves were pretty tense. He wouldn’t let me wait inside the White House\ngate, so I had to wait outside until the Justice returned. I also drove him to the funeral and was\nwith him when the news came over the radio that Lee Harvey Oswald had been shot. Goldberg\nexclaimed angrily, “What kind of a country are we living in!”\n\nShortly thereafter, Chief Justice Earl Warren told the Supreme Court staff and employees that he\nwas becoming Chairman of the newly formed Warren Commission. I asked Goldberg why he\nwould do that. Goldberg told me something, which only in retrospect became clear. He said that\nthe President had asked him to perform a patriotic duty and to convince the American public that\nthe act was that of a lone gunman, and not a conspiracy by the communists. Warren agreed\nbecause he did not want to allow any excuses either for a return of McCarthyism or for military\nhostilities between the Soviet Union and the United States. I later learned that Lyndon Johnson\npersonally believed that there was a conspiracy behind the Kennedy assassination, but handpicked\nthe Warren Commission to assure that even if the evidence pointed in that direction, it would be\ncovered up in the interest of national security.\n\n65\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_017152\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

So with networks. We will get\nto know their nature by learning to use them. By watching what they do, observing\nthem in their surprising movements. We know at least already that puzzles like the\nfuture of US-China relations or income inequality or artificial intelligence are simply\nnot addressable with traditional thinking because they occur on a network surface\nnow. Old-style ideas about each of these will likely lead us down dangerous paths.\nOur leaders today are, as a result, imperiling us in ways they can’t even understand.\nHonestly, these figures are not mentally prepared to fight any sort of battle on this\nlandscape. They probably never will be.\n\nI’m not saying effective leadership now demands you know what “the instantiation\nof a class” in object oriented programming means - or that you master the technical\nroots of some other crucial, philosophical idea of connective design. But a feeling for\nthe laws of networks, for the normalness of connection and the pressures that it\nproduces is essential at least.

They\nand their doings had made her entire world. And now she was going off, alone, toa\nsingle room at Richmond.”?° The people now lamenting the decline of television, of\nnewspapers, of a disconnected age, who are baffled by constant connection or apps\nof the moment or machines that learn should be given their quiet moments with the\nold structures. They knew that world from their knees, built and maintained it as\nmuch for us as for them.

And I did try\ntalking to Mr. Ambition again, and he acknowledged that he hadn't exactly intended to\nbreak up with me.\n\nBut then Mr. Ambition and I had several of those encounters that I think of as \"post-\nbreakup talks.\" I hate that shit. Every evening ended on a confusing, inconclusive note.\nHe kept saying that he was \"confidently ambiguous.\" We weren't dating, we weren't not\ndating.

Assistant directors ask for volunteers to dance to the live\nmusic. Prince Dimitri twirls and dips Jackie Weld. Kelly Klein, in her own Karl Lagerfeld sheer black organza,\nwatches from a table with scattered champagne glasses half-filled with apple juice along with her 86-year-old\nfather, Tulley Rector. Charlie Sheen leaves for LA and Shia is very annoyed he was not introduced to his\nhero. Carrie Mulligan, costumed like Audrey Hepburn, chats with us between takes.\n\nThe final set up is a long tracking shot of Josh Brolin and his wife as they triumphantly enter the ball. It is\nclose to 9 p.m. and Lord William Astor arrives to pick me up for Amalia Dayan and Adam Lindemann's dinner\nfor artists uptown.\n\nOliver is introduced to William and delights in calling him Lord as he immediately moves him into the top of\nthe shot and instructs him to tell Eli Wallach, \"We must do lunch\". Ever the proper English gentleman,\nWilliam advises Oliver that Lords do not use American slang and improvises his own lines. The tracking shot\ncontinues for numerous takes following Josh and Noelle as every VIP extra gets another shot at instant stardom\nwith one-line greetings.\n\nAt last, “It’s a wrap” is screamed after 10 p.m. Prince Dimitri tells The Wall Street Journal it was, \"a day of\nelectrifying glamour,\" and “the longest gala of my life. I was in black tie for thirteen hours.”\n\nNovember 25, Tommy Gun Salon, Ludlow Street, last day of shooting\n\nDonald Trump is on set at 7 a.m. ready for his close up.

Back in\nSeptember, Oliver had invited Donald Trump to dinner at \"21\" to meet his leading men Josh and Shia so they\ncould observe New York's most charismatic powerbroker in his natural environment.\n\nThe scene is London so the grey skies are perfect. Gekko has moved abroad to make his financial\n\ncomeback. The scene opens on the back of his head in a barber's chair as he watches the financial news on TV.\nThe camera pulls back and Gordon Gekko is finally revealed as the powerful bull he once was in an exquisite\nsuit and signature slicked-back hair. Donald Trump walks into the shop for a cut and the banter begins about\nthe money market. From his chair, Donald leans into Michael and suggests a \"comb over\" like his famous\n\ndo. Gekko, with a slight grin, says, \"No thanks Donald, I am a gel man.”\n\nThe crew is yucking it up and Donald feels great. Paparazzi shoot the whole scene with long lenses from across\nthe street. The unit publicist is helpless to keep this under wraps. Donald emerges, poses and gives interviews.\nMichael comes out, and the press think they have a scoop on the ending. Gekko is back in all his lovable titan\nsplendor. Full-page photos of Michael and Donald run the next day in the tabloids. Never underestimate Oliver\nStone’s surprise endings.\n\nTwentieth Century Fox releases \"Wall Street 2: The Money Never Sleeps\" on April 23rd and it's got hit written\nall over it.\n\nDe ee ee eee ee i ee ee ee i ee a\n\nThe information contained in this communication is\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_021239\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

Even, | think, by people who are reading this\nbook.\n\nWhy start this journey into the churning, still-confusing and affronting world\naround us now by the shores of Lake Taihu? Why begin with the sentiments of a\nslower culture that Master Nan embodied, passed like delicate and still-warm tea,\nwith so much calm in the face of all this urgency? It’s not only because of Master\nNan’s insight that this world is tearing at our minds, that the faster we move the\nsicker we'll get. It’s something else. The training of an instinct, of a really fresh way\nof looking at the world, demands a kind of calm. Understanding of anything, after all,\nis most durably assembled in slow conversations, in patient probing. It is developed\nas much from brushes with music and literature as it is from any direct, slamming\nconfrontation with the truth. The birth of an instinct requires a rewiring of our\nminds, a reframing of our hopes, and this can only be done at the pace of\ncontemplation. (It’s the best way to keep the fear at bay.) We seek those stilled,\nfreeze-framed moments where we'll pause amid lightspeed fast networks to think\nabout why they work and just what they are doing to us. Tranquility, fora moment\nat least, in the face of the alternately horrible and wonderful way the world is being\nremade. That’s what you'll get here, in the following pages. Nan’s model statesman\nSu Qin, knife stabbed into his own thigh and slouched with exhaustion is a sort of\ntotem for us. Knife in thigh. Stop. Think. Even, hard as it may be, wait for the right\npath to present itself. No matter how uncomfortable it may be at times, it is better to\nbe unconventional than conventional in our revolutionary age. This is the only way\nto cultivate a Seventh Sense. The old methods will not teach you a new way.\n\nLet me tell you what is going to happen: In coming years there will be a struggle\nbetween those who have the Seventh Sense - who are born with it or trained to it -\nand those who don't. New, network forces all around us will take on old, established\nones - they already are - in business, politics, warfare, science. Then - because\nthose who don’t have the Seventh Sense for network power will lose, as anyone who\ntries to stop the future always loses - a new age will begin. This age will involve\nviolent, historic wrestling between different groups with different versions of the\nSeventh Sense.Competing interests and ideals and aims will fire these contending\nforces. Networks will fight networks. Some of the plans of these connected age\ngroups will be good, others evil, and anyhow the winners will be ruthless. Then, and\nthis is where it will get particularly strange and incredible, there will be a battle\nbetween those with the Seventh Sense and the very systems of connection,\nmachines and intelligence they have built.

On this\nview, those who engage in certain kinds of crimes, such as child molesters and rapists, are more likely to\nrepeat because it is “in” their system. Unfortunately, both folk perception and legal analysis of future\ndangerousness are based on weak evidence, unfounded assumptions, or both.\n\nConsider sexual offenders. Their crime is intentional, frequently repeated, and aimed at innocent\nvictims. Given that many sexual offenders repeat their offenses, it has the appearance of inevitability, of\na process that is highly determined. Because many sexual offenders were abused as children, some\nexperts conclude that we should blame their parents. Other experts believe that particular situations either\npromote or support sexual offenders, including the church and medical exam rooms. And yet other\nexperts, including the psychiatrist Boris Schiffer, reveal brain differences among pedophiles, including\nespecially the areas involved in reward and self-control. Together, these observations suggest that the\ncombination of a deviant nature and toxic nurture have led to a more deterministic universe. In this\nuniverse, sexual offenses are inevitable or so highly probable that we should lock up offenders and post\ntheir crimes in every county’s registry, and if possible, as replacements for flamingo lawn art.\n\nIf this assessment of sexual offenders is right, how should we think about responsibility, blame,\nand punishment. If sexual offenders can’t help themselves, how should we assign blame? How should we\nassign an appropriate level and form of punishment, if punishment is even appropriate? Studies of\nrecidivism among sexual offenders generate rates as low as 15% and as high as 80%. These studies also\nreveal that recidivism rates differ for incest perpetrators, rapists, and child molesters. These numbers tell\nus that even child molesters don’t always repeat their crimes. They also tell us that sexual offences should\nnot be lumped, but split apart into their underlying causes and triggers. Like the high odds favoring a\nhorse with a distinguished lineage and top rated jockey, there are high odds favoring repeated sexual\nmolestation in an individual who was sexually abused as a child and enters the clergy. Does this mean\nthat we should all bet on this one horse or forget the race altogether? Does this mean that we should lock\nup the priest before he has an opportunity to enter his parish? No and No. Neither horse racing nor sexual\nmolestation are that easily determined. Future success and future dangerousness are probabilistic. They\nrepresent our best guesses. When the law determines that someone is at high risk of committing a future\noffense, it doesn’t really care whether the individual is perfectly healthy or brain damaged. It cares about\nrisk. In terms of blame and punishment, however, the law cares about the perpetrator’s brain. The law\ncares about a person’s capacity to act rationally and independently. It is this capacity that allows us to\nassign responsibility. It is this capacity that drives many theories of blame and punishment, including the\nAustralian legal scholar Michael Moore’s massive treatise Placing Blame. These are reasons why\nscientific understanding of future dangerousness is important for law and society.\n\nArmed with these ideas about future dangerousness, we can return to the list of potential evildoers\nthat I mentioned in the prologue. This list included individuals who caused relatively minor harms such as\nReverend Lawrence Murphy and Charles Manson, as well as those who committed much more major\nharms such as Idi Amin and Mao Zedong. Whether we consider these individuals and their acts as evil is\northogonal to the fact that each one posed a great risk to society. Each of these individuals would have\nbeen judged as high risk for causing future danger. Only some of these individuals should have been\npunished if punishment is guided by our understanding of responsibility and blame. Only those\nindividuals who can take responsibility for their actions and change should be punished. On this view, all\nof the dictators were rightly blamed and punished. And so too were Jane Toppan, Bernard Madoff, and\nCharles Granger. In contrast, although Lawrence Murphy should have been locked up as opposed to\nexiled to a cottage, both Murphy and Charles Manson are more difficult to assess in terms of\nresponsibility, and thus, the appropriateness of punishment. No one would want them walking the streets\ntoday, free to rape innocent children or create a cult of murderers. But for the law to evolve, we need\nbetter tools to evaluate the biological underpinnings of diminished capacity. These measures, still in the\nearly stages of development, will help refine our understanding of risk, guide our clinical interventions,\nand contribute to the construction of a safer society.\n\nAs we move forward, we must also recognize the rapidly changing landscape, and the future\ndangerousness of globalization, especially its capacity to breed evildoers.

Some, especially Middle Eastern\nmonarchies, are American allies. But others are hostile\nto democracy and regard the United States—and often\nthe EU—as adversaries. The lobbyists and spin masters\nthey employ are not located exclusively in the United\nStates. Authoritarians with the requisite means and\ninterests have hired representatives in London and\nBrussels as well as Washington and New York.\n\nLawyers and consultants often represent dictator-\nships indirectly, through state-owned enterprises. A\nnumber of China's state businesses have hired legal\nand political consultants in major democracies, as\nhave state energy corporations in oil-rich countries\nlike Azerbaijan, Venezuela, and Angola.\n\nBut authoritarian governments generally seek the\nassistance of global public relations companies in the\nwake of repressive crackdowns at home or acts of\naggression against neighbors. During Manafort’s rela-\ntively brief tenure with the Trump campaign, it emerged\nthat several American firms had been contracted to\ndiscourage Congress from criticizing the Yanukovych\ngovernment for its jailing of Yanukovych’s 2010 presi-\ndential campaign rival, Yuliya Tymoshenko. That effort\nfailed, as members of Congress and the American me-\ndia made Tymoshenko’ fate a crucial criterion in their\nassessment of Yanukovych’s record.’? Manafort had\nmore success in his earlier work to prepare Yanukovych\nfor his candidacy in 2010.

But there are certainly other ways of using the deduction rule, outside\nof the basic control strategies embodied in the inference MindAgents. By learning schemata in-\nvolving the Deduction schema, the system can learn special, context-specific rules for combining\ndeduction with concept-formation, association-formation and other cognitive processes. And as\nit gets smarter, it can then take these schemata involving the Deduction schema, and replace\nit with a new schema that eg. contains a context-appropriate deduction formula.\n\nEventually, to support cognitive schema learning, we will want to cast the hard-wired MindA-\ngents as cognitive schemata, so the system can see what is going on inside them. Pragmatically,\nwhat this requires is coding versions of the MindAgents in Combo (see Chapter 21 of Part 2)\nrather than C++, so they can be treated like any other cognitive schemata; or alternately, rep-\nresenting them as declarative Atoms in the Atomspace. Figure 18.1 illustrates the possibility of\nrepresenting the PLN deduction rule in the Atomspace rather than as a hard-wired procedure\ncoded in C++.\n\nBut even prior to this kind of fully cognitively transparent implementation, the system can\nstill reason about its use of different mind dynamics by considering each MindAgent as a virtual\nProcedure with a real SchemaNode attached to it. This can lead to some valuable learning, with\nthe obvious limitation that in this approach the system is thinking about its MindAgents as\nblack boxes rather than being equipped with full knowledge of their internals.\n\n18.3 Self-Modification via Supercompilation\n\nNow we turn to a very different form of advanced self-modification: supercompilation. Super-\ncompilation \"merely\" enables procedures to run much, much faster than they otherwise would.\nThis is in a sense weaker than self-modication methods that fundamentally create new algo-\nrithms, but it shouldn’t be underestimated. A 50x speedup in some cognitive process can enable\nthat process to give much smarter answers, which can then elicit different behaviors from the\nworld or from other cognitive processes, thus resulting in a qualitatively different overall cog-\nnitive dynamic.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_013235\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

The two\nmembers of our team who were the least pessimistic about Camp David’s outcome,\nShlomo Ben-Ami and Yossi Ginossar, also said they thought it was a good idea. It\nwas they who’d pressed me to go see Arafat for tea and sweets earlier in the\nsummit. But that meeting had produced not even a glimmer of negotiating\nflexibility from the Palestinian leader. Yossi had said at the time that it would help\nthe atmosphere, and pay dividends later on. But that hadn’t happened either.\n“Madam Secretary,” I told Madeleine, “eating more baklava with Arafat isn’t\ngoing to help. The situation is simple: he needs to answer whether he views the\nPresident’s proposal as a basis for going forward.”\n\nWhen Clinton returned, he promptly got back down to business: making one\nlast push to see whether a peace deal was possible. He phoned me around midnight\non the 24\" of July, a few hours after he’d arrived. He told me he had sent an even\nmore far-reaching package to Arafat, expanding on my proposals. Now, all of the\nouter Arab neighborhoods in East Jerusalem would come under Palestinian\nsovereignty, in addition to the Muslim and Christian quarters in the Old City. And\nArafat would be given “custodial sovereignty” over the Muslim holy sites on the\nTemple Mount. I didn’t object. Though it was further than I felt I could go, it was\nwithin the spirit of my “pocket deposit”. The same ground rules still applied: these\nwere American proposals, which the President was telling Arafat he would try to\ndeliver if he accepted them as a basis for serious negotiations. But when Clinton\nphoned me back, around 3:15 in the morning, it was to tell me that Arafat had\nagain said no.\n\nThe curtain had finally come down. What remained now was to clear up the set.\nI did meet Arafat once more, in a joint session with President Clinton, but only for\nclosing statements. The President and I spoke as much in sorrow and frustration as\nanger. Both of us said we thought an historic agreement had been within our grasp,\nand that far-reaching proposals had been tabled to make it possible. Arafat\nresponded with words both of us had heard before: effusive toward Clinton,\nrhapsodic about his “old partner” Rabin and fulsome in his ostensible commitment\nto keep trying for peace. But it was just words. We knew he was not willing even\nto talk about the kind of compromises a real, final peace would require.\n\nThe President’s remarks to the media were, by the standards of post-summit\ndiplomacy, unmistakably clear in making that point. He praised me and the Israeli\n\n371\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_011842\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

A24's \"Moonlight\" won best picture because voters went for content over style. The win was for it’s poetic take on the American ideals that the Academy values most and wants reflected globally. History was also made as \"Moonlight\" became the first Oscar winner with an all black cast and addressed the LGBTQ community. And, it was a beautiful film. \n\nBut on the other hand, Oscar voters were also dealing with a political and emotional crisis in the film industry. After two years of #OscarsSoWhite, they responded by nominating a record six African American actors, four African American producers and one African American director, Barry Jenkins, the fourth ever nominated in that category. Three films addressing race were nominated for best picture: “Fences,” “Hidden Figures” and “Moonlight.”\n\nLionsgate's \"La La Land\" was a joyous escape from months of simmering frustration and anger at Donald J. Trump, himself a creature of the entertainment industry. The charming and modern musical “La La” ‎danced its way to multiple awards from critics, at the PGA, the DGA, the BAFTA and the Venice Film Festival, a record seven Golden Globes, en route to an historic fourteen Academy Award nominations. Prognosticators predicted a \"La La” landslide. \n\nSo what happened? Days before the voting deadline, \"La La Land\" was tripped-up by a last-minute backlash against frivolity. Even in La La Land, these are serious times. \n\nBackstage at the Dolby Theater, star-struck nitwit accountant Brian Cullinan, oblivious to the fact that the Oscars are a sacred secular ceremony and distracted while tweeting a photo of Emma Stone, handed Warren Beatty the wrong envelope. Chaos—and headlines—ensued. Tweets, chaos and headlines? It was all too Trump for words. \n\nWhen I arrived at the Dolby Theater that night, I asked a dateless Andrew Garfield to take me onto the red carpet with him, to the chagrin of his publicist. But a security guard rejected me because my ticket was the wrong color. Andrew winked, laughed and disappeared. Undaunted, I went back to the curb to find another walker. As I stood at the limo drop-off, inconspicuous in a day-glow orange satin dress, Kelly Bush, a publicist I knew‎ from last year's \"The Revenant\" campaign, sidled over and said, \"There is going to be an upset. ‘Moonlight’ is winning.\"\n\nOn cue, “La La Land” producer Marc Platt arrived with the studs on his formal shirt popping off. As I nervously fiddled in his buttonholes, I blurted, \"Kelly Bush just said ‘Moonlight’ is winning.” Marc turned white. \n\nThe red carpet was a three lane highway. The speed lane was for the super stars, the middle for frantic handlers, and on the right was the schlepper lane for relatives and relative nobodies. Four security guards escorted me there. ‎By the time Marc and I met again at the end of the three prong red carpet, \"La La Land\" publicist and West Coast campaign queen Lisa Taback was furious I’d told the shaken producer his film might lose. I said, \"Kelly Bush said that, not me.\" But I felt terrible. \n\nSure enough, the “La La” landslide never happened. It did win a spectacular six Oscars before Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway walked to center stage for the best picture finale. \nI was now standing against the wall at the first row of the first balcony. Lionsgate publicists Julie Fontaine and Jennifer Peterson, both dressed in haute couture gowns and borrowed emeralds, anxiously insisted I join their good luck group hug as best picture was announced. Despite my faux pas, and my work on most of the year’s top films, including “Moonlight,” “Manchester by the Sea” and “Hidden Figures,” Oscar night I was in the “La La” camp due to my long friendship with it’s director Damien Chazelle.\n\nSo we three bejeweled broads were hugging tightly, when Faye broke Warren’s pregnant pause and screamed \"La La Land\". The girls cried, the “La La” producers ran to the stage and I was thinking about how to apologize to Marc Platt as he thanked his family. Then, the stage filled up with men in headsets. Producer Jordan Horowitz, the class act of the evening, grabbed the right card and calmly announced \"Moonlight. No Joke.\" ‎ Platt, Horowitz and their co-producer Fred Berger handed their Oscars to Moonlight director Barry Jenkins, and producers Jeremy Kleiner and Adele Romanski and left the stage as Mahershala Ali, the first Muslim actor to get the gold guy, joined the cast waving his historic Oscar. \n\nJulie and Jennifer ran to Soho House to oversee Lionsgate's victory party, where hundreds of confused well-wishers waited to celebrate the “La La” wins, including Emma Stone’s best actress, Justin Hurwitz’s best score, and Benj Pasek, Justin Paul and Justin Hurwitz’s best song for “City of Stars.” At 32, Damien Chazelle also made history as the youngest best director ever. Some, lacking any empathy for the winners and losers onstage, called this historic screw-up \"great live-television.” But standing in the balcony, alone and speechless, all I could think was, “How did I miss this?”\n\nI ran to the Governor's Ball, which is the next stop for winners on their busy night. They get their statues engraved there before they drop by their studio’s party, get photographed, Oscar in hand at Vanity Fair’s fete, wall-to-wall with celebrities, and then head to Guy Oseary's home high in Beverly Hills to rock-and-roll ‘till dawn.\n\nAt the entrance to the Governor's Ball, Warren Beatty walked up to me, still holding the two priceless envelopes as proof of his innocence. I asked him, \"What happened?\" \n\nHis phone rang. It was so noisy, he bent toward me to hear better. The phone was almost in my face and I heard Annette Benning asking where he was and saying, \"Warren, come home.\" ‎ Warren said, \"No. I have done nothing wrong.\" \n\nWarren's wonderful film, \"Rules Don't Apply\" received little Academy love, yet he was generous enough to show up. Now, fifty years after “Bonnie and Clyde,” he was in the Oscar spotlight again, the latest unwitting star of Oscar’s all-time blooper reel. As Jimmy Kimmel said, “We don’t have to watch reality shows anymore because we are living in one.” \n\nHere’s reality-show Oscar week as I lived it:\n\nTuesday, February 21st\n\nI checked into Jeff Klein's Sunset Tower Hotel still exhausted from last weekend's oh-so-grand birthday extravaganza thrown by fun loving billionaire Stephen Schwarzman in Palm Beach—and headed straight to Charles Finch's photo exhibition, \"The Art of Behind the Scenes,\" to see rare candid on-set photos of Audrey Hepburn, Brigitte Bardot, Grace Kelly and Ava Gardner.\n\nOscar balloting had closed an hour earlier, and IndieWire's Oscar blogger Anne Thompson announced that a female friend had voted for all the diverse and minority nominees. This first hint of things to come didn’t register as a bell ringer for best picture. Spotted: Jean Pigozzi, Brett Ratner and Paul Haggis.\n\nBack at The Sunset Tower Bar, diminutive maitre d' Dmitri Dimitrov slid up to me, cupped his hands in prayer and whispered, \"Lady Gaga and Bradley Cooper are in the corner booth with Warner Bros. Sue Kroll.\" They were talking about their remake of \"A Star is Born\" going into production within the month. \n\nAt the next table was Ryan Murphy, creator of the multi-award winning FX mini-series \"The People vs. O.J. Simpson: American Crime Story,” eating with his muse Sarah Paulson, who won countless awards for portraying Marcia Clark. I joked that the Oscar nominated documentary \"O.J.: Made in America\" from ESPN would win because voters thought both films are the same. \n\nWednesday, February 22nd\n\nI met Adam Lindemann and museum director Michael Govan at LACMA’s The Inner Eye: Vision and Transcendence in African Art. Michael and I discussed the struggle to diversify the Academy. He told me that at LACMA he’d hired women, African American and Latino curators years before. \n\nVanity Fair Editor-in-Chief Graydon Carter and Barneys hosted a private dinner for \"La La Land\" at the Chateau Marmont. Graydon always tries to entertain the winning film. Drinks around the pool were followed by a seated dinner for fifty in a bungalow. Emma Stone brought her mother. Handsome hotelier Andre Balazs darts around. Ryan Gosling stayed home with his girlfriend Eva Mendes and their two baby girls. Emma talked about her next film \"Battle of the Sexes.\" She plays Billie Jean King opposite Steve Carell, an excellent tennis player in real life, as Bobby Riggs. \n\nDamien Chazelle came late from a dinner for the nominated directors. The Academy hosts a series of secret dinners during Oscar week for key nominees to keep them away from sponsors who profit from their celebrity. They also want to protect their own sponsor, ABC-TV, with exclusivity and audience surprise. \n\nThursday, February 23rd\n\nLarry Gagosian's annual Oscar-week art opening is always a hot ticket. Serious collectors blended in unnoticed among the mere lookers and pretty gallerists quietly pointing out one glorious Joe Bradley painting after another. Each costs a cool million and between 6:00pm and 8:00pm they are all sold. Buyers and Larry's close friends then migrate down the block to Mr. Chow. Elton John and David Furnish, Jonah Hill, Dakota Johnson, Sharon Stone, NBCUniversal's Ron Meyer, Gus Van Sant, Emily Ratajkowski, Dasha Zhukova, artists Alex Israel, Harmony Korine and Dan Colen, rocker Robbie Robertson and Page Six’s Ian Mohr dig into orange chicken on sticks. Larry's girls come around and slip his home address onto laps. This means you have made the cut to attend Larry's after party at his house. \n\nIan and I head to Paul Haggis' intimate Artist for Peace and Justice benefit dinner for 65 at the LA club No Name‎ where a great time set guests back $2,500 for Haiti. We arrive just in time to hear Jeff Bridges sing a song from \"Crazy Heart\", Jack Black recall \"School of Rock \" and Rita Wilson sing ABBA's \"Dancing Queen\". Jackson Browne is the master of ceremonies. \n\nI end up at A24's party at the Sunset Tower for their films \"20th Century Woman\" and \"Moonlight\". Barry Jenkins wants to know if he is winning the Oscar. I chirp, \"Yes, best adapted screenplay is all yours!\" Not the answer he was looking for. I should have said, \"Yes, you will win best picture, make history and bring the house down‎.\" I would have looked like a genius. \n\nFinally, I speak to Janelle Monae, who is absolutely stunning. She also wants to know if \"Hidden Figures\" is winning the Oscar. I assure her that her real win was at the box office. \n\nBefore passing out in my Sunset Tower suite, I email Damien Chazelle a social wrap-up on the evening, as he is now sick as a dog, in bed with his dog and has had visiting nurses injecting fluids into his flu-infested body all day. \n\nHe, too, asks if he is winning the Oscar. I write, \"It's not if, but how many\". \n\nFriday, February 24\n\nI’m a gal hell bent on making a fashion statement with every outing, who runs her business from the back seat of a chauffeured black Cadillac with the license plate PEG-FILM. So marching or attending a protest rally is not the likely place to find me. But when I read the United Talent Agency's United Voice Rally was happening at their Beverly Hills headquarters--2,000 of the creative community’s best looking turning out on a gorgeous afternoon to stand together for freedom of speech, and against exclusion and division, it was an invitation I couldn’t refuse. This is a substitute for UTA’s traditional pre-Oscar party--and the ten percenters donated and raised $320,000 for the American Civil Liberties Union and the International Rescue Committee. CEO Jeremy Zimmer and clients Jodie Foster and Michael J. Fox speak passionately. \n\nThe surprise highlight is taped remarks from Iranian filmmaker Asghar Farhadi, nominated for \"The Salesman\". Farhadi made international headlines announcing he would not travel to Hollywood in protest of President Trump's proposed travel ban on seven Muslim countries. Some Oscar voters do not see all five nominated foreign films, so Trump assured Asghar his Oscar. \n\nI stop by the Women in Film cocktail party at Nightingale Plaza where Meryl Streep announces, \"I feel like never saying anything again.\" We hear last year's best actress Brie Larson and activist/documentary nominee Ava DuVernay speak. Back at the Sunset Tower, Livia and Colin Firth host their annual dinner for 50 to celebrate The Green Carpet Challenge and The Journey to Sustainable Luxury. Spotted: Emma Stone, Meryl Streep, Ruth Negga, Kevin Bacon, Tom Ford, Salma Hayek, and Mick Jagger. Kyra Sedgwick arrives late from directing her first film, \"Story of a Girl,\" starring her husband Kevin Bacon. Kyra sits with Meryl over coffee and says how exciting it is to direct. When I ask Meryl if she will join the minute ranks of female directors, the acting icon says, \"Never. My job is done at the end of the day. I like to go home at night and let someone else worry about tomorrow's location.\" \n\nFriday ends at the CAA party, a tough ticket now handed out by Maha Dahkil and Michael Kives. The white tent is filled with a sea of celebrity. Every CAA client comes out to eat, mingle, kibbitz and dance. Spotted: Meryl Streep (yes, she had a busy day too), Leonardo DiCaprio, Scarlett Johansson, Gwyneth Paltrow, Orlando Bloom, Jerry Bruckheimer, J.J. Abrams, Ron Howard, Naomi Watts, Mick Jagger, Lady Gaga, Barry Jenkins, John Mayer, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Kate Hudson, Jon Hamm and Jeff Bezos.\n\nAt 2 a.m. I email Damien Chazelle another party report as he is still sick in bed. Now, a team of medical talent is working on getting him well for Oscar night.\n\nSaturday, February 25\n\nI march down to the Academy's theater to hear my producer friend (since \"Diner\"), Mark Johnson, also an Academy governor, conduct a symposium for four of five nominated foreign film directors. ‎ As brilliant as the conversation was, four guys from Australia, Denmark, Germany and Sweden depressingly knew that the absent Iranian Asghar Farhadi was winning. \n\nI took Mark, instead of the still-quarantined Damien Chazelle, up Coldwater Canyon to Barry Diller and Diane von Furstenberg's annual picnic lunch for Graydon Carter and Anna Scott. This gathering of the powerful and mighty occurs at exactly the same time as the Independent Spirit Awards for young and new talent. The two hot owners of A24, David Fenkel and Daniel Katz, are so sure their \"Moonlight\" was winning all six awards they are here instead of the Spirit Award’s tent on the beach in Santa Monica. When asked, \"What are you doing here?” they simultaneously say, \"Our people are there.\" The reason they were on the lawn for the first time is that they have a new television and film production deal with Diller. \n\n‎It's all very familiar, cozy and the best party of the week. Collectively there are more Oscar and Emmy winners on this lawn than will file into the Dolby Theater on Sunday. \n\nI sit with petite Gloria Cooper, mother of Bradley. She is the only one wearing a hat, a large white felt fedora hiding enormous black sunglasses and her pretty face. I entertain Gloria with local gossip, which she loves, but when I ask her for details on the start of production for \"A Star is Born,\" I get nothing. \n\nI ask guests, \"Who is winning best actor\"?  They reply, \"Denzel, but I voted for Casey\". Casey, who touched my heart on and off screen, ran in a tight race with humility, despite a nasty whisper campaign against him. I never asked about best picture. I'm still in thrall to the conventional wisdom: It's a \"La La\" landslide.\n\n\nRupert Murdoch brings his bride Jerry Hall who kisses and chats with Mick Jagger as the lawn people try to eavesdrop. Spotted: DvF's kids Alexander and Tatiana, Sir Howard Stringer, Oliver Stone, Ted Sarandos, Brett Ratner, Ron Meyer, Tom Ford, Larry Gagosian and Chrissie Erpf, Jeffrey Katzenberg, George Stevens, Jr., Toby Maguire, Sandy Gallin, Robert Kraft, Harvey Weinstein and breathtakingly beautiful Georgina Chapman, Lynn Wyatt, Fran Lebowitz, Henry Kravis, Jeff and Scott Berg and Irwin Winkler.\n\nAnother favorite event is Charles Finch's star-studded dinner at Madeo‎ sponsored by Chanel. I sit next to Amazon’s Roy Price and Oliver Stone, who sits next to Michael Keaton. I bring over Pharrell Williams to meet Oliver Stone, director of “Snowden” and “JFK.” The conversation segwayed from Hillary Clinton to Oliver’s new documentary on Putin. \n\nLily Collins comes over and asks to be introduced to Mick Jagger at the table next to us. She says, \"Tell Mick my father says ‘hello.’\" Lily is the daughter of Phil Collins and starred in Warren Beatty's \"Rules Don't Apply\". Mick, never one to pass up a flirt with an Audrey Hepburn look-alike, ‎whispers in her ear that he loved her in the film and was on the set, but sadly missed her.\n\nSpotted: Nicole Kidman, Naomi Watts, Christian Louboutin, Kristen Stewart, Ruth Negga and “Arrival” director Denis Villeneuve. \n\nWendy Stark, daughter of \"Funny Girl\" producer Ray Stark and granddaughter of Fanny Brice, invited me to Jeffrey Katzenberg's Night Before Party on the Fox lot for the Motion Picture Home. Walking around with Linda and Jerry Bruckheimer, I kiss David O. Russell and Colleen Camp. Brian D'Arcy James tells me he may return to his original role in \"Hamilton\" as King George. I go home with the heaviest swag bag in the world.\n\n\nSunday, Feb. 26th\n\nThe shocking end of the Oscar show continues to mystify me. How could I be so close to every filmmaker and totally miss the upset? \n\nBecause Damien is still sick, he begs off on his invitation to take me to Guy Oseary's—and heads back to bed. As I stand at the end of the Vanity Fair ‎carpet at the entrance to the Wallis Annenberg Center, Casey Affleck arrives holding his Oscar. I ask him to replace Damien as my escort and he says, \"Of course. I am leaving in 15 minutes. Don't lose me.” Casey then sends me off to find Jimmy Kimmel, who has already left the party. Fifteen minutes turns into an hour as everyone wants a selfie with the winner. \n\nSpotted from “Moonlight”: Barry Jenkins, Mahershala Ali, Naomie Harris, Jeremy Kleiner. From “La La Land” Emma Stone and John Legend. From “Manchester by the Sea”, Casey Affleck, Michelle Williams, Lucas Hedges and Kenny Lonergan. From “Hidden Figures”: Taraji P. Henson, Octavia Spencer and Pharrell Williams, and “Fences” Oscar winner Viola Davis. Also swirling around the room: Brie Larson, Dakota Fanning, Elton John, Amy Adams, Jennifer Aniston, Javier Bardem, Michael Shannon, Alicia Vikander, Scarlett Johansson, Lin-Manuel Miranda, Halle Berry, Isabelle Huppert, Michelle Dockery, Faye Dunaway, Andrew Garfield, Dakota Johnson, Mick Jagger and family, Kelly Ripa, and Patty and Lydia Hearst. I find exhausted Oscar show producers Jennifer Todd and Mike De Luca and tell them what a wonderful job they did. \n\nOn the way out, a familiar looking lady keeps waving and smiling at Casey as we wait in the cold for cars. I say, \"Casey, that is Monica Lewinsky waving at you.\" Casey is unfazed; he can’t wait to get out of the spotlight. Once we reach the Checkpoint Charlie to Guy's party, a team of girls wrapped in wool instructs the driver to lower the window and asks for a name. Casey, holding up the Oscar says, \"Affleck.” She says, \"You only have a plus one.\" The real deal is, if you win, you can bring a car full of friends—and eventually we’re cleared for takeoff. Once inside we lose each other in the darkness and pulsating Caribbean music. I get home at 5:00am, pack my three huge suitcases and rush off to the private airport in Van Nuys, still wondering how I could have missed “Moonlight”’s triumph. Why couldn’t I see the forest through the trees? I must have been in La La-land. \n\nxoxo,\nPeggy\n\nP.S. The following weekend I arrive in the Dominican Republic at Casa de Campo at the home of sugar baron Pepe Fanjul and his wife Emilia. Juan Carlos, the past king of Spain, wants to watch a few movies with me. I pulled a dozen DVDs out of my bag and say, \"Your Majesty, which one\"?  He says, \"First, \"La La Land\" for fun, then \"Moonlight\" because it won, then \"The Founder\" for American ingenuity.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

While independent reporting\ncontinues, Chinese official media have become more influential in the United Kingdom\nand internationally through their UK presence. Primarily, they have expanded their\noperations and reach. For example, the re-branded China Global Television Network\nEurope Ltd (CGTN), headquartered in London, is seeking to increase activities and\nChina Daily now distributes its China Watch “supplement” as an advertisement inside\nthe respected conservative newspaper the Daily Telegraph.

The CRS argued that \"[t]he refusal of the\nPresident to execute the law is indistinguishable from the power to suspend the laws.

A member of Congress, Senator Pepper, urged the\nSupreme Court to uphold the validity of the provision.

Despite a\nCarter Administration policy against complying with legislative vetoes (see Carter Presidential\nmemorandum, supra), the executive branch enforced the legislative veto, and, in so doing, allowed for\njudicial review of the statute. As with Lovett, the Justice Department argued against the\nconstitutionality of the statute.\n\n4) Morrison v. Olson, 487 U.S. 654 (1988): The President viewed the independent counsel statute as\nunconstitutional. The Attorney General enforced it, making findings and forwarding them to the\nSpecial Division.

Four Justices, in a concurrence by Justice Scalia, contended that the Tax Court\nwas a \"Department\" under the Appointments Clause.

In this regard, the concurrence stated that \"it was not\nenough simply to repose the power to execute the laws (or to appoint) in the President; it was also\nnecessary to provide him with the means to resist legislative encroachment upon that power.

The fear is that Xiis ana-\ntionalist, who has set China on an ag-\ngressive course of bullying its neigh-\nbors and confronting the United States.\n\nThe fear seems not unfounded. China\nhas intensified its territorial claims,\nfrom island disputes with Japan to vast\nareas of the South China Sea.\n\nXi frequently inspects People’s Liber-\nation Army forces, especially naval\nfleets, exhorting China’s military to\n“get ready to fight and to win wars”’\nand “to win regional warfare under\nLT.-oriented conditions.”\n\nXi holds China’s top three positions:\nhead of the ruling Communist Party of\nChina, head of state, and, as chairman\nof the Central Military Commission,\nhead of the military. He will likely lead\nChina for a decade.\n\nJust after becoming party chief in late\n2012, Xi announced what would become\nthe hallmark of his administration. ‘“‘The\nChinese Dream,’ he said, is “‘the great\nrejuvenation of the Chinese nation.”\n\nXi’s Chinese Dream is described as\nachieving the ‘““Two 100s”’: the material\ngoal of China becoming a ‘‘moderately\nwell-off society”’ by about 2020, the\n100th anniversary of the Chinese Com-\nmunist Party, and the modernization\ngoal of China becoming a fully de-\nveloped nation by about 2049, the 100th\nanniversary of the People’s Republic.\n\nThe Chinese Dream has four parts:\nStrong China (economically, politically,\ndiplomatically, scientifically, militar-\nily); Civilized China (equity and fair-\nness, rich culture, high morals); Har-\nmonious China (amity among social\nclasses); Beautiful China (healthy en-\nvironment, low pollution).\n\n“A moderately well-off society” is\nwhere all citizens, rural and urban, en-\njoy high standards of living. This in-\ncludes doubling the 2010 G.D.P. per cap-\nita (approaching $10,000 per person) by\nabout 2020 and completing urbanization\n(roughly one billion people, 70 percent\nof China’s population) by about 2030.\n\n“Modernization” means China re-\ngaining its position as a world leader in\nscience and technology as well as in eco-\nnomics and business; the resurgence of\nChinese civilization, culture and mili-\ntary might; and China participating ac-\ntively in all areas of human endeavor.\n\nIf Xi’s nationalism seems at odds\nwith these grand goals, it is not. Here\nare six reasons why:\n\nInternational Herald Cribune\n\nTHE GLOBAL EDITION OF THE NEW YORK TIMES\n\n« Need to consolidate power. Xi was not\nselected by Deng Xiaoping, the archi-\ntect of reform, as were his predecessors\n(Jiang Zemin and Hu Jintao), and he\nwas not elected by the people. Conven-\ntional wisdom had it that Xi would be a\nweak leader. In order to realize his\nChinese Dream, Xi needs to assert\nstrength and assure control. So far, he\nhas exceeded expectations.\n\n« Need to enable reform. Xi and Premier\nLi Keqiang are determined to enact far-\nreaching economic reforms, the most\nextensive in 15 years, but there is stiff\nresistance from those whose domi-\nnance would be diminished and bene-\nfits cut (such as state-owned enter-\nprises with ties to party power).\n\nThis resistance can no longer be\ncouched credibly in terms of ideology,\nso it appeals to nationalistic aspirations\nby accusing reformers of ‘worshipping\nWestern ways,” “glorifying Western\nmodels” or ‘‘caving in to Western pres-\nsures,”’ Xi’s proactive nationalism is a\nstrategy of ‘‘offense is the best de-\nfense’’ — an inoculation, as it were,\nagainst the political virus of being\nlabeled ‘‘soft’’ or “pro-Western.”\n\nReformers in China are generally as-\nsociated with pro-American attitudes\nand thus subject to fierce public crit-\nicism. By establishing himself as a na-\ntionalist operating independently of the\nUnited States (his first foreign trip was\nto Russia), Xiis able to secure econom-\nicreforms by distinguishing them from\nserving Western/American interests.\n\n* Need to legitimze one-party rule. To\nperpetuate its rule (which China’s top\nleaders truly believe is essential for the\nwell-being of the country), the Chinese\nCommunist Party has constructed a\ngrand narrative that is founded on\nthree critical claims: Only the Commu-\nnist Party can continue to improve cit-\nizen’s standard of living (and amelior-\nate severe social and economic\ndisparities); only the party can main-\ntain a stable, unified country and con-\nstruct a happy, harmonious society;\nand only the party can effect the ‘“‘reju-\nvenation of the Chinese nation,” which\nstresses a firm command of ‘‘core in-\nterests’’ (i.e., sovereignty and territori-\nality) and increasing global respect.\n\n* Maintain stability through unity.\nChina faces numerous internal ten-\nsions, especially a class-divided popu-\nlace (rich-poor, urban-rural, coastal-in-\nland) that have erupted within one\ngeneration. Moreover, an increasingly\ncomplex society can fracture along mul-\ntiple fault lines. Pollution, corruption,\nhealthcare, housing, migrant workers,\nworkers’ wages, social cynicism, chan-\nging values, among other raging issues,\n\nEDITORIAL OPINION\n\nthreaten to tragment society — and all\nare exacerbated by an energetic social\nmedia. Only nationalism, which reson-\nates intrinsically and passionately\nacross Chinese society, can provide suf-\nficiently strong social glue.\n\n© Differentiate from predecessors. Top\nChinese leaders must combine historic-\nal continuity with their own distin-\nguishing theories and practices. How\nshall Xi fare?\n\nEconomic growth rates must decline,\nand a host of domestic tensions (or\ncrises) are coming his way, such as\npublic anger at corruption and resis-\ntance to pollution. Hence another ra-\ntionale for nationalism.\n\nIn the past, nationalistic surges were\ntriggered largely by external events\n(such as NATO's accidental bombing of\nthe Chinese Embassy in Belgrade in\n1999). Xiis putting nationalism at the\ncore of his leadership — his nationalism\nis proactive, riding the high road of pa-\ntriotism and pride.\n\n* Personal beliefs. Xi has deep-seated\npatriotic convictions, the product of\nfamily, life and career. His father, Xi\nZhongxun, was a founder of the new\nChina and a leading reformer under\nDeng Xiaoping. In 2006, when Xi Jin-\nping was party secretary of Zhejiang\nProvince, he told me about Chinese\npride and patriotism as motivating\nChina’s historic resurgence — words\nremarkably similar to his recent pro-\nnouncements.\n\nSo is Xiareformer? A nationalist?\nThe answer is that he is both, because\nonly by being a nationalist can he be a\nreformer. American policy makers must\nunderstand Xi’s nationalism so that\nwhen the reigning superpower meets\nthe rising superpower, both can benefit.\n\nROBERT LAWRENCE KUHN is an international\ninvestment banker and the author, most\nrecently, of ‘How China's Leaders Think:\nThe Inside Story of China's Reform and\nWhat This Means for the Future.”\n\nGLOBAL VIEWPOINT/TRIBUNE MEDIA SERVICES\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_023701\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

The President should presume that enactments are constitutional. There will be some occasions,\nhowever, when a statute appears to conflict with the Constitution. In such cases, the President can and\nshould exercise his independent judgment to determine whether the statute is constitutional. In\nreaching a conclusion, the President should give great deference to the fact that Congress passed the\nstatute and that Congress believed it was upholding ‘its obligation to enact constitutional legislation.\nWhere possible, the President should construe provisions to avoid constitutional problems.\n\n4. The Supreme Court plays a special role in resolving disputes about the constitutionality of .\nenactments. As a general matter, if the President believes that the Court would sustain a particular\nprovision as constitutional, the President should execute the statute, notwithstanding his own beliefs\nabout the constitutional issue. If, however, the President, exercising his independent judgment,\ndetermines both that a provision would violate the Constitution and that it is probable that the Court\nwould agree with him, the President has the authority to decline to execute the statute.\n\n5. | Where the President's independent constitutional judgment and his determination of the Court's\nprobable decision converge on a conclusion of unconstitutionality, the President must make a decision\nabout whether‘or not to comply with the provision. That decision is necessarily specific to context, and\nit should be reached after careful weighing of the effect of compliance with the provision on the\nconstitutional rights of affected individuals and on the executive branch's constitutional authority. Also\nrelevant is the likelihood that compliance or non-compliance will permit judicial resolution of the\nissue. That is, the President may base his decision to comply (or decline to comply) in part on a desire\nto afford the Supreme Court an opportunity to review the constitutional judgment of the legislative\nbranch.\n\n6. The President has enhanced responsibility to resist unconstitutional provisions that encroach upon\nthe constitutional powers of the Presidency. Where the President believes that an enactment\nunconstitutionally limits his powers, he has the authority to defend his office and decline to abide by it,\nunless he is convinced that the Court would disagree with his assessment. If the President does not\nchallenge such provisions (i.e., by refusing to execute them), there often will be no occasion for\njudicial consideration of their constitutionality; a policy of consistent Presidential enforcement of\nstatutes limiting his power thus would deny the Supreme Court the opportunity to review the\nlimitations and thereby would allow for unconstitutional restrictions on the President's authority.\n\nSome legislative encroachments on executive authority, however, will not be justiciable or are for\nother reasons unlikely to be resolved in court. If resolution in the courts is unlikely and the President\ncannot look to a judicial determination, he must shoulder the responsibility of protecting the\nconstitutional role of the presidency. This is usually true, for example, of provisions limiting the\nPresident's authority as Commander in Chief. Where it is not possible to construe such provisions\nconstitutionally, the President has the authority to act on his understanding of the Constitution.\n\nOne example of a Presidential challenge to a statute encroaching upon his powers that did result in\nlitigation was Myers v. United States, 272 U.S. 52 (1926). In that case, President Wilson had defied a\nstatute that prevented him from removing postmasters without Senate approval; the Supreme Court\nultimately struck down the statute as an unconstitutional limitation on the President's removal power.\nMyers is particularly instructive because, at the time President Wilson acted, there was no Supreme\nCourt precedent on point and the statute was not manifestly unconstitutional. In fact, the\nconstitutionality of restrictions on the President's authority to remove executive branch officials had\nbeen debated since the passage of the Tenure of Office Act in 1867 over President Johnson's veto. The\ncloseness of the question was underscored by the fact that three Justices, including Justices Holmes and\nBrandeis, dissented in Myers. Yet, despite the unsettled constitutionality of President Wilson's action,\n\n‘no member of the Court in Myers suggested that Wilson overstepped his constitutional authority -- or\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_012387\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

Victims' advocates sought to expand on the protections found in other\npreviously-enacted victims' rights statutes, including, notably, the Victims' Rights and Restitution Act of 1990. 7? That statute\nhad also included a bill of rights for crime victims, yet because of limited enforcement mechanisms, crime victims had been\nunable to secure court protection of the rights listed in the statute. 73\n\nThe statute that Congress passed to solve these problems - the Crime Victims’ Rights Act of 2004 - gave victims \"the right to\nparticipate in the [*66] system.” 7+ It extended broad rights to crime victims, including \"the right to be treated with fairness\n\n25 and \"the reasonable right to confer with the attorney for the\n\nand with respect for the victim's dignity and privacy\"\nGovernment in the case.\" 7° It also commanded that these rights must be afforded by the Justice Department \"and other\ndepartments and agencies of the United States engaged in the detection, investigation, or prosecution of crime.\" 77 The CVRA\nalso contained specific enforcement mechanisms. The Act provided that rights can be \"asserted\" by \"the crime victim or the\ncrime victim's lawful representative, and the attorney for the Government ... .\"_ 28 The courts were also required under the Act\n\nto \"ensure that the crime victim is afforded the rights\" given by the law. 7?\n\nCongress appeared to have at least two goals in mind in passing the CVRA. The first was simply to ensure that crime victims\nunderstood what was happening in the criminal justice process. This goal is apparent from the fact that the CVRA gives crime\nvictims rights to notification about various court hearings, as well as more general rights to confer with prosecutors and to be\ntreated with fairness. 7° The CVRA's Senate sponsors explained:\n\nIn case after case we found victims, and their families, were ignored, cast aside, and treated as non-participants in a critical\nevent in their lives. They were kept in the dark by prosecutors too busy to care enough, by judges focused on [defendants']\nrights, and by a court system that simply did not have a place for them. 3!\n\nIn passing the CVRA, Congress sought to change the system's obliviousness to crime victims that often \"left crime victims and\n\ntheir families victimized yet again.\" 3?\n\n'9 Hon.

L. Rev. 844, *854\n\n1. Underenforcement Against Corruption\n\nCrimes of corruption by state and local officials are a good example of harms that, at times, criminal justice systems have\nunduly ignored. 34 Local police and prosecutors are not institutionally well-situated to pursue and evaluate those crimes. They\noften have professional, if not personal, ties to other local officials, which heightens the risk of undue favoritism or judgments\nthat are otherwise not fully disinterested. That is the main reason [*855] that federal investigators and prosecutors have state\n\nand local corruption in their portfolios. *°\n\n2. Underenforcement Against Sexual Assault\n\nSexual assault offenses are another context in which underenforcement is now widely recognized, but the causes are different.\n\nRather than favoritism toward offenders, the problem seems to be bias against the type of offense, and, in varying degrees,\nagainst the victims. Failures of police to rigorously pursue allegations of sexual assaults have been widely documented. %°\nAmong the explanations that advocates, attorneys and some scholars point to are \"the entrenched nature of long-recognized,\ngender-driven biases by police against domestic violence or sexual assault claims\" and \"against individuals from particular\ngroups or under particular circumstances,\" especially against victims who are poor or are racial, ethnic or gender minorities. 37\nOne large-scale empirical study of why rape-kit evidence remained untested, for example, suggested that the explanation in part\nwas \"negative beliefs and stereotypes about victims, which adversely affected the quality of the investigation.\" 3° It bears\nnoting that much of this bias is understood to be subtle or unconscious patterns built on cultural norms, rather than conscious,\npurposeful disfavor. 3? But when evidentiary records are incomplete or ambiguous, their effects are substantial.\n\n[*856]\n3. Underenforcement Against Police Excessive Uses of Force\n\nFailures to prosecute in the wake of police shootings and other possibly excessive uses of force against civilians are scenarios\nthat raise suspicions of both bias against victims, many of whom are black men (and often criminal suspects, another disfavored\n\nvictims and defendants\"); Natapoff, supra note 28, at 1753; David Alan Sklansky, Police and Democracy, /03 Mich. L. Rev. 1699, 1822\n(2005) (arguing that policing failures in some communities undercuts \"the egalitarian project of protecting all citizens from private\nviolence\").\n\n34 The point extends to private actors, especially organized crime, with ties to local officials.\n\n35 See infra Part III.B.1. On local corruption, see generally, for example, Corruption and American Cities: Essays and Case Studies in Ethical\nAccountability (Joaquin Jay Gonzalez III &? Roger L.

We suggest that\nthe key features of naive physics and folk psychology enumerated above can be mastered by an\nAGI in BlocksNBeadsWorld in spite of its imitations, and that — together with an appropriate\nAGI design — this probably suffices for creating an AGI with the inductive biases constituting\nhumanlike intelligence.\n\nTo drive this point home more thoroughly, consider three potential virtual world scenarios:\n\n1. A world containing realistic fluid dynamics, where a child can pour water back and forth\nbetween two cups of different shapes and sizes, to understand issues such as conservation\nof volume\n\n2. A world more like today’s Second Life, where fluids don’t really exist, and things like lakes\nare simulated via very simple rules, and pouring stuff back and forth between cups doesn’t\nhappen unless it’s programmed into the cups in a very specialized way\n\n3. A BlocksNBeadsWorld type world, where a child can pour masses of beads back and forth\nbetween cups, but not masses of liquid\n\nOur qualitative judgment is that Scenario 3 is going to allow a young AI to gain the same es-\nsential insights as Scenario 1, whereas Scenario 2 is just too impoverished. I have explored dozens\nof similar scenarios regarding different preschool tasks or cognitive development experiments,\nand come to similar conclusions across the board. Thus, our current view is that something like\nBlocksNBeadsWorld can serve as an adequate infrastructure for an AGI Preschool, supporting\nthe development of human-level, roughly human-like AGI.\n\nAnd, if this view turns out to be incorrect, and BlocksNBeads World is revealed as inadequate,\nthen we will very likely still advocate the conceptual approach enunciated above as a guide for\ndesigning virtual worlds for AGI. That is, we would suggest to explore the hypothetical failure\nof BlocksNBeadsWorld via asking two questions:\n\n1. Are there basic naive physics or folk psychology requirements that were missed in creating\nthe specifications, based on which the adequacy of BlocksNBeadsWorld was assessed?\n\n2. Does BlocksNBeads World fail to sufficiently emulate the real world in respect to some of\nthe articulated naive physics or folk psychology requirements?\n\nThe answers to these questions would guide the improvement of the world or the design of a\nbetter one.\n\nRegarding the practical implementation of BlocksNBeadsWorld, it seems clear that this is\nwithin the scope of modern game engine technology, however, it is not something that could be\nencompassed within an existing game or world engine without significant additions; it would\nrequire substantial custom engineering. There exist commodity and open-source physics en-\ngines that efficiently carry out Newtonian mechanics calculations; while they might require\nsome tuning and extension to handle BlocksNBead World, the main issue would be achieving\nadequate speed of physics calculation, which given current technology would need to be done\nvia modifying existing engines to appropriately distribute processing among multiple GPUs.\n\nFinally, an additional avenue that merits mention is the use of BlocksNBeads physics in-\nternally within an AGI system, as part of an internal simulation world that allows it to make\n“mind’s eye” estimative simulations of real or hypothetical physical situations. There seems no\nreason that the same physics software libraries couldn’t be used both for the external virtual\nworld that the AGI’s body lives in, and for an internal simulation world that the AGI uses as\na cognitive tool. In fact, the BlocksNBeads library could be used as an internal cognitive tool\nby AGI systems controlling physical robots as well. This might require more tuning of the bead\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_013221\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

It was not just Arik and the\nLikud, but other parties on the right that were actively attempting to bring down\nthe government. I was being squeezed politically: by opposition to the concessions,\nespecially on Jerusalem, I’d been willing to consider in pursuit of a peace\nagreement, and by the ever-worsening Palestinian violence. Shlomo Ben-Ami put\nit best, saying that in the view of most Israelis, “Arafat’s response to Camp David\nwas not peace, it was an intifada.”\n\nBy the second part of November, there were five separate motions of no-\nconfidence working their way through the Knesset. I could have quashed them all\nat a single stroke, since Arik, both publicly and privately, was conveying to me his\ncontinuing interest in joining a unity coalition. But I again decided against it, at\nthis stage not so much because I expected a peace deal, but because I believed\ncontinued Israeli engagement in the peace process was essential to preventing\nArafat from evading his responsibility for making a deal impossible.\n\nI could also have wrongfooted my opponents by insisting that any early election\nbe not just for a new Prime Minister but for a new Knesset, something very few\nexisting Knesset members were anxious to see happen. I did, in fact, do precisely\nthat at the end of November, delaying an immediate move to try to topple the\ngovernment. But I immediately regretted doing it. The game-playing side of\npolitics was the part I least understood, and most disliked. I recognized that to\nbring down the Knesset along with me would be unfair to the country, not to\nmention my own Labor Party, which still had the largest number of parliamentary\nseats. In pursuing my peace efforts with Hafez al-Assad, and at Camp David, I'd\ninsisted I was acting on the mandate I’d received in the Prime Ministerial election.\nIf the peace efforts had failed, or if a significant part of the country felt I was\nwrong to have tried in the way I did, surely the responsibility for that, too, should\nfall on me.\n\nI remained confident I had been right to make the efforts with Arafat, with\nAssad, and, of course, to have followed through on my pledge to withdraw our\ntroops from Lebanon.

Thanks again to Olivia for being so\nincredibly generous with her time and her thoughts.\n\nte OK ok\n\nA Sugar Baby Leaves The Business\n\nPreviously on Role/Reboot, we ran an interview with my friend Olivia, a 25-year-old\ngraduate student who had just started having sex for money through a \"sugar baby”\nwebsite called SeekingArrangement.com. In the interview, Olivia covered a lot of topics.\nShe mentioned that she usually feels powerful in her relationships with her clients. As she\nput it, \"When I show up, I don't feel like -- here is this rich, powerful person who is about\nto bestow wealth upon me. I feel like -- here is this person who is a bit sad and lonely,\nand maybe I can make their day better.\" Olivia also noted that her negotiations can be\ndelicate, because some men are quite squeamish while talking about money. And she\nexplained that she’s married -- but it was already an open relationship, and she doesn't see\nhaving sex for money as different from the other kinds of sex that she and her husband\nwere already having with other people. To deal with it, they're sure to communicate\nclearly. As Olivia said, \"We just have to talk about it.”\n\nIn the months since that interview, Olivia and I have hung out occasionally to talk about\nher experience with sex work. She's traveled across the city to meet me, and often bought\nme coffee; non-judgmental social support for sex workers can be rare, and I've seen more\nof her since she started the job. Although she really enjoyed the work at first, there were\ntough times too, especially after the novelty wore off. Recently, Olivia decided to stop\nseeing clients. We talked it through and she gave me permission to write about it. (She\nalso reviewed this article pre-publication.)\n\nObviously, there were logistical complexities from the beginning.

Playing it safe pays off. But those who stick their necks out and take a chance, may\nbring home significant gains. It is because of these competing strategies and potential payoffs that\nevolutionary biologists have imagined that selection could maintain both personality types within a\npopulation — a point noted earlier for the MAOA and glucose-related genes. If selection has worked in\nthis way, then there must be genetic variation that allows for both strategies. To date, the strongest\nevidence comes from a family of genes associated with the regulation of dopamine, with the memorable\nacronyms of DAT1, DRD2 and DRD4; each of these genes is associated with different forms, each form\nassociated with different levels of dopamine. Recall from chapter 2 that dopamine plays an essential role\nin our experience of reward, including how motivated we are to get it and what we anticipate based on our\nunderstanding of the situation — have we been rewarded in the past, how often, and how much? The idea\nhere is that those who carry genes that output a higher level of dopamine may weight rewards more\nheavily and thus, show risk-blindness; for these individuals, the eye is on the prize, not the path or\nobstacles to this prize.\n\nAcross a number of studies, results show that variation in the expression of these genes is\nassociated with high-risk, low self-control behaviors, including pathological gambling, substance abuse,\nsensation seeking, and financial investments. For example, in two separate studies, individuals with\ndifferent variants of the DRD4 gene played a financial investment game involving real money. In one,\ndesigned by Joan Chiao, subjects decided to invest in either a risky asset with variable returns or a riskless\nasset with consistent returns. In the second study, the Swedish economist Ana Dreber and the American\nanthropologist Corin Apicella allowed subjects to either walk away with an initial starting pot of money,\nor to invest some of it ina risky asset. Those with the DRD4 variant that expresses higher levels of\ndopamine were more likely to pursue the risky investment. What this work reveals is that part of the\nvariation we observe among people who make risky investments, drink too much alcohol, and gamble\nwith their income, is due to variation in the dopamine family of genes. These are hidden risks that come\nto life thanks to molecular biologist’s microscope. What also comes to life is the fact that these same\ngenes are relevant to violence, causing some to strike out even though there are significant risks and\nterrible consequences.\n\nIn several studies, using an American health data base of several thousand adolescents, results\nconsistently show a relationship between particular variants of the dopamine genes and violence. For\nexample, the sociologist Guang Guo examined the relationship between violent delinquency — involving\nuse of guns and knives — and variation in DRD2 and DAT1 among 2,5000 individuals ages 12-23 years.\n\nDRD2 was of particular interest because medical records and clinical trials reveal that administering\n\nHauser Chapter 4.

We show the sensitivity to S&P\n500 EPS to different assumed tax rates in the chart below, but we reiterate that these\nestimates exaggerate the actual impact on profits, as a significant portion of these\nbenefits would likely be passed on to consumers via lower prices.

But in the more than three years\nsince, I have often reflected upon Mr. Gottfried's mesmerizing performance. At a terrible\ntime it was an incongruous but welcome gift. He was inviting us to once again let loose.\n\nI bring up that night now because I've seen \"The Aristocrats,\" a new documentary inspired\nin part by Mr. Gottfried's strange triumph. Unveiled in January at Sundance, it's coming to\na theater near some of you this summer. (It could be the first movie to get an NC-17\nrating for sex and nudity not depicted on screen.) But I also bring up that night for the\nshadow it casts on a culture that is now caught in the vise of the government war against\n\"indecency.\" The chill cast by that war is taking new casualties each day, and with each\none, the commissars of censorship are emboldened to extend their reach. When even the\nexpletives of our soldiers in Iraq are censored on a public television documentary, Mr.\nGottfried's unchecked indecency seems to belong to another age.\n\nThe latest scheme for broadening that censorship arrived the week after the Oscar show\nwas reduced to colorless piffle on network television. Ted Stevens, the powerful chairman\nof the Senate Commerce Committee, pronounced himself sick of \"four-letter words with\nparticiples\" on cable and satellite television. \"I think we have the same power to deal with\ncable as over the air,\" he said, promising to carry the fight all the way to the Supreme\nCourt. Never mind that anyone can keep pay TV at bay by not purchasing it, and that any\nparent who does subscribe can click on foolproof blocking devices to censor any channel.\nSenator Stevens's point is to intimidate MTV, Comedy Central, the satellite radio\npurveyors of Howard Stern and countless others from this moment on, whether he\nultimately succeeds in exerting seemingly unconstitutional power over them or not.\n\nIf you can see only one of the shows that he wants to banish or launder, let me\nrecommend the series that probably has more four-letter words, with or without\nparticiples, than any in TV history. That would be \"Deadwood\" on HBO. Its linguistic gait\nbefits its chapter of American history, the story of a gold-rush mining camp in the Dakota\nTerritory of the late 1870's. \"Deadwood\" is the back story of a joke like \"The Aristocrats\"\nand of everything else that is joyously vulgar in American culture and that our new\nPuritans want to stamp out. It's the ur-text of Vegas and hip-hop and pulp fiction. It\ncaptures with Boschian relish what freedom, by turns cruel and comic and exhilarating,\nlooked and sounded like at full throttle in frontier America before anyone got around to\nbuilding churches or a government.\n\nIts creator is David Milch, a former Yale fraternity brother of George W. Bush and the\nonetime protégé of Robert Penn Warren, whose 1946 novel \"All the King's Men\" upends\nbowdlerized fairy tales about American politics just as \"Deadwood\" dismantles\nHollywood's old sanitized Westerns. As Mr. Milch says in an interview on the DVD of the\nfirst \"Deadwood\" season: \"It's very well documented that the obscenity of the West was\nstriking, and that the obscenity of mining camps was unbelievable.\" There was \"a\ntremendous energy to the language,\" he adds, but the reason this language never surfaced\nin movie Westerns during the genre's heyday was the Hays production code. For some 30\nyears starting in 1934, Hollywood's self-censorship strictures kept even married couples in\nseparate beds on screen.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_023098\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

He told me about his grandmother who\n“once went to a movie entitled Sur Les Troits de Paris. She thought it was a travelogue. She\ndidn’t after she got there of course...I heard about it.” I assured him that we had dealt with that\nproblem by providing a “prologue” that advises the audience who are admitted only before the\nfilm begins what they are about to see:\n\n“the story of a young girl who is trying to work out her relationships. There are a number\nof scenes which show the young girl and her lover nude. Several scenes depict sexual\nintercourse under various circumstances, some of them quite unusual. If you believe that\nyou would be offended or embarrassed by the showing of such scenes, you are invited at\nthis time to obtain a refund of your admission at the box office.”\n\nAs Judge Aldrich continued to press me about his grandmother’s sensibilities, I was reminded of\nthe old Jewish joke about the man with the broken watch who goes into a storefront window and\nasks the man behind the counter to fix his watch. “I don’t fix watches. I perform circumcisions,”\nthe man replied. “Then why do you have clocks and watches in your window,” the customer\nwondered. “What do you think I should put in my window?” the store owner responded.\n\nI had that joke in my head when I offered the following argument to Judge Aldrich:\n\nIf a store were to open in Boston which was simply marked “Pornography Shop,” it had\nnothing in the window, it had no advertising, it was a place where people like Stanley\ncould come and quietly and discreetly purchase their 8mm films, [I submit] that Stanley vs.\nGeorgia would proscribe prosecution of that seller. I submit that necessarily if there is this\nright to exercise one’s freedom to read and see a film, there is necessarily the concomitant\nright to purchase it. But the state has a great interest in making sure that the purchasing is\nnot done in a way that intrudes on sensibilities or intrudes on other legitimate interests.\n\nThe judges pressed me on whether obscene films, even when viewed in a restricted theater, could\n\ncause viewers to go out and commit crimes such as rape. I responded that if that were true, it\n\nwould be just as likely—perhaps even more so—that a person watching such films alone in his\nbasement would be influenced in that manner. I argued that Stanley had implicitly rejected that\ntheory.\n\nThe questioning persisted, with Judge Julian wondering whether Judge Aldrich’s aunt was typical:\nAs a matter of common sense though, unless we are to be so gullible as to be incredibly\ngullible, don’t the great vast majority of the people who go to a theater to see a film like\nthis know what they’re going to see?\n\nMR.

Rates increased 1.9 percentage points between 2000 and 2010, and\nincreased an additional 3.8 percentage points from 2010 to 2012. Average home prices dropped by\n11.8 percent in 2008, but then increased in 2009 and 2010 by 4 percent and 12.3 percent,\nrespectively. In 2012, average home prices fell 17.4% and then rebounded in 2013 with an increase of\n22.1%. The average sales price in 2013 was $538,369. Presumably, much of the increased supply of\nnew homes and condominiums has gone to non-residents and vacationers. Over the past decade,\nhousing costs have accelerated at a far greater pace than resident incomes, putting home ownership\nbeyond the reach of all but a few relatively wealthy islanders.\n\nIn 2013, St. Thomas and St. John had an average home sale price of $713,183, while the average home\nsale price in St. Croix was $306,083. While prices have not caught up with what they were in 2007, St.\nThomas and St. John have seen some recovery in the overall housing market. St. Croix, however,\ncontinues to suffer from the closing of the Hovensa refinery. In 2014, the average single family home\nsales price in St. Croix was $334,167, while in St. Thomas it was $909,839. 2015 year to date averages\nare show an increase in average single family home price in St. Croix and a decrease in St. Thomas and\nSt. John, with averages of $414,178 and $759,811 respectively.\n\nire\nIGY American Yacht Harbor Marina\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_018827\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

The charts and tables seem to tell us that innovation costs no more in failure\n\nrates and learning curves that daily coping does.\n\nMacroeconomics and Keynes\n\nMacro emerged in the 1930s under the influence of Keynes. Simon Kuznets, the chief\narchitect of the U.S. national accounts, was one of the five economists Keynes invited\nto proof the chapters of his General Theory as he wrote them’. National accounts\n\nwere soon reorganized along Keynesian lines.\n\nTo read the General Theory, a beautiful work, one would think that counter opinions\nwere led by his close friend Arthur Pigou. But Pigou was already in print with\nrecommendations much like Keynes’ when it was published in 1936. Opposition\ncame rather from Mises, the other Austrians, Lionel Robbins and the Chicago school.\nThey argued that intervention tends to make things worse. So do many economists\ntoday. Keynes believed in fiscal and monetary policy as I describe in Chapter 1. He\n\nfavored fiscal policy.\n\nChapter 2 said that he made a basic distinction between investment producing new\nthings and repurchase of things already produced. Only the first counted as real\ninvestment. The difference matters because only the first puts plant and people to\nwork. Transfers neither add nor subtract value. Even so, my own language counts all\nas investment, and ranks investment only by return. I make no distinction among\ninvestment adding new plant and equipment, or investment in stocks and bonds\n\nalready issued, or in existing structures, or even under the mattress.\n\n3 The others were Harrod, Sraffa, Joan Robinson and Ralph Hawtree.\n\nChapter 8 Banks, Money and Macroeconomics 2/8/16 14\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_011103\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

It was\ngenerally holding.\n\nBut fundamentally, Arik’s war plan was not a response to the Katyushas. It\nwas a way of using military force to achieve Prime Minister Begin’s political\naim: stopping the Camp David peace process in its tracks, and ensuring it did\nnot go beyond the peace treaty with Egypt. And even that message was not\nprincipally intended for the Palestinians, I suspect, but for the Americans.\nIsrael’s Labor-led governments had always calculated that we needed at least\nsome measure of support from foreign allies, especially the US. Under Begin,\nwe'd already bombed Saddam Hussein’s nuclear reactor without telling the\nAmericans beforehand. Shortly after I returned to the kirya, he provoked further\nanger in Washington by announcing the de facto annexation of the Golan — in\neffect “balancing” our Sinai withdrawal with a dramatic reassertion of Israeli\ncontrol over other land captured in the 1967 war. Part of Arik’s plan in Lebanon\nwas to deliver an even more forceful riposte to any suggestion that we would\ngive up control of the West Bank and Gaza.\n\nYet these political aims, which I was gradually beginning to grasp in their\nfull form through my discussions with Arik, were only part of the reason I was\ndeeply uneasy about the plans for our Lebanon invasion. Having now spent\nnearly two decades in the military, I recognized that the security challenge north\nof the border was real. I did not believe it was inherently wrong for Begin’s\ngovernment to order a pre-emptive military operation with the aim of ending it.\nMy view, as an army officer, was that the decision on how, when and whether\nto go to war was for our elected government. But for that principle to work, I\nalso believed that government ministers had to know what they were deciding.\nThe more we geared up for an invasion, the less certain I became that Begin’s\ncabinet understood what we were planning to do.\n\nArik’s original plan was codenamed Oranim: Hebrew for “pine trees”. It\ninvolved pushing deep into Lebanon, all the way up to the strategically critical\nroad that ran between Beirut and Damascus. We would link up in Beirut with\nthe main Maronite Christian force, the Phalangists, whom we had been\nsupporting and training for several years. When that plan was presented to\nBegin’s cabinet at the end of 1981, however, most ministers opposed it. Thus\nwas born Arik’s Plan B, so-called “Little Pines”. Its stated aim was a lot more\nmodest. We would create a “security zone” — a 40-kilometer, or 25-mile, strip\nrunning north of the border with Lebanon.\n\n194\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_011665\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

China's claim of\nownership of the South China Sea, along with its\ncreeping militarization of previously uninhabited\nislets, is at least as ambitious as Russia's move,\nthough the impact is perhaps less jolting given\nthe dearth of occupied populations.\n\nThere have been other reversions to 20th-centu-\nry methods of repression. For example:\n\nPolitical prisoners: During the 20th century,\nopposition figures, political dissidents, advocates\nfor minority groups, and people who wrote critical\ncommentaries were regularly sentenced to prison\nterms, often under grim conditions, by dicta-\ntorships of all stripes. Amnesty International's\nfounding mission was the defense of what were\ncalled “prisoners of conscience,” and they ranged\nfrom dissidents and Jewish refuseniks in the So-\nviet Union to those who resisted right-wing juntas\nin Latin America. Soviet dissidents like Natan\nSharansky and Vladimir Bukovsky were the focus\nof international campaigns organized by human\nrights organizations and cautiously embraced by\nthe United States and other governments.\n\nThe ranks of political prisoners declined sub-\nstantially after the end of the Cold War and the\ncollapse of dictatorships in Latin America, Asia,\nand to acertain extent Africa. Indeed, it was a\nmajor objective of the new authoritarianism to\nmaintain political control without shedding blood\nor putting people behind bars, actions that pro-\nvoked condemnation by human rights advocates,\ndemocratic governments, and UN entities.\n\nRecently, however, the political prisoner has\nmade a comeback. One notably egregious\noffender is Azerbaijan. Under President Ilham\nAliyev, this country of just 9.4 million people has\namassed one of the world's largest numbers of\npolitical prisoners per capita, with approximately\n80 prisoners of conscience during 2015, accord-\ning to verified figures. Azerbaijan's repression\nhas grown despite the fact that Aliyev already\nenjoyed near-total control of key institutions and\ndistinctly gentle treatment from U.S. and Euro-\npean political leaders due to Azerbaijan's role as\nan alternative to Russian energy exports.\n\nVenezuela also has a substantial number of\npolitical prisoners—around 100 as of June 2016,\naccording to credible sources, including promi-\n\nnent members of the political opposition.? Under\nPresident Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, some estimates\nsuggest that Egypt holds as many as 60,000 polit-\nical prisoners.’ Turkish authorities have similarly\nrounded up tens of thousands of people in the\nwake of the July 2016 coup attempt. A much\nsmaller country, Bahrain, has convicted hundreds\nof people of political crimes since 2011, when the\nmonarchy began arresting members of the polit-\nical opposition who were demanding democratic\nelections and other freedoms.’\n\nChina is in a class by itself. Since the 1989\ncrackdown on prodemocracy protests in Tian-\nanmen Square, the Communist Party leadership\nhas regularly jailed political dissidents, espe-\ncially those who argued publicly for democratic\npolitical changes or made gestures toward the\nformation of opposition political parties. The\nmost notable political prisoner is Liu Xiaobo, the\nNobel Peace Prize winner who was sentenced to\n11 years in prison in 2009. However, conditions\nhave grown far worse under President Xi Jinping,\nas a numbing procession of lawyers, journalists,\nbloggers, women's advocates, minority rights\ncampaigners, and religious believers have been\ndetained, placed under house arrest, disap-\npeared, or sentenced to prison.>\n\nPublic confessions: Humiliating public con-\nfessions of ideological crimes were a staple of\nSoviet leader Joseph Stalin's purges and Mao\nZedong’s Cultural Revolution in China. They\nwere also employed by Eastern European sat-\nellite regimes during the show trials of the late\n1940s. A peculiarly communist technique, the\npublic confession was largely abandoned after\nthe deaths of Stalin and Mao.\n\nUnder Xi, China has revived the practice. A grow-\ning list of editors, human rights lawyers, and advo-\ncates of political reform have been coerced into\nmaking televised confessions of their “crimes.”\nThe Chinese authorities even intimidated a Swed-\nish citizen, legal reform activist Peter Dahlin, into\nconfessing that he broke Chinese law and “hurt\nthe feelings of the Chinese people.” Dahlin was\naccused of endangering state security by funding\nhuman rights lawyers and compiling reports on\nthe state of human rights in China.®\n\nntensified media domination: Most modern au-\nthoritarian countries allowed a sufficient degree\n\nwww.freedomhouse.org\n\n53\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_019287\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

This means that telling\na student a fact that he needs just makes it all too simple. Figuring out\nwhat you need is the real issue.

Now\nbear in mind that going to Yale isn’t such a bad experience. This is\nnot my point. But Yale’s attitude (and every other top university’s at-\ntitude) toward what those universities are inherently about is seriously\nharming the education of every high school student and almost every\ncollege student in the country. Yale doesn’t know that it is doing this.\n\nThe faculty of Yale didn’t wake up one morning and think that\ndestroying the American education system would be a good idea. They\nnever think that subject-based education is a bad thing. They are pro-\nfessors of subjects, after all. It makes sense to them.\n\nMost of the Yale faculty doesn’t think for even a minute about\nthe U.S. high school system, or the community college system, or the\nthousands of other colleges in the United States. Yale professors are\nthinking about their research, ideas, and projects. Yale administrators\nare thinking about making Yale work better and about money and\nprestige issues. They are not thinking that the subject-based education\nthat is the basis of the university structure has filtered down to high\nschool for no good reason. They think that there is a good reason: to\nprepare high school students for college, namely to make the profes-\nsors’ lives easier when the students arrive at college.\n\nThey do not know they are killing education with their subject ori-\nentation. But they are, just as surely as if they had a plan to do so and\nwere working on it on a daily basis. And, the parents who just must\nsend their kids to Yale are regularly giving them the power to continue\ndoing just that.\n\nPeople who do not live and work within the confines of a great\nuniversity imagine that professors are basically teachers, like high\nschool teachers but more intellectual. They do not understand the col-\nlective mindset at a place like Yale, a mindset that the Yale faculty, for\nthe most part, is perfectly happy with. They do not understand why\nasking what I taught was a funny question. They do not readily get, if\nteaching isn’t a professor’s main concern, what exactly his concerns\nwould be.\n\nTo explain all this requires looking at the life of a typical Yale fac-\nulty member and beginning to understand the world in which he\nlives. We must begin by understanding the aims of the university it-\nself. Universities are employers, after all, and professors, like any other\nemployee, worry about what their boss thinks of them.

The\nDepartment also has experience in conducting training on juvenile victims through the Innocence\nLost National Initiative. Effective efforts to combat trafficking must mobilize the expertise of\nHAS, DHS, and DOJ.\n\nDOJ also notes a misspelling in the new subsection (F)(ii)— “edibility” instead of\n“eligibility”.\n\n16. Section 214\n\nSection 214 of the bill authorizes the Attorney General to make grants to assist victims of\nsevere forms of trafficking up to $2.5 million in 2008, increasing to $15 million in 2011. The\nDepartment of Justice already has authority to make grants for the provision of services for crime\nvictims and does so at a level in excess of $250 million a year.

The following discussion is based on the assumption that\nthe Fund will not be treated as a “publicly traded partnership.”\n\nTreatment of U.S. Partners and Non-US. Partners - The discussion below addresses separately\ncertain U.S. federal income tax matters relevant to U.S. Partners and Non-U.S. Partners. For\npurposes of this discussion, the term “U.S. person” generally means any U.S. citizen or resident\nindividual, any corporation, limited liability company, or partnership organized under U.S. law,\nany estate (other than an estate the income of which, from sources outside the U.S. that is not\neffectively connected with a trade or business within the U.S., is not includible in its gross\nincome for U.S. federal income tax purposes), and any trust if a court within the U.S. is able to\nexercise primary supervision over the administration of the trust and one or more U.S. persons\nhave the authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust. The term “U.S. Partner”\nmeans any partner that is a U.S. person and, unless the context otherwise requires, includes any\nU.S. person that holds an equity interest in the Fund through one or more partnerships or other\nentities treated as transparent for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The term “Non-U.S.\nPartner” means a Partner that is not a U.S. person.\n\nTaxation of Fund Operations Generally - As a partnership, the Fund will not pay U.S. federal\nincome taxes, but each U.S. Partner will be required to report that Partner’s distributive share\n(whether or not distributed) of the Fund’s income, gains, losses, deductions and credits of the\ncharacter specified in Section 702 of the Code. It is possible that the U.S. Partners could incur\nU.S. federal income tax liabilities without receiving from the Fund sufficient distributions to\ndefray such tax liabilities. The Fund’s taxable year will be the calendar year, or such other\nperiod as required by the Code. Tax information will be delivered to all Partners on an annual\nbasis to enable the Partners to complete their tax returns.\n\nElection to Adjust Basis of Fund Assets - Under the principal agreements relating to the Fund\nand Section 754 of the Code, the General Partner will have the authority to elect to adjust the\nbasis of the Fund’s assets (commonly referred to as “Section 754 adjustments”) in connection\nwith certain distributions made by the Fund to Partners or certain transfers of Limited Partner\nInterests in the Fund. Although the General Partner has no present intention of making an\nelection on behalf of the Fund under Section 754 of the Code, Section 754 adjustments may\nnevertheless be mandatory under certain circumstances and could affect the amount of a\nPartner’s allocations (for U.S. federal income tax purposes) of gain or loss recognized by the\nFund on a disposition of its assets.\n\nThe General Partner also will have the authority under the principal agreements relating to the\nFund to elect to treat the Fund as an “electing investment partnership” and, as a result,\npotentially avoid making Section 754 adjustments that otherwise would be mandatory with\nrespect to certain transfers of Limited Partner Interests in the Fund. Such election, however,\nmay result in the disallowance (for U.S. federal income tax purposes) of certain losses allocated\nby the Fund to transferees of Limited Partner Interests in the Fund. It is possible, however, that\nthe Fund will not be able to qualify as an electing investment partnership.\n\nThe General Partner will have the authority to require any Partner engaging in a transaction\nthat requires a Section 754 adjustment (for example, a transfer of the Partner’s Limited Partner\n\nInterest) to bear the ongoing administrative and other costs incurred by the Fund or its Partners\nin connection with these basis adjustment rules.

Egypt’s economy has nose-dived since the uprising, and\nthe new government really does need the money to stay afloat.

The missiles seemed to be pointed north, away from them. But the\nbattalion commander was asking us for permission to open fire.\n\n“Do not open fire,” I was saying as Yanoush arrived. “I repeat: do not open\nfire.” When Yanoush asked me what was going on, I told him the lead unit had\nreported unknown vehicles with missiles and wanted to know whether it could\nattack. “Tell them yes,” Yanoush said. I looked first at him, then at Mitzna. “We\ncan’t,” I said. “It’s dark. The situation is confused. We don’t know whose\nmissiles these are. It doesn’t make sense they’d be Syrian, just sitting there,\npointed north. At least give it a few minutes.” I think Yanoush would have\ngrabbed the microphone and told the unit to fire had not Amram been there as\nwell. Together, we convinced him to hold off. I ordered the brigade commander\nto get one of the battalion’s APC crews to go out on foot and get as near as\npossible to the missiles. It was nearly 15 minutes later when they returned. They\nsaid they’d never seen this kind of missile vehicle, but that the soldiers manning\nthem seemed to be speaking Hebrew. It turned out to be a new ground-to-\nground missile, not yet formally in service, which had been sent into Lebanon\nwithout our knowledge by the northern command.\n\nWhile that trouble was averted, much worse lay ahead. Yanoush asked to be\nbrought up to date on our progress in taking control of the area around the\nTovlano Triangle. We briefed him on the situation as we understood it: that\nRifkind had reported the triangle was clear, but that the second brigade had still\nnot reached it. Yanoush tried to radio the divisional commanders. When he\ncouldn’t raise them, he ordered the brigade and battalion commanders to pick\nup their pace and move forward.\n\nWith Yanoush back and the advance resumed, I tried to grab at least a few\nhours’ sleep. But around 3:45 am, a junior officer shook me awake. When I\nrejoined Yanoush and Amram, they told me the lead battalion was now in deep\ntrouble. It was led by Ira Ephron, one of Dan Shomron’s best company\ncommanders during the 1973 war. For reasons I’ve never been able to establish,\nIra’s orders were not to take the hills south of the triangle as we’d planned, but\nto go through it to a point two miles or so north. Minutes after crossing the\ntriangle, his tanks came under heavy fire. Hoping to escape, he kept going, only\nto find himself surrounded by a Syrian armored force. They were trapped near a\nvillage called Sultan Yacoub, nearly three miles north of Tovlano. Since it was\nearly June, it would be light soon, and his predicament could only get worse.\n\nAt dawn, he reported he was under heavy artillery, anti-tank missile, RPG\nand close-range rifle fire. The only realistic hope was to retreat.

The rewriting of history will become more wide-\nspread and will greatly complicate societal ef-\nforts to confront both past and present political\nabuses. The rehabilitation of Joseph Stalin and\nthe airbrushing of Mao Zedong’s destructive\nreign serve to facilitate an authoritarian form of\nnationalism in which strength and unity super-\nsede justice and freedom, and the state is exalt-\ned at the expense of individual human beings.\n\n8. Authoritarian or illiberal forces are more likely to\ngain supremacy in countries where the parties\nthat represent liberal democracy do not simply\nlose elections, but experience a full-blown political\ncollapse, whether through corruption, ineptitude,\nor failure to build lasting bonds with the public. In\nthe end, elections do matter, and real change still\nrequires victory at the polls. This is why robust,\nself-confident, and uncorrupted opposition par-\nties are essential to democracy’s survival.\n\nRecommendations\n\nIn studies of this kind, recommendations are primarily\naddressed to policymakers, particularly in the admin-\nistration and Congress of the United States. Given\nthe election of Donald Trump, however, a different\napproach is called for.\n\nTrump has made clear again and again his admiration\nfor Vladimir Putin, to the point of asserting a kind of\nmoral equivalency between the Russian and American\ngovernments. Since he assumed office, Trump and\ncertain aides have encouraged in America the kind of\n“oost-truth” environment that has prevailed in Russia\nunder Putin. The new president has shown no interest\nin an American role in promoting human rights and\ndemocracy around the world; indeed, he seemed to\ndismiss this core element of U.S. foreign policy in\n\nhis initial address to Congress, instead emphasizing\n“harmony and stability\" and “the sovereign rights of all\nnations.” Under these circumstances, to rely first and\nforemost on the U.S. government to meet the chal-\nlenge posed by Russia, China, and other authoritarian\nstates would amount to an exercise in futility.\n\nThe role of governments, both in the United States\nand Europe, will remain crucial. But the threat posed\nby modern authoritarianism has spread well beyond\nits original proving grounds. To some extent, the prob-\nlems discussed in this report have already infected\nthe United States and a number of European coun-\ntries. They represent a menace to the media, academ-\nic freedom, civil society, electoral systems, and the\n\nrule of law. They even put in jeopardy the integrity of\nthe facts and figures that an accountable government\nand a successful economy require. When the values\nof the political leadership are seen to waver, indepen-\ndent, nongovernmental voices and institutions will\n\nbe called upon to do their part—not just to defend\ndemocracy at home, but to convince skeptical politi-\ncians and citizens that supporting the same struggle\nabroad serves the public interest.\n\nTo the U.S. government: We urge the Trump adminis-\ntration to appoint a director of global communications\nwho is experienced in journalism and allow that per-\nson to build a program to counter hostile authoritari-\nan messaging through up-to-date delivery techniques,\nhonest reporting, and forthright commentary. Near\nthe end of 2016, Congress passed legislation that\nplaced the country’s government-supported interna-\ntional media outlets—Voice of America (VOA), Radio\nFree Europe/Radio Liberty (RFE/RL), and their sister\nservices focused on Asia and other regions—under\nmore direct presidential control, on the theory that a\ncommander-in-chief who was committed to counter-\ning aggressive Russian influence would be better able\nto develop and implement new strategies. President\nTrump has yet to indicate how he intends to use this\nauthority.\n\nIn the contest against Soviet communism, America’s\ninternational broadcasting entities were the crown\njewels of U.S. soft power. Indeed, in some countries,\nsuch as Poland or Romania, Radio Free Europe\nfunctioned as the opposition press, and clearly had\n\na greater audience and more influence than the\ncensored government press. In the post-Cold War\nperiod, what were initially shortwave radio services\nhave evolved into modern media outlets, with video\ncontent, podcasts, blogs, social media engagement,\nand other forms of information delivery. Nevertheless,\nthe United States today needs to update the strategy\nand operations of its publicly supported broadcast-\ners and—most importantly—provide them with the\nresources to compete with a Russian propaganda\nmachine that is nimble, attuned to popular discontent,\nand generously funded.\n\nTo the independent media: The mainstream press\nin the United States has recently shown increased\ninterest in reporting on Russian methods of infor-\nmation warfare, some of which have been embraced\nby far-right media outlets that seek to undermine\npopular support for the core institutions of Ameri-\ncan democracy.

The largest\nrecent development in this area has been East End Plaza, which was constructed in 2008. However,\nthe completion of this commercial building coincided with the downturn in the overall economy in the\nterritory, and the property has struggled to reach stabilization. There is also a newly constructed,\nsmall commercial strip center in close proximity to the subject called Crosswinds Center that opened\napproximately two years ago.

Three blew themselves up at the stadium at Saint-\nDenis, where President Hollande was attending a match between France and Germany, while the\nothers shot killed 130 people at cafes, restaurants and a theater. 388 others had been wounded in\nthe carnage. The attack was planned over many months by Abdelhamid Abaaoud, a 28-year old\nBelgium citizen of Moroccan origins, who served ISIS as a logistics officer in Syria in 2014. To\norganize the attack, he smuggled three suicide bombers into Europe through Greece, raise\nfinancing, set up a base in the Molenbeek section of Brussels, import deactivated assault weapons\nfrom Slovenia (which then had to be restored by a technician), buy ammunition, acquire suicide\nvests, obtain “burner” cell phones, rent cars and make on-line bookings for quarters in Paris for\nthe nine attackers.. Even though Abaaoud was well known to western intelligence services, none\nof the communications surrounding the preparations for the attack came to the attention of the\nNSA or its allied services in Europe.\n\nThose Paris attackers who did not kill themselves with their suicide vests were killed by the\npolice, but the real challenge in such a terrorist operation is not bringing culprits to justice after\nthe massacre civilians. It is preventing them from carrying it out. As “soft targets,” such as\nrestaurants, cafes, theaters and street gatherings, cannot be continually protected by police, the\nonly practical means by which a government can prevent such attacks is to learn in advance about\ntheir planning and preparations. One means of acquiring this information is by listening in on the\nchannels through which members of loosely-knit terrorists organizations, such as ISIS,\ncommunicates with one another. This form of intelligence-gathering obviously works best so\nlong as the terrorists remain unaware that the communication channels they are using are being\nmonitored. Once they find out that their messages and conversations are being intercepted, they\nwill likely find a safer means to communicate important information. For that reason,\ncommunications intelligence organizations keep the sources and methods they employ for\nmonitoring these channels in a tightly-sealed envelope of secrecy.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_020374\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

I\ndon’t want to overwork you on the bear-baiting, but in order to have a film of bear-\nbaiting, you’ve got to go through unlawful process in the first instance.\n\nWith less than a minute before my time had expired, the Chief Justice asked whether I thought the\nanalogy to the bear-baiting contest was “valid.” I politely told him what I thought:\n\nI think the analogy of bear-baiting is not valid [because it] is an illegal act which hurts\nanimals. It is different from [lovemaking] presented on a screen to a public which has\nchosen to view it.\n\nBy this point my time was nearly up. I quickly summarized my argument that under a functional\ndefinition of privacy\n\nA theater with its curtains drawn deserves [at least as much constitutional protection as] a\nhome with its shades drawn up.\n\nThe Chief Justice had monopolized the entire argument with his bear-baiting analogy. He 9or his\nlaw clerksO had apparently prepared a series of questions for me about bear baiting and Burger\nhad simply gone down the list ignoring my answers. The other eight justices were unable to ask\nquestions, though several of them seemed anxious to probe certain points. Some of them seemed\nembarrassed by their Chief’s performance. By the end of the argument, I finally understood what\na bear-baiting contest must feel like—at least to the bear. It was not only the dumbest series of\nquestions I have ever been asked during an oral argument—with at the possible exception of\nthose put to me by a senile judge about the facts of the next case scheduled for argument. It was\nprobably the stupidest conversation I’ve ever had with anyone about the First Amendment. But\nno one ever said that intelligence was a criterion for being a judge, or even a Chief Justice. What\nmattered to Warren Burger was that he looked like what a Chief Justice is supposed to look like!\n\nA few months later the Supreme Court rendered a 5 to 3 decision in the J Am Curious Yellow case\nthat did not reach the broad issue decided by the district court (nor did it mention bear-baiting);\ninstead, it decided the case on a narrow procedural ground. We eventually settled the case to the\nadvantage of the defendants. The film was shown throughout the country and no one went to\nprison. Judge Aldrich’s opinion, suggesting that all censorship of the content of movies exhibited\nto adults in discreet settings was unconstitutional, remained the only court decision on that issue\nuntil June of 1973, when the Supreme Court changed the definition of obscenity in a case called\nMiller v. California and a series of companion decisions.\n\nIn these cases Chief Justice Burger, writing for the majority, expressly and emphatically rejected\nthe approach I had argued in the J Am Curious Yellow case.\n\n104\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_017191\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

The decrease in gray matter allows habitual liars to lie without feeling guilty. The messaging\ncenter that sends healthy subjects moral reminders about the virtues of truth, is shut down or barely\naudible within the mind of a pathological liar. The brain of a pathological liar allows for the ultimate\npoker face. The brain of a healthy individual allows us to perfect the poker face by repeating a distorted\nnarrative, converting a lie into a self-justified truth. This is dangerous denial.\n\nWhen we lie, either to manipulate someone else or ourselves, we distort the truth. We can either\ndo this on the fly or use a narrative held in long-term memory. When Hilary Clinton told her supporters\nthat she had to dodge bullets in Bosnia, she either lied in the moment to convey a stronger image or she\ndeveloped this distortion over a long period of time. In the first instance, she knew that her comment\nabout Bosnia was false. She was deceptive, but not self-deceived. In the second case, she was self-\ndeceived and most likely unaware. Her narrative was so clear that she could picture running for cover\nwithout the usual welcoming party. Several studies now reveal that both forms of lying engage brain\nareas associated with self-control and conflict— the right backside of the prefrontal cortex and the\nanterior cingulate. This makes sense. To tell a lie, either to oneself or another, requires controlling what\nwe know about reality to convey an alternative reality. When we hold both versions of this narrative in\nmind, there is conflict. As we rehearse one version more than the other, the conflict dissipates. The more\nwe rehearse, the more we push this narrative into long term memory. The more we push this narrative\ninto long term memory, the more it becomes part of what we believe is true. The more we believe it is\ntrue, the more we hold onto a narrative that can be used to justify our actions.\n\nThe imaging results fit well with our understanding of which brain regions are involved in self-\ncontrol, conflict, memory, and social knowledge. To understand which regions are either necessary or\nsufficient for representing truths and lies, we turn to a technique called ‘ranscranial direct current\nstimulation. This method allows researchers to safely increase or decrease activity in a brain area\nthrough electrical stimulation. Think of this technique as a volume knob on an old fashioned radio. Turn it\nclockwise and you amplify the signal. Turn it counter-clockwise and you quiet the signal. When the\nGerman neuroscientist Ahmed Karim and his colleagues applied this technique to the right backside of\nthe prefrontal cortex, and decreased activity, healthy subjects were better at telling lies, lied without guilt,\nand were less stressed out as measured by the sweatiness of their skin. This pattern mirrors the natural\nstate of pathological liars. Absent the circuitry in the brain that exerts self-control over our distortions,\nKarim turned healthy subjects into conscience-free, poker-faced, liars.\n\nIf self-deception and deception are not only part of normal brain function, but adaptive processes,\nthen what makes this system turn toxic? What tips the brain over to the dark side, allowing self-deceptive\n\nillusions to empower the individuals and groups to cause great harm?\n\nHauser Chapter 3.

And I was just wondering what you would recommend to counteract these\nmovements, which are growing.\n\nBannon: One of the reasons that you can understand how they’re being fueled is that\nthey’re not seeing the benefits of capitalism. I mean particularly — and I think it’s\nparticularly more advanced in Europe than it is in the United States, but in the United\nStates it’s getting pretty advanced — is that when you have this kind of crony capitalism,\nyou have a different set of rules for the people that make the rules. It’s this partnership of\nbig government and corporatists. I think it starts to fuel, particularly as you start to see\nnegative job creation. If you go back, in fact, and look at the United States’ GDP, you look\nat a bunch of Europe. If you take out government spending, you know, we’ve had negative\ngrowth on a real basis for over a decade.\n\nAnd that all trickles down to the man in the street. If you look at people’s lives, and\nparticularly millennials, look at people under 30 — people under 30, there’s 50% really\nunder employment of people in the United States, which is probably the most advanced\neconomy in the West, and it gets worse in Europe.\n\nI think in Spain it’s something like 50 or 60% of the youth under 30 are underemployed.\nAnd that means the decade of their twenties, which is where you have to learn a skill,\nwhere you have to learn a craft, where you really start to get comfortable in your\nprofession, you’re taking that away from the entire generation. That’s only going to fuel\ntribalism, that’s only going to fuel [unintelligible]... That’s why to me, it’s incumbent upon\nfreedom-loving people to make sure that we sort out these governments and make sure\nthat we sort out particularly this crony capitalism so that the benefits become more of this\nentrepreneurial spirit and that can flow back to working-class and middle-class people.\nBecause if not, we’re going to pay a huge price for this.

We expect growth of 1.4% in CY2017 and 1.2% in\nCY2018, well above consensus of just 0.8% growth next year. For the first time in four\nyears both monetary and fiscal policy are supporting growth. The combination of\nmodestly higher commodity prices, a weaker yen, and a tightening output gap should\ndrive Japan-style core inflation to 1.0% in CY2017, and 1.4% in CY2018. We expect the\nBoJ to keep its rate targets unchanged for the foreseeable future as inflation moves in\nthe right direction.\nFiscal and monetary policy realigning\nFor years Japan has oscillated between loose and tight fiscal policy. Japanese\npolicymakers now seem to be on the same page and we see little risk of another policy\nerror. If anything, we see upside risks from greater fiscal stimulus via a third\nsupplementary budget or a relatively aggressive FY17 ordinary budget.

Specifically, 1) consumption is poised to rebound as the\nsaving rate peaks; 2) capex should accelerate in response to the improving demand\noutlook, deepening supply-side constraints, and “low-for-longer” real rates; and 3)\nincreased efforts by policymakers to accelerate income redistribution could push up the\nvelocity of money at the margin, helping to reflate the economy.\nUnauthorized redistribution of this report is prohibited. This report is intended for amanda.ens@baml.com\nBiggest risk factor: US policy uncertainty\nExternal developments pose the greatest risk to our forecasts, chief among them US\npolicy uncertainty. The downside scenario for Japan is a combination of rising US\nprotectionism, sliding global trade, and a stronger yen, which could reduce 2017 growth\nto zero. The Trump presidency may increase pressure on Japan to achieve greater\nmilitary self-reliance, boosting defense spending. There will also be greater incentives to\ndeepen economic and trade linkages with key regional players, such as China and Russia.\nChart 1: We think consensus is underestimating the strength of medium-term GDP and inflation\n2.0\n1.5\n1.0\n0.5\n0.0\n-0.5\nReal GDP %YoY\n0.7\n0.6\n1.4\nSource: BofA Merrill Lynch forecasts, Bloomberg\n1.2\n0.8 0.7\nCY16 CY17 CY18 CY16 CY17 CY18\nBofA Merrill Lynch does and seeks to do business with issuers covered in its research reports.

Growth accelerated to an aboveconsensus\n2.2% q-o-q saar, after a 0.7% rise in Q2 CY16 and 2.1% rise in Q1 CY16. We\nexpect a moderation in Q4 CY16, but underlying growth will remain firmly in the 1.0-\n1.5% range. We are currently tracking CY2016 growth of 0.7%, a modest improvement\nfrom 0.6% in CY2015, though the switch to a new GDP standard 1 next month raises\nuncertainty around our forecasts.\nUpturn in exports to be sustained through Q3 CY17\nThe recent recovery has been driven by a fading consumption tax shock and stronger\nexports. The downturn in the global industrial cycle in 2014-16 hurt Japan, but\nmanufacturing activity bottomed out early this year and is now modestly expanding\n(Chart 2). The OECD leading indicator continues to signal a synchronized pick-up in\nglobal growth (Chart 3). The domestic inventory cycle also points to production gains\nahead (Chart 4). For Japanese exporters, the improvement in demand has been most\nvisible for Europe (Chart 5). US and Chinese demand will likely follow, though the\nmainland’s structural shift to services implies only a modest acceleration. We expect the\ncurrent up-cycle in global exports to be sustained through Q3 CY17 – possibly longer\ndepending on developments in the US (more on this later).

There are good reasons to be cautiously optimistic: after all, despite a triple\nwhammy of weak domestic demand, weak commodity prices, and a stronger yen,\nJapanese inflation measures are showing early signs of bottoming out (Chart 6).\nWe expect Japan-style core inflation (CPI ex fresh food) to trough in Q4 CY16, after\nwhich it should accelerate relatively quickly in the first two quarters of 2017 in response\nto 1) a recovery in crude oil prices, 2) a weaker yen (we assume USDJPY rebounds to\n120 by the end of the year), and 3) stronger wage growth. This also implies stronger\ncore-core inflation (CPI ex food & energy). We are bullish on all three factors and see\nCY17 core inflation running at an above-consensus 1.0% and 1.4% in CY18.\nThis is still short of the central bank’s 2% target (Chart 7). But we believe there will be\nlittle pressure to lower rates further, especially against the backdrop of a weakening yen\nand rising global yields. More broadly, things are moving in the right direction for the\nBoJ. The private sector has been steadily re-leveraging, albeit gradually. Meanwhile,\nlabor markets continue to tighten and wage growth is slowly improving: the 4-quarter\nmoving average for hourly wages is now up to 1.2% y-o-y (Chart 8). With the labor\nmarket for lower-cost part-time workers nearing saturation, growth in higher-quality,\nfull-time jobs is picking up (Chart 9).

In August, the Cabinet approved\nan economic stimulus package totaling JPY28trn (roughly 5.5% of GDP). Though “real\nwater” government spending is a comparatively modest JPY7.5trn (1.5% of GDP), this is\nenough to put the fiscal impulse back in expansionary territory, after three years of\ntightening (Chart 10). The stimulus measures, which are centered on public investment\nand cash transfers to households, should boost CY2017 GDP by 0.5ppt. Public\nconstruction orders are already rebounding as the government front-loaded public\ninfrastructure spending (Chart 11). Meanwhile, the next stage of the consumption tax\nincrease has been postponed until October 2019.\nChart 10: After 3 years of tightening, fiscal policy to turn loose in FY17\n2.5\n2.0\n1.5\n1.0\n0.5\n0.0\n-0.5\n-1.0\nSource: BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research, IMF, CAO\nTo be clear, we are not talking about massive shifts in the fiscal stance here—the\nMinistry of Finance remains very much opposed to expanding the deficit and Prime\nMinister Abe has yet to abandon the government’s long-standing goal of balancing the\nprimary balance by FY2020.\nHowever, there is a growing consensus among Japanese policymakers that premature\nfiscal tightening is counter-productive for reflation efforts, especially when monetary\npolicy is stretched. Even BoJ Governor Kuroda, who initially underplayed the risks from\n2014 fiscal tightening, has recently acknowledged that loose monetary and fiscal\npolicies will have a “synergistic effect.” The upshot is that the risk of another policy\nerror is low, in our view. If anything, we see upside risks from greater fiscal stimulus in\nthe form of a third supplementary budget or relatively aggressive FY17 ordinary budget.\nWe would not rule out further delays to the October 2019 consumption tax hike, either.\nChart 11: Public investment is poised to pick up in the months ahead\n30\n20\n10\n0\n-10\nForecasts\nFY10 FY11 FY12 FY13 FY14 FY15 f FY16 f FY17 f\nFiscal impulse (change in cyclically-adjusted primary balance), % GDP\n-20\n2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016\nPublic construction orders received %YoY 3mma\nPublic construction orders completed %YoY 3mma\nContractionary\nExpansionary\nSource: BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research, MITI\n4 Japan Economics Viewpoint | 18 November 2016\n2017: a good year for domestic demand\nPolicy tailwinds are only one pillar of our call for Japan’s outperformance in 2017. We\nalso believe the stars are aligning for an organic improvement in domestic demand,\nwhich would support the current recovery: the economy is firing on all cylinders for the\nfirst time since 2013, and growth should accelerate to 1.4% in CY2017, followed by\n1.2% expansion in CY2018 (Chart 12).\nWe see three catalysts: a consumer comeback, stronger capex, and a shift in income\naway from high-saving corporations in favour of higher-spending households and\nstockholders.\nChart 12: Steady improvement in growth, led by domestic demand\n3.0\n2.0\n1.0\n0.0\n-1.0\nBofAMLForecasts\n-2.0\n2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018\nPrivate demand Public demand Net exports Real GDP growth %YoY\nSource: BofA Merrill Lynch forecasts, CAO\n1. Consumer comeback\nHouseholds have been the noticeable laggard in the current recovery and the main\nreason why Japan’s economy has barely grown since the 2014 consumption tax hike.\nThis is not for a lack of income growth: real employee compensation (wages +\nemployment) has staged an impressive recovery of late, rising 1.2% in CY15, and an\nestimated 1.9% in CY16 (Chart 13).\nOne explanation is that private consumption is simply being underestimated in demandside\nGDP statistics: researchers at the Bank of Japan recently produced experimental\nsupply-side estimates of GDP that were significantly higher than existing expenditureside\nstatistics. 2 We find the BoJ research interesting and agree that Japanese\nconsumption statistics are beset by data quality issues. But this alone cannot account\nfor the consumption slump. We think two factors are equally to blame for depressed\nhousehold spending: 1) a squeeze on disposable income from higher taxes and social\nsecurity contributions; and 2) a surge in the saving rate (Chart 14).\nCalling Japan right in 2017 is largely about correctly forecasting whether these two\ntrends will reverse. We see several reasons for optimism. First, we expect real employee\ncompensation to accelerate further, driven by a continued pick-up in per capita wages.\nThe call on the saving rate is admittedly trickier. But having surpassed the 2006 highs,\nwe think it is unlikely to surge further, given that consumer confidence is improving and\nincome growth is firming. FY17 tax reforms are also likely to support household\nsentiment at the margin: for example, discussions are underway about enlarging tax cuts\nfor second-earners who work part-time. Overall, we expect private consumption to rise\n1.0% in CY17, adding 0.6ppt to growth.\nShould the saving rate stabilize, as we expect, consumption should again start rising in\ntandem with compensation. Investors should not have to wait long to get some visibility\naround these trends. We expect the saving rate to peak in Q4 CY16 and consumption to\nrise strongly from this quarter.\n2\nLink to the research paper (in Japanese only):\nhttps://www.boj.or.jp/research/wps_rev/wps_2016/data/wp16j09.pdf\nJapan Economics Viewpoint | 18 November 2016 5\nChart 13: Real labor income and private consumption\nChart 14: Workers' saving rate at all-time high\n270\n265\n260\n255\n250\n245\n2005\n2006\n2007\n2008\n2009\n2010\n2011\n2012\n2013\n2014\n2015\n2016\n330\n320\n310\n300\n290\n280\n22\n20\n18\n16\n14\n12\n10\n1970\n1973\n1976\n1979\n1982\n1985\n1988\n1991\n1994\n1997\n2000\n2003\n2006\n2009\n2012\n2015\nReal employee compensation, JPY trn saar (LHS)\nPrivate consumption, JPY trn saar (RHS)\nSaving rate of workers' households, % 4qtr ma\nSource: BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research, CAO\nSource: BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research, MIA\n2. Capex revival\nWe also see a fundamental case for higher capital spending. Borrowing rates are very\nlow and will fall further in real terms as inflation rises. Stronger growth and improved\nconfidence should also encourage higher capex. And deepening supply-side constraints\noffer a strong incentive for Japan Inc. to accelerate productivity-enhancing capex,\nensuring that this expansion is durable.\nFor these reasons, we think that the impulse of capital expenditures will likely be higher\nin the non-manufacturing sector, where capacity utilization rates are higher, and labor\nshortages (and hence wage pressures) are more acute (Chart 15 and Chart 16).\nChart 15: Capacity utilization rates by sector\nChart 16: Labor shortages by sector\n-10\nInsufficient\n-40\nInsufficient\n0\n-20\n10\n0\n20\n20\n30\nExcess\n40\n2003 2005 2006 2007 2008 2010 2011 2012 2013 2015 2016\nBoJ Tankan production capacity - manufacturing, DI\nBoJ Tankan production capacity - non-manufacturing, DI\nSource: BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research, BoJ\n40\nExcess\n60\n2003 2005 2006 2007 2008 2010 2011 2012 2013 2015 2016\nBoJ Tankan employment conditions - manufacturing, DI\nBoJ Tankan employment conditions - non-manufacturing, DI\nSource: BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research, BoJ\nChart 17 shows the ratio of personnel costs to sales, using MoF corporate survey data.\nThe ratio is particularly high for lodging & accommodations (23%), eating & drinking\nservices (27%), medical, healthcare & welfare (37%) and education & learning support\n(37%). Somewhat surprisingly, personnel expenses are fairly restrained in retail. But this\nis partly due to the relatively heavy reliance on lower-cost part-time workers. Given the\nrapid growth in part-timers’ wages, such cost savings is likely to become increasingly\ndifficult to maintain.\n6 Japan Economics Viewpoint | 18 November 2016\nChart 17: Personnel costs to sales, % ratio 4qtr ma (as of Apr-Jun 2016)\n40\n35\n30\n25\n20\n15\n10\n5\n0\nSource: BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research, MoF\nAnalysis by METI suggests that many of these non-manufacturing industries have the\nscope to raise productivity. Wholesale/retail, utilities, and eating & accommodation have\nparticularly low levels of productivity relative to the US (Chart 18). We think the solution\nis to boost capex, especially in ICT and automation. More broadly, an acceleration in\ncapex is needed if we are to see a pick-up in productivity and sustained profits. Though\nwe are by no means in the late stages of the profit cycle, the trend clearly points to\nhigher wage costs going forward, requiring proactive efficiency-enhancing investment\nby corporates. Bottom-up data capex data for MSCI Japan also suggest that the\ninvestment cycle has troughed and will pick up next year as earnings momentum\nimproves (Chart 19).\nChart 18: Japan's labor productivity relative to the US: services is low\nChart 19: Capex – YoY change in Japan vs Global Earnings Revisions\n(2003-07)\n140\n120\n100\n80\n60\n40\n20\n0\nSource: BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research, METI\n3. Policy priorities and redistribution\nWe think an increase in government pressure on corporations could speed up income\nredistribution at the margin, ensuring that money circulates to those sectors and agents\nwith a higher propensity to consume. Elevated corporate savings remain a focal point\nfor the government. Cabinet Office officials have used the concept of the “cash-out\nratio” 3 to highlight the creaky transmission from corporate profits to spending.

The measure is defined as cash out / cash and deposits. The numerator\nincludes capex, personnel expenses, R&D, dividends, and changes in equity investments in related\ncompanies. The denominator includes cash and deposits, and securities, short-term lending, and\ninvestment securities classified under liquid assets. Since we are restricted to Ministry of Finance\nCorporate survey data, our version of the “cash-out ratio” is defined as capex + personnel costs +\ndividends / cash and liquid assets.\nJapan Economics Viewpoint | 18 November 2016 7\nshows that this measure has been on a steady downtrend, with the numbers particularly\nlow for large corporates.\nSo far, the government’s approach has relied more on carrots than sticks, with Prime\nMinister Abe using a combination of moral suasion and sweeteners to encourage firms\nto disgorge profits. The pattern has continued as we approach FY2017. For example,\nlocal media have reported that the government is considering offering corporate tax\nbreaks to SMEs that raise wages, in light of more modest wage growth at SMEs.\nDiscussions are also underway in the Prime Minister’s office about reforming working\npractices with the immediate focus on “Equal Pay for Equal work (EPEW)”—i.e. reducing\nthe wage gap between regular and non-regular employees.\nBut the issue is contentious from both a capital and labour perspective. And considering\nthe time it will likely take for related legislation to pass in the Diet, we think the lack of\ncompliance mechanisms may mean that the immediate impact of EPEW will be limited.\nInstead, the debate seems to have shifted towards limiting excessive and unproductive\novertime work. This is low-hanging fruit that does not address the issue of Japan’s\nlabour market rigidities, which are at the heart of the problem of suppressed wages and\nweak household spending power.\nThat said, there are signs that the government’s patience is wearing thin and that the\nPrime Minister is increasingly leaning towards direct intervention. For example, the\ngovernment has already delivered a minimum wage hike in FY2016 and plans to take the\nnational average up to JPY1,000 by 2020 via yearly hikes of 3%. These policy changes\nshould offer small tailwinds for the recovery in private consumption. We also think the\ndebate over a possible retained earnings tax is unlikely to go away. We are sceptical it\nwill be introduced in this year’s tax reforms. However, the government’s escalating war\non corporates hoarding cash is likely to lead to a continued rise in dividend payouts and\nshare buybacks (Chart 21).\nChart 20: Firms' cash-out ratio*, % 4qtr ma\n40%\n30%\n20%\n10%\nChart 21: Dividends and share buybacks by Japanese firms (TSE 1st\nsection listed)\n(JPY trn)\n20\n15\n10\n5\n0%\n1980 1985 1990 1995 2000 2005 2010 2015\nAll firm sizes Large firms Small firms\n0\nDividend\nShare buyback\nSource: BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research, MoF *The cash-out ratio is defined as personnel\nexpenses, capex, and dividend payouts as a share of cash and liquid asset balances\nSource: Nikkei Astra, BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research\nNote: FY2016 dividend is companies' guidance. FY2016 share buyback is estimated by annualizing\nthe YTD numbers as of November 2016\nRisk factors: largely from overseas\nA key risk to our 2017 outlook on the domestic side may be weaker-than-expected\ngrowth in real labor income, or a continued surge in the household saving rate, which\nwould constrain consumption.\nHowever, we think the biggest risks in either direction stem from abroad. Specifically,\nwe see higher uncertainty over global trade, risk sentiment, and FX as a result of\npolitical transitions in the US and Eurozone. We consider multiple policy scenarios under\na Trump presidency.\nTrump’s campaign promises have mixed implications for Japan. On a positive note\nderegulation, tax cuts, and aggressive infrastructure spending could boost US aggregate\n8 Japan Economics Viewpoint | 18 November 2016\ndemand. Our US economics team expects the stimulus to boost growth in H2 CY17 and\nlikely CY18. Japan should be a big winner from stronger US growth, given its high\nexposure to the US economy in terms of exports and corporate profits (Chart 22 and\nChart 23). On the negative side, aggressive protectionist trade measures, if\nimplemented, would depress US growth and global trade further. If combined with a\nstronger yen, Japan’s economy would be hit hard.\nChart 22: Japan's export exposure (% of total gross and value-added\nexports*)\n30\n25\n20\n15\n10\n5\n0\nSource: OECD\nUSA CHN KOR TWN GER\nGross exports\nValue-added basis\nChart 23: Breakdown of Japan exports to US by commodity, 2015\n6% 7%\n12%\n22%\n39%\n14%\nChemicals Manufactured goods Machinery\nElectrical Machinery Transport equipment Others\nSource: BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research, MoF\nBase case: “benign Trump” scenario\nFor the moment, we are assuming limited positive and negative policy changes. Our US\nteam expects uncertainty to cause a modest slowing of growth in the first half of next\nyear, but this will be more than offset by fiscal stimulus in the second half and into\n2018. But the size of the fiscal expansion will likely be smaller than promised, and the\nintroduction of modest protectionist measures means that the boost to global trade will\nessentially be zero. Table 1 shows the impact on growth under two scenarios, based on\ndifferent assumptions for global trade and FX. Under the upside case, Japan’s GDP could\nrebound towards 2%, as the economy benefits from a combination of stronger global\ntrade and a weak currency. Under a downside “protectionist” scenario, 2017 growth\nwould slow to around zero and would most likely tip Japan back into deflation.\nTable 1: Sensitivity of Japan's growth to global trade and foreign exchange rate\n(Assumptions) Baseline Case 1 - Upside Case 2 - Downside\nGlobal trade 0.0% 3.0% -10.0%\n% JPY appreciation (*) -7.0% -10.0% 10.0%\n(Simulation results) Change (Contribution) Change (Contribution) Change (Contribution)\n(**) (**) (**)\nReal GDP impact 0.2ppt - 0.9ppt - -1.4ppt -\nConsumption 0.0% (0.02ppt) 0.3% (0.15ppt) -0.8% (-0.44ppt)\nCapex 1.9% (0.26ppt) 2.9% (0.40ppt) -3.2% (-0.44ppt)\nNet Exports - (0.00ppt) - (0.30ppt) - (-0.23ppt)\nSource: BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research, CAO, MoF, IMF\n(*) Rate of appreciation of Japanese yen in terms of effective exchange rate\n(**) Contributions to the change in real GDP\nPolitical impact of a Trump administration\nFor Japan, the impact of Trump’s election goes beyond economic issues.

There is a lot of uncertainty as to how far Trump will go to redefine\nthe US-Japan alliance. Despite his criticism, Japan already pays about 75% of US\nmilitary hosting costs. However, it seems fair to assume that Japan will be expected to\nJapan Economics Viewpoint | 18 November 2016 9\nincrease its defense spending. Under Prime Minister Abe, the defense budget has\nexpanded by 7% but has been kept at roughly 1% of GDP, in keeping with historical\nguidelines. This is small by international standards and more likely than not will rise in\nthe coming years (Chart 24). The composition of spending is also likely to shift from\noperating costs towards procurement, which is currently a very small part of the budget\n(Chart 25).\nChart 24: Military spending % of GDP as of 2015—Japan's is low by int'l\nstandards\n6\n5\n4\nChart 25: Breakdown of Japan's defense-related expenditures\n100%\n50%\n3\n2\n1\n0\nJP UK AU CH FR KR US RU\nSource: BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research, World Bank\n0%\n2000\n2001\n2002\n2003\n2004\n2005\n2006\n2007\n2008\n2009\n2010\n2011\n2012\n2013\n2014\n2015\n2016\nJP R&D, facility development, maintenance etc.\nJP procurement of equipment\nJP personnel and food provisions\nU.S.Forces Japan-related cost\nSource: BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research, Ministry of Defense\nTPP and trade policy: potential for linkages with other regional players\nTrump and his aides have made it clear that they consider the Trans Pacific Partnership\n(TPP) to be a “bad deal.” Media have reported that President Obama is not considering\npushing the deal through a lame duck Congress. This means the deal is likely dead in its\ncurrent form.\nWhile negative for Japan, the expected withdrawal of the US from TPP could spur new\narrangements with regional partners. One potential positive is the prospect of improved\neconomic and trade linkages with other key players in the region, including Russia and\neven China. Three upcoming events are worth monitoring closely (Table 2): first, the 19-\n20 November APEC Summit in Lima, Peru, where we are likely to see vigorous\ndiscussions on the future of the TPP as well as further progress on the Regional\nComprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP); second, the 15 December Abe-Putin\nSummit, in Yamaguchi prefecture; and third a potential trilateral summit between Japan,\nChina, and Korea, which onshore media now say is being scheduled for 19-20 December,\nthough it may not happen given the unfolding leadership upheaval in Korea.\nBullish bottom line – don’t underestimate the recovery\nWe are optimistic on Japan and think the acceleration in GDP and inflation in 2017 will\nbe much stronger than consensus expects. For the first time since 2013, fiscal and\nmonetary policy will be lined up in the same expansionary direction. The global export\ncycle has turned and is now tracking modest expansion.

I am currently on a plane until noon pacific time, and then\nheading to a meeting right after landing, till about 2 pm or so. While Iam running the risk that you will report\nmy comments, if you do, either out of context, or incompletely, I am responding with an effort to be complete,\nas I always try and do with reporters. If you decide to go ahead with a story, which, after reading my responses,\nI hope you decide is inappropriate, I would like you to quote my responses fully in order not to distort them.\n\nIt is hard to know how to respond to a list of false and/or distorted allegations, along with misleading\nstatements. I treat people I interact with with respect, and I work hard to support and mentor students,\ncolleagues, and members of the general public, and this is supported by the institutions of which Iam a part. I\ndo not sexually harass people. If the purpose of your reporting is to somehow argue that Universities and other\ninstitutions are lax in dealing with well known individuals like myself, then in fact the situation is quite the\nopposite. My high public profile opens me up to more scrutiny at these institutions, not less, and it also opens\nme up to a host of unfounded outside complaints and allegations that other faculty do not receive, each of which\nthe University has to respond to. The fact that I have remained a professor in all Universities with which I have\nbeen associated, in good standing, and also an officer or an invited speaker at organizations like CFI, which\nhave strict harassment policies, is a confirmation of the fact that their experience validates a trust in my\nbehavior. I was asked to be an honorary director of CFI, and continue to be invited to their last 3 meetings to\nspeak, specifically because, as they have written me after the fact, the attendees universally appreciated my\ntalks, my courtesy, and graciousness in spending time with the attendees. Ifthe purpose of your report is to\nimpugn my integrity or suggest I have a history of harassment, that too is false. As noted in one of your\n‘miscellaneous facts’, as a scientist I try and remain skeptical, and rely on empirical evidence, rather than\nallegations and innuendo by people whose motives I cannot judge. I also try and judge the facts in context. The\nfact that Universities and other organizations employ me or have me on their boards, or invite me to meetings is\nbecause they value my contributions and my actions.\n\nThe items you list are false or distorted. Item 1 refers to a consensual encounter in my hotel room in 2006 where\nwe mutually decided, in a polite discussion in fact, that taking it any further would not be appropriate, and there\nwere respectful and platonic encounters afterwards. There is nothing to comment on in item 3, which involves\nan anonymous 3rd party claim because I know nothing about it, there are no details provided, and it clearly was\nnot taken seriously enough to result in any university action. Item 4 is confusing. Are you saying that because I\ndecided I didn’t want to go out to a bar with a group of attendees that I was harassing them? The second part\ndid not happen. Re incident 5: The ‘female companion’ in this case is my wife, who accompanied me on the\ncruise, and has attested to the fact that the claim is false. This is what I wrote at the time in response to the blog\nin question, causing it to be taken down.\n\nIt is worth responding to Item 2 and 6 in more detail,\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_031270\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

The couple married and moved to Australia, where they currently live.\n\nIn 2007 — at the same time the FBI was investigating Epstein — Roberts, pregnant with her second child, said she unexpectedly received phone calls from\nMaxwell and Epstein. She said they were worried that she had told police about them. She assured them she had not spoken to anyone, she said.\n\nShortly afterward, Roberts said, she was contacted by someone who claimed to be with the FBI. But she was afraid to tell that person details, fearing it was\nreally an Epstein associate posing as an FBI agent.\n\nThat agent, identified in court papers as Timothy Slater, confirmed that he and the other agent on the case, Nesbitt Kuyrkendall, called Roberts in January\nor February 2007. Ina sworn statement, Slater said he informed Roberts that they suspected she was a victim of Epstein’s.\n\nThe agent said Roberts answered basic questions, but became uncomfortable and “asked that I not bother her again.”\n\nRoberts said the agent didn’t try too hard to convince her to talk, and she was surprised when he hung up after asking her a few graphic questions about\nher sex life. She said she was suspicious, but would have cooperated had the FBI talked to her in person and explained why they were asking about\nEpstein.\n\n“T was still scared to death,”’ Roberts said. “Jeffrey used to tell me that he owned the entire Palm Beach Police Department. I just didn’t want my family\nharmed.”\n\nShe nevertheless was listed by federal prosecutors as one of Epstein’s Palm Beach victims.\n\nAs the years went by and Roberts had a daughter, she would be haunted by a fear that Epstein was still taking advantage of young girls. In 2011, she went\npublic in a paid interview with a British tabloid, the Daily Mail, asserting that she had had sex with Prince Andrew, one of Epstein’s friends, several times\nwhen she was a teen.\n\nIn her 2015 affidavit, she discussed in detail some of her alleged sex encounters with the prince and Epstein’s other friends, including lawyer Alan\nDershowitz. Edwards included the affidavit in the court file as part of the Jane Does’ Crime Victims’ Rights Act case, at which time it became public.\n\nVirginia Roberts says she was loaned out by Jeffrey Epstein to his friend Prince Andrew, shown here. He denies they had sex.

How do you respond to the unfair and hateful rumors that Dubai has turned into\na ghost city?\n\nThe performance of our economy in the first quarter of this year proves that we are on the way out of the crisis,\nand that we are on the right track. Our economy will resume its health faster than other economies, but the\nspeed of that=2 Oresumption is not governed only by the strength of our economy and its abundant resources.\nThe speed will also be influenced by developments in the international economy — including the measures of\nrevival in the grouping of industrialized states known as the G-20, whose role in international trade movement\nis about 90 percent of the total international trade, and whose GDP is about 60 percent of the entire world GDP.\nThe speed of general recovery will also be influenced by the capability of international measures connected\nwith monitoring markets, and the role, functions and work mechanisms of international financial institutions,\nespecially the International Monetary Fund. I am optimistic that good implementation of the decisions of G-20\nand the International Monetary Fund will speed up the recovery of the global economy.\n\nBy Ali Mutalq Al-Quhais Al-Shammari - AlReyadh Newspaper\n\nSometime ago, several Western papers published unfair reports about the UAE, claiming\nhuman right violations of foreign labor in the UAE, and the lack of free elections in the\nUAE, etc. What do you think of these allegations? What do you think is the reason behind\nspreading such malicious reports?\n\nThey may write whatever they like, and play the tunes that please them. We are not annoyed by criticism, nor\ndo we fear campaigns. They have their models, experience, values, standards, their cultural and intellectual\nframes of references. We have our models, values, st andards and frames of references. We are open to the\nentire human experience in every field. We learn from them, but we will never import ready-made models. We\ndo not accept that, and our society does not accept this. As for the allegations about foreign labor, it is an old\ntheme, repeated every now and then. Yes, certain sectors of foreign labor are not in the state we like or hope.\nBut we are steadily improving that state, and we are making progress every year. For years, the talk about\nforeign labor has not ceased. Such talk is open to all and to the countries that provide such labor. Despite that,\nmillions are trying to come to work in our country. So, why do those foreign countries don’t stop their citizens\nfrom coming to work in the UAE if the work situation is such as these nasty reports claim?\n\nBy Al Emarat Al Youm\n\nThe UAE is facing a regional and global media campaign that questions its ability to\novercome the global financial crisis. How does Your Highness evaluate such campaigns?\nWhat are the tools and the initiatives with which to respond, including the development\nof local media?\n\nAction is louder than words. Our achievements and hard work would be the response to these campaigns. The\nUAE is immune to such campaigns, and questioning of its ability to continue developing a strong federation is\nnot going to yield anything. When we established the UAE federation, we faced analysis and speculation\ncampaigns, questioning our ability to sustain the Federation and ensure its success. Similarly, the launch of\nevery major project was met with uncertainty and rumors from media campaigns.

Dan Shomron was now head of the southern command and had told\nme, before we headed back from California, that he’d recommended me for the\npost. It was an especially exciting prospect because the US-backed negotiations\nwith Egypt did finally appear to be nearing an agreement. As commander of\nDivision 252, I’d be coordinating and implementing Israel’s Sinai withdrawal.\n\nBut I didn’t get the job, at least not on my return. Raful Eitan had indeed\nsucceeded Motta as chief of staff, and he had the final say. I'd evidently been\nright to assume I would figure no higher in his estimation than I had as sayeret\ncommander. To be fair, however, he did agree to my becoming commander of\nDan’s reserve division in the south: the same 611\" that Arik Sharon had led\nacross the canal in 1973. When I took up that post in April 1979 — just days\nafter the formal Israeli-Egyptian peace treaty was indeed signed — I was also\npromoted. I became a one-star general. And eighteen months later, when the\nregular division post came open again, I did get the nod to command the 252™\".\n\nEven then, it was a close-run thing. Raful called me in to see him and said he\nwanted me to return to the kirya instead, in the one-star general’s post inside\nmilitary intelligence. He said he had more than enough candidates for division\ncommander, but that my previous experience meant I was the best choice for the\nintelligence post. I was determined to remain in the field, especially with signs\nthat Begin, and certainly his more right-wing supports in the Likud, were\nalready having second thoughts about the peace deal we’d struck with Egypt. In\npart, they feared that a withdrawal from any of the land taken in the 1967 war\nmight create a precedent, and invite pressure, for more withdrawals. But the real\nbuyers’ remorse centered on the fact that, as part of the initial agreement at\nCamp David, Begin had needed to accept a parallel framework for negotiations\ntoward a broader peace that would include the West Bank and Gaza\nPalestinians.\n\nIn any case, with Raful balking a second time at giving me the division\ncommand, | figured I had little to lose by fightinhg my corner, and telling him\nexactly what I felt. “Look, I realize that you’re chief of staff,” I said. “But don’t\nforget we’re both just temporarily in whatever role we hold. I’m not here as a\ndraftee. I’m in the army by choice. It’s your decision to tell me what position\nyou want me to take. But you can’t impose anything. I can always leave. Or I\ncan bide my time until you leave.” Raful apparently concluded he couldn’t\nactually force me to take the intelligence job. With Dan having made his\npreference clear, he didn’t press the point.\n\n188\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_011659\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

Though we didn’t go into the details of the Iranian nuclear\nthreat, he did talk at some length about the implications for the region, and about\nbroader Middle Eastern security challenges. He displayed a grasp of the cultural\nand political nuances of an increasingly diverse and complex world that was more\nimpressive than many of the other American political or military leaders whom I’d\nmet.\n\nWhen he and I now returned to the issue of Iran, in the White House, he had an\nundeniable command of the details of Iran’s nuclear program, and of the American\nmilitary options, should he choose to use them. He opened by summarizing the US\nposition. He emphasized that his and our objective was the same: the keep Iran\nfrom developing a nuclear weapon. We were already cooperating to achieve that,\nfor instance through cyber-attacks to slow down the nuclear program. The\ndifference, he said, was that Israeli leaders seemed to feel an urgent need to reach a\ndecision on military action. In Obama’s view, such a move would be both\npremature and potentially harmful to the coalition he’d helped assemble to exert\ndiplomatic and economic pressure on Iran.\n\nMaybe you had to be an Israeli truly to understand our urgency about Iran. In\nthe early years of the state, the explanation we gave for our preoccupation with\nsecurity — our near-obsession, as some non-Israelis saw it — was that we were\nsurrounded by Arab countries pledged not just to defeat us, but erase us from the\nmap. Egypt or Syria, Jordan or Iraq, could afford to lose an Arab-Israeli war.\nIsrael’s first defeat, however, would be its last. That picture had changed\ndramatically over the decades. We no longer had to worry about the prospect of\nlosing a war. The “qualitative edge” we possessed over all enemy armies in the\nregion ensured that. As Israel’s chief of staff, Prime Minister, and now Defense\nMinister, I had made it a major priority to safeguard that advantage, not just\nthrough our alliance with the US but with the remarkable domestic resources we\npossessed in military engineering, manufacturing, design, invention and high-tech.\nBut the new-order challenge represented by Iran was not just theoretical or\nacademic. Though we had a policy of not commenting on on our own nuclear\nstatus, it was widely assumed in the Arab world and internationally that Israel had,\nat the very least, the capacity to manufacture nuclear weapons. But whatever\nnuclear capability we might possess was for deterrence.

I am fully aware that some financial and economic circles were not happy\nwith the progress we managed to achieve on various tracks including investment, aviation industry, IT and\nglobal competition in mana ging and financial markets.\n\nThe UAE has proven remarkable competency in addressing difficult questions imposed by the global financial\ncrisis. I strongly believe it won’t be long before international focus will shift from what is claimed to be\nDubai’s shortcomings to Dubai’s and the UAE’s overall success in passing this difficult test.\n\nBy Al-Sharq al-Awsat Daily\n\nAlmost a year ago, and during your visit to Asia, you warned against the global financial\ncrisis. Why precautionary measures have not been undertaken to avoid negative impacts\nof this crisis on both Dubai and UAE?\n\nThe crisis have taken the whole world by surprise and evolved in tremendous pace. During my visit to Asia, I\nhad warned against turmoil in financial and commodities markets, marginalizing the role of international\nfinancial institutions and potentials that these institutions fall short from fulfilling their expected roles ina\nworld where all international markets became very much related, turning into one huge global market which\ndoes not follow any international rules, regulations or supervision.\n\nI had urged leading world economies to move swiftly and reconsider roles and mechanisms of international\nfinancial establishments and institutions, especially the International Monetary Fund -- and that what exactly\nthe G20 summit did last month earlier this month.\n\nRegarding the precautionary measures, I believe that no preventive measures neither i1n the UAE or any other\ncountry in the world, would have provided the desired immunity from the ramifications of the global financial\nmeltdown. The UAE’s solid economic structure, efficient performing establishments, adoption of a balanced\nmodel of conservative banking policies overseen by the Federal Central Bank and liberal economic approach,\nwere the key elements that enhanced the country’s ability to survive the negative implications of the global\ncrisis and prevented any case of bankruptcy in any of the country’s banks or major corporations. The impact of\nthe crisis on our economy was significant during the last quarter of 2008, yet it was not as harsh as on other\nmajor economies.\n\nBy Al-Sharq al-Awsat Daily\n\nDespite Dubai government officials repeated rebuffs of bailing out some companies to\nAbu Dhabi, speculations in that regard have never stopped. Isn’t normal for the\nEmirates to cooperate among themselves to overcome such difficult times?\n\nCooperation among the seven Emirates has never stopped and they don’t wait for crises to show this\ncooperation. There are several joint ventures between Abu Dhabi and Dubai. Founders and stakeholders of\nmost of the UAE Public Joint Stock companies are from Dubai and Abu Dhabi. Abu Dhabi investors have huge\ninvestments in Dubai and vice versa. Dubai has always welcomed business and investments from across the\nUAE.\n\nRegarding the speculations you referred to in your question, they will always remain just speculations. I believe\nthey are meant to be evil gossip as part of a vicious campaign against Dubai model. These speculations were not\nonly refuted by Dubai government officials but also by His Highness the President of the UAE last March.\n\nBy Al-Sharq al-Awsat Daily\n\nDo you believe that the UAE economy will contract this year?

Defensives outperformed cyclicals (Chart 1), growth outperformed value\n(Chart 2), and stocks that benefit from a low-yield environment (REITs) outperformed\nthe converse (banks, insurance; Chart 3). However, we expect conditions to reverse into\n2017. We see US Treasury yields rising and Japanese core CPI inflation recovering to\n+1.4% yoy by 2018 and core-core to +1.1% yoy. Stronger inflation and higher foreign\nyields should steepen the JGB yield curve above10yr, while below 10yr should escape\nfrom downward pressure as BoJ rate cut expectations recede. Against this backdrop, we\nexpect to see a rotation from deflation to inflation stocks, which in addition to cyclicals\nmeans banks and insurance should outperform REITs within the financial sector (Chart 3).\nThis is also in line with the global rotation expected by Michael Hartnett (The Flow\nShow: The Inflation Era Begins 10 November 2016).\n3) Nikkei winner of steeper UST and strong macro\nIn a scenario of strong external demand and US rate hikes (particularly with curve\nsteepening), Japan equities tend to be the winner on a local currency basis, led by\ncyclicals, banks and insurance stocks (Exhibit 4). Resurgence in the “Japan macro trade”\nof short yen / buy equities is also a possibility.\nOur Buy-rated stocks in bank, insurance and cyclical sectors are listed in Table 1.\n>> Employed by a non-US affiliate of MLPF&S and is not registered/qualified as a research analyst under\nthe FINRA rules.\nRefer to \"Other Important Disclosures\" for information on certain BofA Merrill Lynch entities that take\nresponsibility for this report in particular jurisdictions.\nBofA Merrill Lynch does and seeks to do business with issuers covered in its research reports.

The likelihood of\nagreement on the TPP (Trans-Pacific Partnership) has already declined and been priced\ninto the market, but any downward spiral in Japan-US relations would likely be further\nnegative for Japan equities near-term. A rise in protectionism would be negative for\nstocks with high US export exposure. Meanwhile if the US economy slows or enters\nrecession and the protectionist response weakens USD, it would be negative for\nJapanese cyclicals, particularly exporters, due to stronger JPY and potential trade\nconflicts. Moreover, a potential improvement in US-Russia (US-China) relations under\nthe new US President most likely implies a relative worsening in Japan-Russia (Japan-\nChina) relations. On the other hand, we expect Japan to move closer to Europe under\nsuch a scenario, raising the incentive to sign the Japan-EU EPA (Economic Partner\nAgreement), positive for related stocks. If the Trump presidency tips the US towards\nisolationism, we expect Japan’s spending on defense to increase. If this results in higher\nspending on Japan’s Self Defense Forces (rather than compensating for US spending on\nJapan-based US military), Japan’s defense-related stocks would be beneficiaries, and it\ncould reshape the arms industry in Japan.\nChart 1: Sector rotation and inventory cycle\n130.0\n40\n125.0\n120.0\n30\n115.0\n20\n110.0\n10\n105.0\n100.0\n0\n95.0\n-10\n90.0\n85.0 Cyclical Fundamental Defensive Cyclical Fundamental Defensive\n-20\nCyclical\n80.0\n-30\nJan-09 Jan-11 Jan-13 Jan-15\nIndustrial production - inventory (3m mva yoy%)\nMSCI Japan cyclical/defensive\nSource: BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research, Bloomberg, Haver\nCyclical = Industrials, consumer discretionary, IT, materials\nDefensive = Healthcare, telecom, consumer staples, utilities\nCalculated cyclical and defensive % change using monthly index return and index weight\nChart 2: Japan – High Beta PB vs. Low Beta PB\nHigh Beta PB / Low Beta PB\n2.0\n1.8\n1.6\n1.4\n1.2\n1.0\n0.8\n0.6\n0.4\n0.2\n90 91 92 93 94 95 96 97 98 99 00 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 08 09 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17\nSource: BofA Merrill Lynch Global Quantitative Strategy, MSCI, IBES\nGlobal Quant Panorama: Surf for longer 14 November 2016\n2 Japan Investment Strategy | 18 November 2016\nExhibit 3: Sector rotation and inventory cycle\nSlowdown\nInventory\nExpansion\n8\nDefensives\n6\nJune '12\nJune '15 4\n2\nJune '14\nFundamentals\nProduction\n0\n(8) (6) (4) (2) 0 2 4 6 8 10\n(2)\nSep '16\nJune '13 (4)\nChart 3: Higher inflation/yields suggests banks will outperform REITs\n2.3\n2.1\n1.9\n1.7\n1.5\n1.3\n1.1\n0.9\n0.7\n0.5\nContraction\nCyclicals\n(6)\nRecovery\nTSE Bank/ TSE REIT\nSource: BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research, Bloomberg,\nSource: BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research, Bloomberg, Haver\nExhibit 4: Reactions to US Treasury curve moves (%, simple average of past 43 quarters) – Japan equities have outperformed during bear-steepening led by\ncyclicals, banks and insurance\n12\n10\n8\n6\n4\n2\n0\n-2\n-4\n-6\n-8\n-10\n-12\nUSDJPY DXY MSCI JP MSCI JP /\nex JP\nJapan Sector = cyclical outperform on\nUST bear-steepening\nDiscretionary Financials Materials IT Industrials Energy Telecom Staples Utilities Health care\nBear steep Bear flat Bull steep Bull flat\nSource: BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research, Bloomberg.\nCurve movements based on 2yr move and 2s10s move (Bloomberg US Treasury yield index), so includes twist movements, but even if we exclude these implications do not materially change.\nBear steepening (2yr + 16bps, 2s10s +33bps) = 11 quarters, bear flattening (2yr +26bps, 2s10s -20bps) = 10 quarters, bull steepening (2yr -48bps, 2s10s +28bps) = 10 quarters, bull flattening (2yr -27bps, 2s10s -30bps) =\n12 quarters\nJapan Investment Strategy | 18 November 2016 3\nTable 1: Shares rated buy by our analysts in cyclical, bank and insurance sectors*\nCompany Name Ticker Industry (JPX definition) Price\nMKT CAP\n(Billion Yen)\nAnalyst Name\nMitsubishi UFJ FG 8306 JP Banks 683 9,674 Futoshi Sasaki\nJapan Post Bank 7182 JP Banks 1331 5,990 Futoshi Sasaki\nSMFG 8316 JP Banks 4190 5,925 Futoshi Sasaki\nResona HD 8308 JP Banks 538 1,251 Futoshi Sasaki\nMitsubishi Elec 6503 JP Electric Appliances 1592 3,418 Mikio Hirakawa\nNidec 6594 JP Electric Appliances 10460 3,035 Masashi Kubota\nHitachi 6501 JP Electric Appliances 588 2,658 Mikio Hirakawa\nPanasonic 6752 JP Electric Appliances 1033 2,533 Mikio Hirakawa\nDai-ichi Life 8750 JP Insurance 1850 2,202 Futoshi Sasaki\nMS&AD Holdings 8725 JP Insurance 3405 2,085 Futoshi Sasaki\nSompo Holdings 8630 JP Insurance 3684 1,506 Futoshi Sasaki\nShin-Etsu Chem 4063 JP Chemicals 8328 3,599 Takashi Enomoto\nFUJIFILM 4901 JP Chemicals 4095 1,906 Hiroyasu Eguchi\nSony 6758 JP Electric Appliances 3226 4,075 Mikio Hirakawa\nNTT DATA 9613 JP Information & Communication 5530 1,551 Hiroyasu Eguchi\nNSSMC 5401 JP Iron & Steel 2384 2,266 Takashi Enomoto\nJR East 9020 JP Land Transportation 9542 3,743 Yasuhito Tsuchiya\nJR Central 9022 JP Land Transportation 17825 3,672 Yasuhito Tsuchiya\nNintendo 7974 JP Other Products 26050 3,129 Hiroyasu Eguchi\nRecruit HD 6098 JP Services 4340 2,453 Yoshiyuki Kinoshita\nOriental Land 4661 JP Services 5957 1,991 Rie Sakai\nFuji Heavy Ind 7270 JP Transportation Equipment 4320 3,371 Kei Nihonyanagi\nSuzuki Motor 7269 JP Transportation Equipment 3711 1,637 Kei Nihonyanagi\nSource: BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research\n*Cyclical sectors = Industrials, consumer discretionary, IT, materials in GICS definition\n*Market cap above 1.5trn JPY except bank, insurance shares\n*Exclude Fast Retailing\n4 Japan Investment Strategy | 18 November 2016\nDisclosures\nImportant Disclosures\nFUNDAMENTAL EQUITY OPINION KEY: Opinions include a Volatility Risk Rating, an Investment Rating and an Income Rating. VOLATILITY RISK RATINGS, indicators of potential\nprice fluctuation, are: A - Low, B - Medium and C - High. INVESTMENT RATINGS reflect the analyst’s assessment of a stock’s: (i) absolute total return potential and (ii)\nattractiveness for investment relative to other stocks within its Coverage Cluster (defined below). There are three investment ratings: 1 - Buy stocks are expected to have a total\nreturn of at least 10% and are the most attractive stocks in the coverage cluster; 2 - Neutral stocks are expected to remain flat or increase in value and are less attractive than\nBuy rated stocks and 3 - Underperform stocks are the least attractive stocks in a coverage cluster. Analysts assign investment ratings considering, among other things, the 0-12\nmonth total return expectation for a stock and the firm’s guidelines for ratings dispersions (shown in the table below). The current price objective for a stock should be\nreferenced to better understand the total return expectation at any given time. The price objective reflects the analyst’s view of the potential price appreciation (depreciation).\nInvestment rating Total return expectation (within 12-month period of date of initial rating) Ratings dispersion guidelines for coverage cluster*\nBuy ≥ 10% ≤ 70%\nNeutral ≥ 0% ≤ 30%\nUnderperform N/A ≥ 20%\n* Ratings dispersions may vary from time to time where BofA Merrill Lynch Research believes it better reflects the investment prospects of stocks in a Coverage Cluster.\nINCOME RATINGS, indicators of potential cash dividends, are: 7 - same/higher (dividend considered to be secure), 8 - same/lower (dividend not considered to be secure) and 9 - pays\nno cash dividend.

If we are thinking about an evolved psychology for bonding\nwith members of our own group and fighting those outside, our ancestors would have been blind to race\nas it was not yet an emergent property of our species. Language was, however, a property of our species,\nand one that varied across populations. A hunter-gatherer walking the plains of South Africa would\nindeed have run into people speaking either a completely different language, or the same language with a\ndifferent dialect. New languages are not easily acquired, and nor are new dialects. It takes real talent to\nspeak a new language or dialect without a trace of ones origins. Thus, like the stotting gazelles,\nmagnanimous spenders, and healthy evildoers discussed in chapter 2, the native languages and dialects we\nspeak are honest signals of social group membership. Honesty is supported by the costs we pay to\nacquire them. Cheating is hard because there is a start-up cost associated with perfecting the natural\nrhythm of a second language or novel dialect.\n\nThe babies in Kinzler’s experiments tell us something important: race and language are both\nimportant social categories and discriminable from an early age. But language trumps race as a feature\nbecause it is a better predictor of membership within the inner sanctum, at least early in life. Ultimately,\nboth language and race allow us to close off some from the inner sanctum and allow others in. Ultimately,\nour allegiance to our native language and race can fuel our hatred toward those who look different and\n\nspeak in different tongues.\n\nClosed doors\nAs adults, we tend to rely on rules of thumb to guide our social interactions, including who we trust and\nwho we distrust. We tend to trust those we know more than those we don’t know. Within the circle of\nthose we know, we believe those who are more like us than those who are unlike us, using fixed body\nfeatures — race, height, hair color — flexible psychological features — food preferences, sports’\ninterests, religious beliefs — and features that are flexibly constrained — language and intelligence.\nTogether, these different dimensions cause us to close the door on some and open it to others.\nLanguage is particularly interesting. If you can’t understand someone because they don’t speak\nyour language or because their accent is too heavy, then the issue is not trust, but comprehension. But\nwhat if you can understand the person perfectly well, but they speak with a foreign accent, either one\nfrom a different country (e.g., a French speaker speaking English) or one from the same country but a\n\ndifferent region (e.g., a Southern accent in the northeast of the United States)?\n\nHauser Chapter 3.

A statement posted on\nn the Wikileaks web site and signed “Edward Snowden,” after thanking “friends new and old” for\nhis “continued liberty,” accused President Obama of pressuring “leaders of nations from which I\nhave requested protection to deny my asylum petitions. It added: “This kind of deception from a\nworld leader is not justice, and neither is the extralegal penalty of exile. These are the old, bad\ntools of political aggression.” Since the Aeroflot flight to Cuba was the only means of getting\ndirectly from Moscow to Latin America, Russian reporters, encouraged by the Wikileaks post,\ncontinued taking the daily 11 hour flight to Cuba until August 1, 2013, The charade only ended\nwhen Kucherena said in a press conference at the airport that Snowden would be taking up\nresidency at an undisclosed location in Moscow, and walked out of the airport with Snowden.\n\nThe question remained: where had Snowden been staying for those 39 days? Sarah Harrison,\n\nhis companion on the plane, told Vogue that she and Snowden had shared a windowless room in\nthe transit zone, where they watched TV, washed their clothes in a sink basin and ate meals from\nthe nearby Burger King. The only hotel with windowless rooms in the transit zone in 2013 was\nthe Vozdushny V-Express Capsule Hotel, located next to a newly-opened Burger King restaurant.\n\nI next went there. The polite V-express desk clerk, who spoke English, showed me the standard\nwindowless double-room. It was approximately 24 square feet, the size of a large shipping\ncontainer. Most of the floor space was taken up by twin bed. Across from the bed, behind a\nplastic curtain, was a stall with a shower, a toilet and sink. Not only was it very cramped quarters\nfor two people to share but it was fairly expensive. It cost 850 rubles an hour (about $18 in\n2013.) For 39 days that hourly charge would add up to $16,600. Even though Snowden claimed\nthat he brought a large cache of cash to Russia, such a long stay was not allowed, according to\nthe desk clerk. The maximum stay allowed by the hotel was 24 hours. So either the rule was\nwaived for Snowden or he moved to another facility not available to the public.\n\nI learned from a former KGB officer, there are a number of VIP quarters beyond the confines\nof the airport, including suites at the 400-room Novotel hotel, which is located about seven miles\nfrom the airport, that are used for debriefing and other purposes by the security services.\nAccording to him, the security services are not restricted from entering and leaving the transit\nzone.\n\nThe possibility that he was staying elsewhere would help explain the futile search for him by\nof a large number of reporters over those 39 days. When they learned from tweets that Snowden\nwas not aboard plane to Havana on June 24\", they aggressively questioned every restaurant\nemployees, security guards and airport personnel for weeks they could find. Some reporters even\ntook rooms in the V-Express Capsule Hotel and “tipped” maids and other hotel employees. They\nalso bought business-class tickets on flights to gain access to all the public VIP lounges in the\ntransit zones.

As a real estate investor,\n\nCohen is “cautious, methodical, smart and, I think,\nconservative,” Guarino says.\n\nCohen's current business partners are a family of New York\n\nreal estate lawyers headed by Herbert Chaves. The family, having\njust sold a plot of Brooklyn land to a partnership including the\nfamily company of Jared Kushner, were looking to reinvest their\n\ngains when they bought Cohen’s Lower Manhattan buildings in\n\n2014. Months later, they partnered with Cohen to buy the Upper\nEast Side property, 330 East 63rd Street. Guarino, a broker on\nthe deal, says he dealt only with Cohen, who served as a\nrepresentative for the investor group even though the Chaves\nfamily companies hold the majority stake.\n\nPurchased for $58 million, the squat, brown-brick seven-\n\nstory building has only a $17 million mortgage, meaning Cohen's\n\nshare has at least $15 million of equity he could borrow against\nif his partners allowed him to do so. Another property at 133\nAvenue D, not previously reported to be owned by Cohen, has at\nleast $5 million of equity not tapped by a mortgage. But more\ndebt means more risk and could hurt Cohen later if the taxi\n\nbusiness doesn’t turn around to help cover higher interest\npayments.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_020438\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

COURTESY OF VIRGINIA ROBERTS\n\nThat summer, when Roberts was 16, she said her father helped her get a job as a locker room attendant at the spa at Donald Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort in\nPalm Beach, records show. Her father worked at the resort as a maintenance man.\n\nThere she said she met Ghislaine Maxwell, an Epstein friend and socialite daughter of the late British publishing magnate Robert Maxwell. She offered\nRoberts an opportunity to become a massage therapist, working for Epstein.\n\nIn a sworn court affidavit and in a recent interview with the Herald, Roberts described how Epstein and Maxwell began grooming her — not just to\nperform massages, but to sexually pleasure them and others.\n\n“Tt started with one and it trickled into two and so on,” Roberts told the Herald. “And before you know it, I’m being lent out to politicians and academics\nand royalty.”\n\nRoberts, too, was ordered to find Epstein girls — the younger, the better — by trolling areas where teenagers congregated, such as shopping malls, to lure\ngirls to whatever residence Epstein was staying in at the time, she told the Herald.\n\nShe began to travel with Epstein and Maxwell to Epstein’s other homes, in New York, New Mexico and the U.S. Virgin Islands — and her trips are\ndocumented in flight logs that frequently list her name or her initials as a passenger, court records show.\n\n“His appetite was insatiable. He wanted new girls, fresh, young faces every single day — that was just the sickness that he had,” Roberts said.\nNeither Epstein nor his lead attorney, Goldberger, responded to requests for comment.\n\nRoberts alleges that Epstein had cameras throughout his homes and said he liked her to tell him about the sexual peccadilloes of various important men\nshe had sex with.\n\n“Epstein and Maxwell also got girls for Epstein’s friends and acquaintances. Epstein specifically told me that the reason for him doing this was so that\nthey would ‘owe him,’ they would ‘be in his pocket,’ and he would ‘have something on them,’ ” Roberts said in a court affidavit. “I understood him to\n\nhttps://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/article2 19494920 html 4/3/2019\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_017805\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

Twenty\nyears later, when an event occurred on the field, I noticed that we said\nexactly the same thing at the same time. “Oof,” “oh come on,” “ugh.”\nWhatever event on the field caused me to exclaim something, caused\nmy son to exclaim the same thing.

Perhaps we just need\nto watch our teachers and then we can copy what they do. Well, not\nexactly.\n\nI took a yoga lesson the other day. The instructor got into a pose\nand said I was to copy what he did. I said there wasn’t a chance that\nI could copy what he did.

In fact, the routes to\ncooperation are rarely easy in any age. They involve overcoming old bureaucratic\nideas, deeply held instincts of national interest, broken and humid and sometimes\nmurderous psychological needs - all while accepting a new picture of power - and\nfresh risks and responsibilities. Our problem now, even in the face of these snapping\ntraps, is to define a clear vision of our future security - and then to make a path to\nget there.

In the long run, relations create actors.” 7? The nouns we worry\nabout now, and the ones we hope for, take their meaning and their risk and energy\nfrom relations. Your genome connected is different and more hopeful than it is\nalone, unplugged, slipping into cancer. This idea that relations create actors is a\npowerful basis for a new, enduring - even decent - grand strategy for an age of\nrevolutionary connection. It should also offer a check against some of our horrible\nmiscalculations: America invaded Iraq, for instance, intending to replace one state\nwith another. Instead we replaced a state with a network - and not one that we\ncontrolled. That web still resists our old habits of control. Relations of family and\nfaith and clan link and activate murderous, relentless actors. The super power had\nall the nouns: Tanks, planes, soldiers, money. But we did not have the networks.

The islands host over 2.5 million visitors per year, most of\nwhom arrive by cruise ship, and tourism is the dominant economic engine of the islands, accounting\nfor roughly 70 percent of the total gross territorial product.\n\nEach district has its own distinct landscape, mix and intensity of land uses, cultural identity, and\nprospects for future development. St Thomas is home to the capital and the territory’s largest city,\nCharlotte Amalie, which has an estimated population of roughly 19,000 persons. St Thomas is the\nprimary center for resort tourism, government, finance, trade, and commerce, but its rugged\nlandscape limits the land available for agriculture and other types of land-intensive development.\nCharlotte Amalie is also home to a major deepwater harbor that is along major shipping routes to the\nPanama Canal, and it is just east of the Cyril E King International Airport — one of the busiest airports in\nCaribbean. St. Thomas has two cruise ship docks, and is the most frequented cruise ship port in the\nCaribbean.\n\nThe island of St John is just under 3 miles to the east of St Thomas. Cruz Bay is located on the western\ncoast of the island and serves as its primary port and link to St Thomas. Nearly two thirds of St John is\nowned by the National Park Service and is off-limits to commercial development.\n\nSt Croix is largest of the three islands, in both land area and population. It is roughly 45 miles to the\nsouth of St Thomas. Its primary towns are Christiansted and Frederiksted. Overall the island is flatter\nand has more land available for additional agricultural, commercial and residential development than\nSt Thomas. St Croix is also the primary manufacturing center for the Virgin Islands, with rum\ndistilleries, a major watch-assembly plant, and; until February 2012, one of the world’s largest\npetroleum refineries (which recently ceased refining operations).\n\nHistory\n\nThe Virgin Islands were originally settled by the Ciboney, Carib, and Arawaks. The islands were named\nby Christopher Columbus on his second voyage in 1493 for Saint Ursula and her virgin followers. Over\nthe next three hundred years, the islands were held by many European powers, including Spain,\nEngland, the Netherlands, France, and Denmark-Norway. The Danes developed the islands with\nplantation estates, and the estates boundaries are still used in legal descriptions for land to this day.\n\nThe U.S. took possession of the islands on March 31, 1917 and the territory was renamed the Virgin\nIslands of the United States. U.S. citizenship was granted to the inhabitants of the islands in 1927.\n\nGovernment\n\nThe U.S. Virgin Islands are an organized, unincorporated United States territory. Even though they are\nU.S. citizens, Virgin Islands residents cannot vote in presidential elections. Virgin Islands residents,\nhowever, are able to vote in presidential primary elections for delegates to the Democratic National\nConvention and the Republican National Convention.\n\nThe main political parties in the U.S. Virgin Islands are the Democratic Party of the Virgin Islands, the\nIndependent Citizens Movement, and the Republican Party of the Virgin Islands.

As with the dangers of\ndehumanization and its role in denying reality, so too is self-deception a dangerous state of mind,\nallowing individuals to inflict great harm while feeling aligned with the angels.\n\nWhat did William Safire have in mind when he called Hilary Clinton a congenital liar?\nCongenital refers to a trait that is present in utero, at birth or soon thereafter. Congenital disorders,\ndiseases, or anomalies typically refer to defects caused by a combination of genetic and environmental\nproblems. A cleft lip is an example of a congenital anomaly, one that appears at birth as a gap in the\nupper lip. Because we don’t have detailed records of Hilary Clinton’s life as a child, it is hard to say\nwhether her lying was congenital in the same way that a hair lip is congenital. We can rule out the in\nutero and at birth periods because Hilary, like all other children, was not born speaking or lying. These\ncapacities mature. That she developed a tendency to exaggerate and distort is consistent with other\nreports. She falsely claimed that she was centrally involved in the creation of a Children’s Health\nInsurance Program, an initiative that was actually created by Senators Ted Kennedy and Orin Hatch. She\nalso claimed that she played a significant role in the Good Friday Agreement for Northern Ireland, a\ncomment that Nobel laureate Lord William David Trimble described as “a wee bit silly.” When Safire\ndescribed Clinton as a congenital liar, what he was referring to was the habitual pattern of fabrication.\nWhen patterns of the mind become habits, they are hard to break. Each distortion, rehearsed over and\nover, becomes part of the fabric of truth. It is a life story that starts as fiction and ends up as non-fiction in\nthe mind of the story-teller. We can begin to understand this transformation by looking at the clinician’s\nnotebook.\n\nFor more than 100 years, psychiatrists have described a syndrome known as pathological lying.\nIf lying is pathological, it must deviate from some norm. The psychiatrist Charles Dike sums up the\nessence of this disorder:\n\nPathological liars can believe their lies to the extent that, at least to\nothers, the belief may appear to be delusional; they generally have sound\njudgment in other matters; it is questionable whether pathological lying\nis always a conscious act and whether pathological lars always have\ncontrol over their lies; an external reason for lying (such as financial\ngain) often appears absent and the internal or psychological purpose for\nlying is often unclear; the lies in pathological lying are often unplanned\nand rather impulsive; the pathological liar may become a prisoner of his\nor her lies; the desired personality of the pathological liar may\noverwhelm the actual one; pathological lying may sometimes be\nassociated with criminal behavior; the pathological lar may\nacknowledge, at least in part, the falseness of the tales when\nenergetically challenged; and, in pathological lying, telling lies may\noften seem to be an end in itself.\n\nHauser Chapter 3.

I’m a Vatican correspondent for Zenit\nnews agency, for their English edition. I have some experience working in New York — I\nwas working for PricewaterhouseCoopers auditing investment banks, one of which was\nGoldman Sachs. And considering this conference is on poverty, I’m curious — from your\npoint of view especially, your experience in the investment banking world — what\nconcrete measures do you think they should be doing to combat, prevent this\nphenomenon? We know that various sums of money are used in all sorts of ways and they\ndo have different initiatives, but in order to concretely counter this epidemic now, what\n\nare your thoughts?\n\n“For Christians, and particularly for those who believe in the underpinnings of the\nJudeo-Christian West, I don’t believe that we should have a [financial] bailout.”\n\nBannon: That’s a great question. The 2008 crisis, I think the financial crisis — which, by\nthe way, I don’t think we’ve come through — is really driven I believe by the greed, much\nof it driven by the greed of the investment banks. My old firm, Goldman Sachs —\ntraditionally the best banks are leveraged 8:1. When we had the financial crisis in 2008,\nthe investment banks were leveraged 35:1. Those rules had specifically been changed by a\nguy named Hank Paulson. He was secretary of Treasury. As chairman of Goldman Sachs,\nhe had gone to Washington years before and asked for those changes. That made the\nbanks not really investment banks, but made them hedge funds — and highly susceptible\nto changes in liquidity. And so the crisis of 2008 was, quite frankly, really never recovered\nfrom in the United States. It’s one of the reasons last quarter you saw 2.9% negative\ngrowth in a quarter. So the United States economy is in very, very tough shape.\n\nAnd one of the reasons is that we’ve never really gone and dug down and sorted through\nthe problems of 2008. Particularly the fact — think about it — not one criminal charge has\never been brought to any bank executive associated with 2008 crisis. And in fact, it gets\n\nworse.

It shows how easily we can flip our values in the face of tempting alternatives.\nThe scientific evidence presented in this section shows that our decisions to treat others according\nto different moral principles or norms is powerfully affected by our sense of what counts as another\nhuman being. What counts includes at least two important dimensions, one focused on agency and the\nother on experience. These dimensions determine whether we blame or praise someone, punish or\nrehabilitate them, and ultimately, include or exclude them from the inner circles of moral agents or moral\npatients. Those who fall outside these two inner circles are morally worthless. Those who are morally\nworthless can be destroyed or banished. Some things are justifiably excluded and fit with our general\nsense of reality — rocks, dirt, cardboard boxes, plastic balls, and pieces of glass. Other things are\nexcluded because they don’t fit with our values of what reality should be. This is where distortion and\ndenial enter the process. This is where we create walls around members of one group in order to keep\nothers out. This is where we express partiality instead of the impartiality that Lady Justice champions\nwith her two balanced scales and blind fold-covered eyes. This is where we exclude others from our inner\nsanctum in order to justify great harms. How is the inner sanctum set up and put into action over a\n\nlifetime, sometimes for legitimate causes and sometimes for illegitimate and unconscionable causes?\n\nPopulating the inner sanctum\n\nElie Wiesel, the Nobel Peace Laureate and Holocaust survivor, remarked that “anti-Semitism is the most\nancient form of prejudice.” This claim may well be true of human written history, but is most definitely\nfalse if one considers the fact that all social animals and human societies, including the hunter-gatherer\ngroups that are descendants of people that predated the Jews, hate some individuals and love others.\nPrejudice, though often based on deep seated ideological biases and stereotypes that humans invent, is, at\nroot, a form of partiality. Every social animal, either extinct or alive today, expresses partiality. This is a\nhighly adaptive and ancient psychology, promoting the care of young, investment in mates, and escape\nstrategies against enemies. Humans are no different, except for the role that our promiscuous brains play\nin fueling partiality with ideology and symbolism. Sometimes when we express our partiality it is for the\nnoble cause of caring for our children and for defending ideological beliefs surrounding humanitarian\ncauses, including defense of basic human rights. Sometimes when we express our partiality, it is for the\nignoble cause of destroying others. How does human partiality begin? Do babies express preferences for\ncertain social categories? How does their experience sculpt new categories? How is the inner sanctum\n\npopulated, enabling us to preferentially help those within and harm those outside?\n\nHauser Chapter 3.

I informed\nthe Cabinet last march that the rate of Emiratization in the ministries has not reached the targeted level, as it did\nnot exceed 54 percent and 25 percent in the Federal Authorities. I gave directives to prepare a study to denote\nthe reasons for such a situation in order to draw suitable programs to fill this gap.\n\nBy Al-Sharq al-Awsat Daily\n\nAlmost a year ago, Your Highness introduced a major reshuffle in the Cabinet. You\nmentioned that any minister is liable to change. Is there a plan for a cabinet reshuffle\nsoon?\n\nThere is a fact which should not be absent from the minds of people — that is, the government 1s at the service of\nthe people. A reshuffle is introduced when there is a need for it, and when we find that it suits an active\nhandling of the need of national demands, to ensure the power of the union to achieve the objectives of its\nstrategy, and whatever objective that may come up to meet the actual developments. I still say that any minister\nor a man of responsibility entrusted with him is open to replacement by another one who is more capable of\nshouldering that responsibility. The basic reference in any decision of this type is the criteria of performance\nand level of fulfillment of plans for development projec ts.\n\nBy Al-Sharq al-Awsat Daily\n\nFrankly, people outside the Emirates think there is a kind of sensitivity among the seven\nEmirates. With reference to the federal system adopted by the state, how do you respond\nto that?\n\nI do not understand what you mean by “sensitivity” and the relation of the word to the federal system. But I\nknow the reason behind your question: it is the media reports which tried, in handling the reflections of the\ninternational financial crisis on the UAE, to place hurdles and fabricate differences between Abu Dhabi and\nDubai. These are vicious attempts that ignored the way the UAE faced the repercussions of the global financial\ncrisis and the superb performance of our federal entities, under the leadership of His Highness, the President of\nthe UAE. The performance was excellent, and it presented a new proof of the capability and power of the\nfederation to face difficult challenges. Anyhow, since you brought the subject up, it is useful to remind\neverybody that the seven Emirates chose the federal system, realizing that it is the most viable system to\nsurvive and develop. The founding fathers had wisdom, vision and a future perspective. Whoever knows the\nhistory of the area and its situation prior to the establishment of the union will realize the great achievement of\nthe union in the establishment of the UAE. Ifthe results are the test, then look at the advance and achievements\nof the UAE20after 37 years of the Union. The UAE 1s a state of institutions governed by a constitution, which\ncovers the allocation of responsibilities to local and federal authorities. Like all federal states, the Federal\ngovernment is concerned with all the sovereign affairs, whether related to defense policy, the armed forces,\nnational security, foreign policy, and financial policy, legislations related to justice, economy, labor or\nresidence of foreigners.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_024940\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

And even if the Iranians knew it was coming, they’d be\nable to do nothing to stop it.\n\n“Our problem, Mr, President,” I said, “is that we can’t be sure our friend will\nshow up. Since Iran is already very nearly in a zone of immunity against an Israeli\nattack, we can’t afford to wait until the afternoon. By then, with our capabilities,\nwe won’t even be able to give the bully a black eye.” I said I trusted what he’d just\ntold me. “I’m sure it genuinely reflects your intentions now. But there are no\nfutures contracts in statesmanship. There’s no way that you, or any leader, can\ncommit yourself to what will happen in a year or two. When the moment of\ndecision arrives, nothing will be able to free you from the responsibility to look at\nthe situation as it is then, with American interests in mind.”\n\nHe accepted the point. But he reiterated his view that “kinetic action” — US\nsecurity-speak for a military strike — would not only remove his ability to exhaust\nthe non-military alternatives. He said it wouldn’t be in Israel’s interests, either.\n“We hear that even people high up in your military, in military intelligence and the\nMossad, are against it.”\n\nThat, I couldn’t deny. “We highly respect our top people in the military, and in\nintelligence. We make a point of listening to them before taking action,” I said.\n“But here’s the difference. When they look up, they see Netanyahu, or me. When\nBibi and I look up, we see heaven. Whoever is up there, we clearly can’t go to\nthem for advice. We are responsible for Israel’s security.”\n\nThe president smiled, but brought the discussion back down to earth. When he\nagain urged us to consider the American position in any decision, I replied: “Mr\nPresident, I feel compelled to tell you frankly how I see the situation. We highly\nappreciate, and are grateful, that America supports Israel in so many ways. I\nbelieve we’re doing our best to support American interests in the Middle East as\nwell. But when it comes to issues critical for the security and future of Israel, and\nin a way for the future of the Jewish people, we can’t afford to delegate\nresponsibility even to our best friend and ally. When we face such situations, we\nhave to decide on our own, and act on our decisions. I would expect the United\nStates, and you as its president, to respect that position.” He did not seem\nespecially happy with what I’d said. But he showed no anger.

Today\nPeres is widely respected as the architect\nof the Oslo Accord of 1993, achieved\nwhile he was Foreign Minister. It was the\nfirst political move toward a settlement\nbetween Israel and the Palestinians, and\nPeres deserves huge credit for securing\nthe agreement.

Accordingly, this discussion should not be\nconsidered legal advice and the trustees and other fiduciaries of each ERISA Plan are\nencouraged to consult their own legal advisors on these matters.\n\nFiduciary Duty of Investing Plans\n\nA fiduciary considering investing assets of an Employee Plan (“plan assets”) in the Fund should\nconsult its legal adviser before making such an investment. Before authorizing an investment in\nthe Fund, any such fiduciary should, after considering the Employee Plan’s particular\ncircumstances, be satisfied that the investment of such plan assets in the Fund is appropriate\nunder the fiduciary standards of ERISA, including standards with respect to prudence,\ndiversification and compliance with the governing documents of the Employee Plan and its\nrelated trust and the prohibited transaction provisions of ERISA and the Code.\n\nPlan Assets\nERISA and the regulation issued by the DOL at 29 C.F.R. § 2510.3-101, as modified or deemed to\nbe modified by ERISA (the “Plan Assets Regulation”), define the term “plan assets” as applied\n\nto entities in which a plan invests, directly or indirectly, such as the Fund.

Noth-\ning could be further from the truth. Unless you are teaching human\nsexuality or how to get a job, or abnormal psychology, you generally\ncan expect that students have very little interest in the content you\nare about to share and a great interest in the grade you eventually are\ngoing to give them. The reason for this is simple enough. Professors\nare teaching a subject.\n\nSubject, in the university world, is a euphemism for profession.\nThe profession of English professors is something other than teaching\nEnglish—it is being a professional in some subspecialty in literature\nor some allied field. Similarly, a professor of psychology has an area of\nresearch within psychology that is his real profession. When a profes-\nsor teaches, he is teaching how things work in his profession and he\nis teaching the basics of being in that profession. The percentage of\nundergraduates in a class that actually want to enter the profession\nof the professors is very small. Most have no intention whatsoever of\nentering the profession of the professors. So, they recognize instantly\nthat what they are learning is very unlikely to be of use to them in\ntheir later lives. Some take it seriously anyway and some don’t. But for\nthe most part students really aren’t much interested in what a profes-\nsor is teaching.\n\nThey don’t listen and they don’t do what you ask them to do. Why\nnot? They may be lazy, but that isn’t the real reason. It may be true\nthat they are taking four other classes, but that also isn’t the real rea-\nson. The real reason has to do with the inherent value of work, which\nis one of the real issues in the transformation from subject-based edu-\ncation to cognitive process-based education.
