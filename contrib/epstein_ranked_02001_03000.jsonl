The presumption is offensive.\n\nMr. Epstein, a 53-year-old Manhattan money manager who has hired Harvard law\nprofessor Alan Dershowitz and defense attorney Jack Goldberger, has denied knowing\nhow old the girls were. But police interviews with five alleged victims and 17 witnesses\nunder oath, as well as phone messages, a high school transcript and other items that\npolice found from searching Mr. Epstein's trash and 7,234-square-foot waterfront home,\nprovide evidence that he knew the girls were teenagers.\n\nOne girl couldn't show up when Mr. Epstein wanted because she had soccer. Another\ntime, Mr. Epstein had to wait for his \"massage\" session because the girl he wanted was\nstill in class.\n\nWhy didn't State Attorney Barry Krischer let a jury decide whether to believe the\nteenagers - including a 16-year-old who went to Mr. Epstein's house to \"work\" in\nDecember 2004 after being asked whether she needed to make money for Christmas\ngifts?\n\nProsecutors gave greater weight to the details Mr. Dershowitz provided about the girls in\nan apparent effort to assail their character. Mr. Dershowitz pointed out to prosecutors that\nsome of the teenagers had talked on myspace.com about marijuana and alcohol use.\n\nThe 20-year-old Royal Palm Beach woman who told police she recruited girls for Mr.\nEpstein has a Web page on myspace.com that features one girl using the name \"Pimpin'\nMade EZ.\"\n\nAlthough no charges of witness tampering have been filed, the parents of at least one of\nthe teenage victims complained to police of being followed and intimidated by two men.\nPolice determined that their vehicles were registered to two private investigators. Mr.\nGoldberger denied knowing anything about it.\n\nPolice also note in their reports that the state attorney's office offered Mr. Epstein a plea\ndeal that would have placed him on probation for five years, allowing him ultimately to\nwalk away with no criminal record at all.\n\nI asked Mr. Krischer's spokesman, Mike Edmondson, why the case was referred to a\ngrand jury instead of Mr. Epstein being charged and facing a trial before a jury. And\nshouldn't the victims' credibility be a factor to determine whether a crime's been\ncommitted, not whether a jury will convict? (After all, as Mr. Goldberger told The Palm\nBeach Post of Mr. Epstein, \"He's never denied girls came to the house.\")\n\nEspecially, I asked Mr. Edmondson to explain: Why shouldn't the public look at this case\nand think there are two kinds of justice - one for the wealthy and one for the rest of us?\nMr. Edmondson said he could not comment on the case because it is active, but on the\nlatter point, he offered, for the sake of \"philosophical debate\": \"Whether wealth buys a\ndifferent standard of justice across the country ... the answer to that would, of course, be\n\nyes.\n\nBut in this case, he said, \"regardless of the battery of attorneys, the outcome would be the\n\n\"\n\nsame.

In any case there will be \nneed for some work on my side before final filing is done. \nOn the other hand, if there is a \"checks and balances\" control issue, there could be a cap to my wiring powers \n(like the 10 K we discussed), that would be absolutely fine for me if this is the intent. \nPlease do let me know. \nWe can also talk about it (in Hawai now, free after 2 PM your time) \nIn any case, this is good and happy news.

As a\n\nlayman, I don’t really know.\n\nWhat I happen to know is that the publicly traded corporate sector, meaning stocks\nparticularly but also bonds, is far more liquid than the housing sector, and that the\nrest of the business sector is far less liquid than either. Risk in general includes\nliquidity risk. This leads me to the hypothesis or hunch that the housing sector in\ngeneral should be safer than the business sector, ceteris paribus, but that the\npublicly traded corporate sector, cap-weighting debt and equity claims on it, may be\n\nsafest of all.\n\nThe idea that stocks and bonds cap-weighted are safer than houses might have been\nlaughed to scorn a few years ago.

Less, in either\nfactor, gives less margin for error.

And Israeli hypocrisy has gone\nwell beyond being comical. But in fact the whole thing is farcical, in my opinon. In the US, Iran is “the\ngreatest threat to world peace”, intoned constantly from on high, in the media, everywhere. There is also such\na thing as world opinion, as measured by such ultra-radicals as Gallup. It turns out that the greatest threat to\nworld peace is the US, by a very wide margin, no one else even close, and Iran barely mentioned. The\nAmerican population is protected from these unwanted facts by the Free Press: not reported. There is an\norganization called US intelligence. They brief Congress regularly on the international security situation, all\nquite public. On Iran, they point out that it has very limited military power, even by regional standards (a\nsmall fraction of Saudi Arabia, for example). Its strategic doctrine is defensive. If — a big If— it has plans for\nnuclear weapons, that would be part of its deterrent strategy. Now who would be opposed to Iran having a\ndeterrent strategy? Answer is clear: the rogue states that rampage violently in the region and don’t want any\nimpediment: the US and Israel, also lesser ones like UK and France. One simple way to reduce the threat of\nnuclear weapons would be to establish a nuclear-weapons free zone in the region, as has been done elsewhere\n(over US objections). That’s been advocated by the Arab states for 20 years, with very wide global support,\nincluding Iran.

Table 6.2 overviews these memory types, giving key references and indi-\ncating the corresponding cognitive processes, and also indicating which of the generic patternist\ncognitive dynamics each cognitive process corresponds to (pattern creation, association, etc.).\nFigure 6.7 illustrates the relationships between several of the key memory types in the context\nof a simple situation involving an OpenCogPrime-controlled agent in a virtual world.\n\nIn terms of patternist cognitive theory, the multiple types of memory in CogPrime should be\nconsidered as specialized ways of storing particular types of patterns, optimized for spacetime\nefficiency. The cognitive processes associated with a certain type of memory deal with creating\nand recognizing patterns of the type for which the memory is specialized. While in principle all\nthe different sorts of pattern could be handled in a unified memory and processing architecture,\nthe sort of specialization used in CogPrime is necessary in order to achieve acceptable efficient\ngeneral intelligence using currently available computational resources. And as we have argued\nin detail in Chapter 7, efficiency is not a side-issue but rather the essence of real-world AGI\n(since as Hutter has shown, if one casts efficiency aside, arbitrary levels of general intelligence\ncan be achieved via a trivially simple program).\n\nThe essence of the CogPrime design lies in the way the structures and processes associated\nwith each type of memory are designed to work together in a closely coupled way, yielding coop-\nerative intelligence going beyond what could be achieved by an architecture merely containing\nthe same structures and processes in separate “black boxes.”\n\nThe inter-cognitive-process interactions in OpenCog are designed so that\n\ne conversion between different types of memory is possible, though sometimes computation-\nally costly (e.g. an item of declarative knowledge may with some effort be interpreted\nprocedurally or episodically, etc.)\n\ne when a learning process concerned centrally with one type of memory encounters a situation\nwhere it learns very slowly, it can often resolve the issue by converting some of the relevant\nknowledge into a different type of memory: i.e. cognitive synergy\n\n6.4.1 Cognitive Synergy in PLN\n\nTo put a little meat on the bones of the \"cognitive synergy\" idea, discussed repeatedly in prior\nchapters and more extensively in latter chapters, we now elaborate a little on the role it plays\nin the interaction between procedural and declarative learning.\n\nWhile MOSES handles much of CogPrime’s procedural learning, and CogPrime’s internal\nsimulation engine handles most episodic knowledge, CogPrime’s primary tool for handling\ndeclarative knowledge is an uncertain inference framework called Probabilistic Logic Networks\n(PLN). The complexities of PLN are the topic of a lengthy technical monograph [GMIT08], and\nare summarized in Chapter 34; here we will eschew most details and focus mainly on pointing\nout how PLN seeks to achieve efficient inference control via integration with other cognitive\nprocesses.\n\nAsa logic, PLN is broadly integrative: it combines certain term logic rules with more standard\npredicate logic rules, and utilizes both fuzzy truth values and a variant of imprecise probabilities\ncalled indefinite probabilities. PLN mathematics tells how these uncertain truth values propagate\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_013027\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

Among the\nfew dozen families in Mishmar Hasharon when I was born, there was no private\nproperty. Everything was communally owned and allocated. Every penny — or\nIsraeli pound — earned from what we produced went into a communal kitty,\nfrom which each one of the 150-or-so families in Mishmar Hasharon when I\nwas a child got a small weekly allowance. By “small”, I mean tiny. For my\nparents and others, even the idea of an ice cream cone for their children was a\nmatter of keen financial planning. More often, they would save each weekly\npittance with the aim of pooling them at birthday time, where they might stretch\nto the price of a picture book, or a small toy.\n\nDecisions on any issue of importance were taken at the aseifa, the weekly\nmeeting of kibbutz members held on Saturday nights in our dining hall. The\nagenda would be tacked up on the wall the day before, and the session would\nusually focus on one issue, ranging from major items like the kibbutz’s finances\nto the question, for instance, of whether our small platoon of delivery drivers\nshould be given pocket money to buy a sandwich or a coffee on their days\noutside the kibbutz or be limited to wrapping up bits of the modest fare on offer\nat breakfast time. That debate ended in a classic compromise: a bit of money,\nbut very little, so as to avoid violating the egalitarian ethos of the kibbutz.\n\nBut perhaps the aspect of life on the kibbutz most difficult for outsiders to\nunderstand, especially nowadays, is that we children were raised collectively.\nWe lived in dormitories, organized by age-group and overseen by a caregiver:\nin Hebrew, a metapelet, usually a woman in her 20s or 30s.

When was this meal?\n\n-Do you believe that there are now more people who possess Roosevelt or Carnegie-levels of wealth, the sort that can rival\ngovernments in influence? That these people face unusual challenges when entering philanthropy due to the sheer size of\ntheir fortunes? That the rich may know the business that made them rich, but not money itself?\n\n-are you interested in what will happen to the $4.2 trillion possessed by the super-rich in 40-odd years once they have mostly\ndied?\n\n-Do you believe no superrich people want to give their entire fortunes to their children for fear of how it might affect them?\n-do you advise the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation on how to convince other billionaires to join their initiatives?\n\n-did you volunteer to invest $20 million dollars in Michael's attempt to buy New York Magazine in 2004?\n\n-do you believe the recent claims about Alan Dershowitz and Prince Andrew in relation to you are \"ludicrous\" ?\n\n-When you met Michael for lunch in the West Village, was it the first time in 10 years you'd gone to lunch at a restaurant?\n\n-Do you have a support staff of young women in their 20s and 30s? Have some of them worked for you for many years, through\ntheir own marriages and as they raise families? Have any of these employees been romantically involved with you?

You had time but you didn’t have attention,\nso the time had no practical value.\n\nThe choice-minimal lifestyle becomes an attractive tool when we consider two truths.\n\n1.

He is the author of Flesh and Machines.\n\nMathematicians and scientists are often limited in how they see the big picture, beyond\ntheir particular field, by the tools and metaphors they use in their work. Norbert Wiener\nis no exception, and I might guess that neither am I.\n\nWhen he wrote The Human Use of Human Beings, Wiener was straddling the end\nof the era of understanding machines and animals simply as physical processes and the\nbeginning of our current era of understanding machines and animals as computational\nprocesses. I suspect there will be future eras whose tools will look as distinct from the\ntools of the two eras Wiener straddled as those tools did from each other.\n\nWiener was a giant of the earlier era and built on the tools developed since the\ntime of Newton and Leibniz to describe and analyze continuous processes in the physical\nworld. In 1948 he published Cybernetics, a word he coined to describe the science of\ncommunication and control in both machines and animals. Today we would refer to the\nideas in this book as control theory, an indispensable discipline for the design and\nanalysis of physical machines, while mostly neglecting Wiener’s claims about the science\nof communication. Wiener’s innovations were largely driven by his work during the\nSecond World War on mechanisms to aim and fire anti-aircraft guns. He brought\nmathematical rigor to the design of the sorts of technology whose design processes had\nbeen largely heuristic in nature: from the Roman waterworks through Watt’s steam\nengine to the early development of automobiles.\n\nOne can imagine a different contingent version of our intellectual and\ntechnological history had Alan Turing and John von Neumann, both of whom made\nmajor contributions to the foundations of computing, not appeared on the scene. Turing\ncontributed a fundamental model of computation—now known as a Turing Machine—in\nhis paper “On Computable Numbers with an Application to the Entscheidungsproblem,”\nwritten and revised in 1936 and published in 1937. In these machines, a linear tape of\nsymbols from a finite alphabet encodes the input for a computational problem and also\nprovides the working space for the computation. A different machine was required for\neach separate computational problem; later work by others would show that in one\nparticular machine, now known as a Universal Turing Machine, an arbitrary set of\ncomputing instructions could be encoded on that same tape.\n\nIn the 1940s, von Neumann developed an abstract self-reproducing machine\ncalled a cellular automaton. In this case it occupied a finite subset of an infinite two-\ndimensional array of squares each containing a single symbol from a finite alphabet of\ntwenty-nine distinct symbols—the rest of the infinite array starts out blank. The single\nsymbols in each square change in lockstep, based on a complex but finite rule about the\ncurrent symbol in that square and its immediate neighbors. Under the complex rule that\nvon Neumann developed, most of the symbols in most of the squares stay the same and a\nfew change at each step. So when one looks at the non-blank squares, it appears that\n\n50\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_016270\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

Take a look and normally you will find them to be\nquite different. Each example in the figure is my best attempt to translate\nthe phrase “Hello Reader” into a script and the corresponding language.\n\nSymbols of the World\n\nEnglish is one of the most irritating script languages of all. It commonly\nuses etymological elements, showing the history or origin of the word\nthat has nothing to do with the sound of the word. A word like school\nhas the ‘k sound spelt ‘ch, showing its historical derivation from the\nGreek, but confusing for pronunciation. English has 53 sounds derived\nfrom only 26 letters, so there are plenty of letter combinations, many of\nwhich are irregular. Because the language favors historical convention\nover simplicity, sugar is pronounced “shu-gar” whereas sand is strictly\nphonetic. As for Leicestershire I'll leave that as a test for the American\nreaders amongst you. If you're British, try Mattapoisett, a town in\nMassachusetts named in Native American.\n\nYet English is also a ‘lovely’ language. Because of its richness there\nare often twenty different ways to say something, and a dozen words\nto choose on any topic. One of my own favorite words is ‘jump% It is\nphonetic, but also onomatopoeic and even pictographic. Jump both\nsounds like a jump and looks like a jump.\n\nTwo scripts that puzzled scholars for many years are Linear-b and\nHieroglyphics. Linear-b — found on clay tablets on the Island of Crete -\nturned out to be a coded form of ancient Greek with some slight quirks,\nsuch as dropping the letter ‘s’ from the ends of words. The ‘s is superfluous\nin most Greek words, and dropping it saved precious clay space!\n\nHieroglyphics was a real puzzle. It looks so like a pictographic\nlanguage that it fooled many people for centuries. The Rosetta Stone was\ndiscovered in 1799 and became the key to their deciphering. This stone\nhad the same edict written out in 3 languages —- Greek, Egyptian and\nDemotic. The French adventurer Jean-Francois Champollion decoded\nhieroglyphics in 1822 and although it Jooks pictographic, it was found to\nbe predominantly phonetic. Linear-a, another script found on the Island\nof Crete has yet to be decoded and remains one of the world’s great-\nunsolved mysteries.\n\nAll these different ways to code ideas into symbols present the\nchildren of the world a great learning challenge. Because written language\nis so young, in evolutionary terms, our brains have not had enough time\nto evolve to master it. Instead words co-opt parts of our brains originally\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_015779\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

We need to rethink our priorities with the help of the passionate\nbut flawed analyses of Wiener, Weizenbaum, and the other serious critics of our\ntechnophilia. A key phrase, it seems to me, is Wiener’s almost offhand observation,\nabove, that “these machines” are “helpless by themselves.” As I have been arguing\nrecently, we’re making tools, not colleagues, and the great danger is not appreciating the\ndifference, which we should strive to accentuate, marking and defending it with political\nand legal innovations.\n\nPerhaps the best way to see what is being missed 1s to note that Alan Turing\nhimself suffered an entirely understandable failure of imagination in his formulation of\nthe famous Turing Test. As everyone knows, it is an adaptation of his “imitation game,”\nin which a man, hidden from view and communicating verbally with a judge, tries to\nconvince the judge that he is in fact a woman, while a woman, also hidden and\ncommunicating with the judge, tries to convince the judge that she is the woman. Turing\nreasoned that this would be a demanding challenge for a man (or for a woman pretending\nto be a man), exploiting a wealth of knowledge about how the other sex thinks and acts,\nwhat they tend to favor or ignore. Surely (ding!)?, any man who could beat a woman at\nbeing perceived to be a woman would be an intelligent agent. What Turing did not\nforesee is the power of deep-learning AI to acquire this wealth of information in an\nexploitable form without having to understand it. Turing imagined an astute and\nimaginative (and hence conscious) agent who cunningly designed his responses based on\nhis detailed “theory” of what women are likely to do and say. Top-down intelligent\ndesign, in short. He certainly didn’t think that a man, winning the imitation game, would\nsomehow become a woman; he imagined that there would still be a man’s consciousness\nguiding the show. The hidden premise in Turing’s almost-argument was: Only a\nconscious, intelligent agent could devise and control a winning strategy in the imitation\ngame. And so it was persuasive to Turing (and others, including me, still a stalwart\ndefender of the Turing Test) to argue that a “computing machine” that could pass as\nhuman in a contest with a human might not be conscious in just the way a human being\nis, but would nevertheless have to be a conscious agent of some kind. I think this is still a\ndefensible position—the only defensible position—but you have to understand how\nresourceful and ingenious a judge would have to be to expose the shallowness of the\nfacade that a deep-learning AI (a tool, not a colleague) could present.\n\nWhat Turing didn’t foresee is the uncanny ability of superfast computers to sift\nmindlessly through Big Data, of which the Internet provides an inexhaustible supply,\nfinding probabilistic patterns in human activity that could be used to pop “authentic’-\nseeming responses into the output for almost any probe a judge would think to offer.\nWiener also underestimates this possibility, seeing the tell-tale weakness of a machine in\nnot being able to\n\ntake into account the vast range of probability that characterizes the human\nsituation. (p.181)\n\n° The surely alarm (the habit of having a bell ring in your head whenever you sce the word in an argument)\nis described and defended by me in Jntuition Pumps and Other Tools for Thinking (2013).\n\n44\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_016264\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

He did not seem overly concerned about his\nprivacy, posting pictures of himself “mooning” for the camera. He also posted provocative\nmodeling pictures of himself on the Ars Technica website. He commented on his own beefcake-\nstyle pictures “So sexxxy it hurts” and “I like my girlish figure that attracts girls.” He approached\na model agency called Model Mania. He had some concern about the photographer who “shoots\nmostly guys.” Snowden said in a post he was “a little worried he might, you know, try to pull my\npants off and choke me to death with them, but he turned out to be legit and is a pretty damn\ngood model photographer.” He posted the photographs on the Internet, commenting: “ I think I\nlook pretty good in the shots, so it's kind of hard to get used to thinking of yourself in terms of\nbeing an element in a picture as opposed to just a picture of X.\" Despite his enthusiasm, the lack\nof any paid job offers dashed any hopes he had of a modeling career.\n\nHe also began dating Lindsay Mills around this time. She was an extremely attractive 19-year\nold art student at the Maryland Institute College of Art. Jonathan Mills, Lindsay’s father, was an\napplications developer at the Oracle Corporation. According to him, she met Snowden on an\nInternet dating site. However they met, Snowden and Mills had much in common. They both had\ndivorced parents who gave them a great deal of latitude in conducting their personal lives. Both\nof them were keenly interested in perfecting their bodies through exercise and diet regimes, Mills’\nonly paid employment over the next 8 years would be as a fitness and Yoga instructor in\nMaryland. They both also had ambitions to be models and neither of them had inhibitions about\nposing provocatively for photographers. They both also had a desire to travel to exotic places,\nincluding cities in Asia. Mills had spent four month in Guilin, China before meeting Snowden.\n\nAs bleak as his prospects as a high school dropout may have seemed, he had an unexpected\nstroke of good fortune in the spring of 2006. The CIA, out-of-the-blue, offered Snowden a\n$66,000 a year job as a CIA communications officer. “I don’t have a degree of ANY type. In fact,\nI don’t even have a high school diploma,” Snowden boasted in May 2006 on the website Ars\nTechnica under his alias The TrueHooHa. He added, with only a slight exaggeration, “I make\n70K.”\n\nBut how did Snowden get the job? The CIA’s minimum requirements in 2006 for a job in its\nclandestine division included a bachelor's or master's degree and a strong academic record, with a\npreferred GPA of 3.0 or better. Snowden had only completed one year of high school. He had\nnever attended college. He said himself that he had “no degree.” So he had none of the requisite\ndegrees for the job he got.\n\nCIA deputy director Ledgett said the CIA needed technical workers in 2006. But even if\nSnowden only applied in this capacity, which entailed a 5-year contract-term employment\nagreement, the minimum requirements for an intelligence technology job were a minimum of an\nAssociates’ Degree awarded by a two-year Community college in Electronics and\nCommunications Engineering Technology Computer Network Systems, or Electronics\nEngineering Technology.

ESG adopters overwhelmingly\nobserve a positive differential in long-term returns\n\n(with 70% of respondents perceiving an increase\n\nin returns from ESG as seen in figure 26), and\n\nmany adopters explained that they were seeking to\n\nintegrate systematic ESG risk measurement into the\n\ninvestment process. However, ESG user and non-user\nrespondents acknowledge that there is a need for\nrobust data on integrated ESG strategies, which can\nonly be addressed through continued measurement\nof the impact on performance.\n\nDespite uncertainties around the impact of ESG\nintegration, there is a growing consensus among all\nrespondents on the positive effect of governance\non investment returns. However, there are many\nchallenges to developing and managing an active\nownership strategy:\n\n- Many sovereigns have not defined their governance\nprinciples and were wary of demanding levels of\ntransparency from their investees that the sovereign\nfund itself did not provide\n\n- The adoption of active ownership requires hiring\nsubject matter experts, and many investment\nsovereign respondents were intent on using\nrecruitment budget to expand internal investment\nteams\n\n- Certain sovereigns did not hold shareholder voting\nrights across the majority of their securities and\nwere wary of the costs involved in switching these\ninvestments for those with voting rights\n\n- Many respondents stated that they were challenged\nby lack of engagement from consultants and asset\nmanagers\n\nWhile smaller sovereigns have been dissuaded from\n\ninvestment engagement by these cost restraints,\n\nevidence of benefits in returns and representation\n\nof sovereign interests will be key in driving greater\n\nuptake of sovereign active ownership. With some\n\nsovereigns looking internally to invest, based on the\nability to embed government-based engagement,\nasset managers must respond by offering sovereigns\nthe opportunity participate in the stewardship of\ncompanies by means of voting rights.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_026715\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

Finally, although 18 U.S.C. §2423(f)(2) also defines “illicit\nsexual conduct” as any commercial sex act with a person under the age of 18, 18 U.S.C. §2423(g)\nalso provides a specific affirmative defense as to that age element if proven by a preponderance of\nthe evidence that Mr. Epstein reasonably believed that the young women had attained the requisite\nlegal age. As we have demonstrated, time and again the women involved lied to Mr. Epstein as to\ntheir true age, representing that they were, in fact, over the age of 18. Many of them also represented\nthat they worked at local massage parlors, which presumably would have imposed a legal age\nrequirement.\n\nLastly, in contrast to 18 U.S.C. §1591, Mr. Epstein’s conduct did not involve trafficking of\nwomen or children in the sex industry, and was not part of any phenomenon that, in the aggregate,\nhad an economic impact on interstate or foreign commerce. Additionally, Mr. Epstein did not\nbenefit financially from the alleged conduct. Therefore, as the SAO determined, and still believes,\nMr. Epstein was a customer, a “John” for whom prosecutions are best left to the State to address.\nIndeed, there is no reported precedent extending federal law to a local “John” who does not violate\nthe child exploitation statutes. Indeed, CEOS does not point to a single case where federal\nprosecutors have used § 1591 ina case involving facts like these. Instead, every § 1591 prosecution\nhas involved national or international sex trafficking and/or for-profit prostitution rings, involving\nthe knowing use of minors and/or forcible coercion, or forcible rape, physical abuse or intimidation.\nThese are the elements required by the statute, and they are not met here.\n\nAlthough CEOS could, perhaps, point to United States v. Evans, 476 F.3d 1176 (11\" Cir.\n2007) as a case that, standing alone, involved wholly intrastate conduct, the facts of that case are far\ndifferent in key respects than this one. The Evans case involved both the commercial and coercive\ncomponents that Congress, and administration policy statements intended in 18 U.S.C. § 1591\nprosecutions. Evans, and his co-conspirators (Madison and Yearby) were not “Johns.” They\noperated a for profit prostitution ring marked by control of, and extreme violence toward, the\nvictims, who they knew were underage. Indeed, Evans forced one such victim, age 14 years old, to\ncontinue to work even after she had been hospitalized with AIDS. As part of their business, Evans\nand his co-conspirators provided the victims with cell phones, hotels, and condoms, and the victims\nwere forced to give all of their money from this prostitution ring to Evans and his co-conspirators.\nNone of this type of activity comes close to the facts regarding Mr. Epstein. Finally, but significantly,\nthe prostitution ring in Evans was not, in fact, entirely intrastate as the companion case of one of the\nEvans co-defendants makes clear. See, United States v. Madison, 477 F.3d 1312, 1313-1314 (1 14\nCir. 2007) (Jane Doe #2 stated that she traveled to Atlanta, Georgia with Madison to work as a\nprostitute).\n\nThus, courts, including the Eleventh Circuit in Evans, have underscored the point that § 1591\nsimply is not intended to cover the kind of alleged conduct at issue here. “Section 1591 does not\ncriminalize all acts of prostitution (a vice traditionally governed by state regulation). Rather, its\nreach is limited to sex trafficking that involves children or is accomplished by force, fraud, or\ncoercion.” United States v. Evans, 476 F.3d at 1179 n. 1; See also United States v. Sims, 171 Fed.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_012195\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

At the heart of the case for global zero is an argument—\nthat reductions (on the way to zero) in our nuclear force will lead\nothers to reduce theirs or curtail or abandon plans to acquire them\naltogether—that ignores history, logic, and politics.\n\nOne important reason why most friends and allies of the United\nStates (Britain and France being the exceptions) have not sought\nnuclear weapons of their own has been our readiness to extend the\nprotection of our nuclear deterrent to cover them. Germany, Japan,\nand South Korea, all quite capable of building nuclear weapons, went\nthrough even the precarious periods of the Cold War confident that\nour nuclear force made it unnecessary for them to have nuclear forces\nof their own. Where the United States was unwilling or unable to\noffer protection to countries that believed themselves threatened—\nIndia and Pakistan, for example—those countries did build\nindependent nuclear capabilities. If the United States is seen to be\nheading toward eliminating its nuclear capabilities, countries that\nhave relied on us may decide that they must acquire their own nuclear\nweapons. This is especially true in a region where another state, like\nIran, is pursuing nuclear weapons and is likely to obtain them, thus\nalarming and frightening its neighbors into an arms race they would\nrather avoid. The sad history of the nuclearization of the Indian\nsubcontinent, for instance, appears to have begun with India\nresponding to China’s nuclearization, followed by Pakistan\nresponding to India’s. If the United States is seen to be on a path to\nrelinquishing nuclear weapons, is it reasonable to expect the Japanese\nand the South Koreans, long sheltered by our deterrent, to remain\nindifferent to the nuclear forces of China and North Korea?\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_023498\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

I was sure that after\nsomething like this there had to be some sign of who had done it. But they\nlooked the same as before, eating and talking as if nothing had happened.\n\nThe Yemenis also needed jobs. This led to a challenge for Mishmar\nHasharon. The core of the kibbutz ethos was that we would live from our own\nlabor. Yet Ben-Gurion insisted we and other kibbutzim provide work for the\nYemenis and other new arrivals from the Arab states. We began hiring Yemeni\nworkers when I was about ten, the age when we kids started working for an\nhour or so each day in the fields. We worked alongside several dozen Yemeni\nwomen who lived a few miles north in a maabarah, a transit settlement which\nlater evolved into a village called Elyakhin. Each morning, the Yemenis arrived\nin a bus, and they left at the end of their day’s work.\n\nI don’t know whether I expected to feel a Gordonian sense of joy at the\nredemptive value of physical labor when I began working in the fields. Our first\nassignment was to plant long rows of flower bulbs — gladioli — spaced at\nintervals of four inches or so. But as I joined the other children and the Yemeni\nwomen, what I felt was more mundane. Heat. Fatigue. Boredom. To make the\ntime pass, I thought of it as a competition. Each of us began together, planting\nthe bulbs in furrows stretching to the end of the field. The point was obviously\nto do it right. But I found it interesting to see who finished first, and how much\nlonger it took the rest of us.\n\nThe same worker always led the way. She was a Yemeni in her early thirties.\nHer name was Baddura. Short and stocky, with dark curly hair, she was nearly\nalways smiling, whether we were planting bulbs, sowing seeds or picking\noranges and grapefruit and lemons, potatoes or peppers and tomatoes. When I\nremarked to her how much better and faster she was than the rest of us, she\nlaughed. Still years away from growing into my adult body, I looked more like a\neight- or a nine-year-old. She took me under her wing. The next day, we were\npicking tomatoes. “Do the row next to mine,” she said. Watching the almost\nballetic grace with which she moved made it easier. I decided it was like\nmastering a new piece on the piano. The secret was to achieve a kind of\nunthinking fluidity, by focusing on the passage one or two ahead of the one you\nwere playing. Physically, Baddura was far stronger than me. Before long,\nhowever, I was finishing my sowing or reaping a good ten yards ahead of the\nother kids, and not too far behind her.\n\nThough the Yemenis worked in our fields, they were not members of the\nkibbutz. They were paid a day-rate. Though they were by far the most\n\n32\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_011503\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

Bannon also recognized that the Ryan rapprochement spoke to\nTrump’s new appreciation of where he found himself. It was not just that Ryan had been\nwilling to bow to Trump, but that Trump was willing to bow to his own fears about how\nlittle he actually knew about being president. If Ryan could be counted on to handle\nCongress, thought the president, well, phew, that takes care of that.\n\n7 OK Ok\n\nTrump had little or no interest in the central Republican goal of repealing Obamacare. An\noverweight seventy-year-old man with various physical phobias (for instance, he lied\nabout his height to keep from having a body mass index that would label him as obese), he\npersonally found health care and medical treatments of all kinds a distasteful subject. The\ndetails of the contested legislation were, to him, particularly boring; his attention would\nbegin wandering from the first words of a policy discussion. He would have been able to\nenumerate few of the particulars of Obamacare—other than expressing glee about the silly\nObama pledge that everyone could keep his or her doctor—and he certainly could not\nmake any kind of meaningful distinction, positive or negative, between the health care\nsystem before Obamacare and the one after.\n\nPrior to his presidency, he had likely never had a meaningful discussion in his life\nabout health insurance. “No one in the country, or on earth, has given less thought to\nhealth insurance than Donald,” said Roger Ailes. Pressed in a campaign interview about\nthe importance of Obamacare repeal and reform, Trump was, to say the least, quite unsure\nof its place on the agenda: “This is an important subject but there are a lot of important\nsubjects. Maybe it is in the top ten. Probably is. But there is heavy competition. So you\ncan’t be certain. Could be twelve. Or could be fifteen. Definitely top twenty for sure.”\n\nIt was another one of his counterintuitive connections to many voters: Obama and\nHillary Clinton seemed actually to want to talk about health care plans, whereas Trump,\nlike most everybody else, absolutely did not.\n\nAll things considered, he probably preferred the notion of more people having health\ninsurance than fewer people having it. He was even, when push came to shove, rather\nmore for Obamacare than for repealing Obamacare. As well, he had made a set of rash\nObama-like promises, going so far as to say that under a forthcoming Trumpcare plan (he\nhad to be strongly discouraged from using this kind of rebranding—political wise men\ntold him that this was one instance where he might not want to claim ownership with his\nname), no one would lose their health insurance, and that preexisting conditions would\ncontinue to be covered. In fact, he probably favored government-funded health care more\nthan any other Republican. “Why can’t Medicare simply cover everybody?” he had\nimpatiently wondered aloud during one discussion with aides, all of whom were careful\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_020006\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

Roosevelt reactivated the operation\nas the Signal Security Agency. It proved its value in breaking the\nJapanese machine-generated cipher “Purple.” In June 1942, using\ndeciphered Japanese messages to pinpoint the location of the Japa-\nnese fleet at Midway, America won a decisive naval victory in the\nPacific. Germany’s Enigma encoding machines, with three encoding\nwheels, proved more of a challenge. Initially, British cryptanalysts\nled by the brilliant mathematician Alan Turing succeeded in build-\ning a rudimentary computer to decipher Germany’s messages to its\nsubmarines and bombers, but in 1942 Germany added a fourth set of\nencoding wheels, escalating what was essentially a battle of machine\nintelligence. The U.S. Navy then contracted with the National Cash\nRegister Company to build a computing machine capable of break-\ning the improved Enigma, and in May 1943 it succeeded.\n\nBy the time the war ended in 1945, the United States had over\none hundred giant decryption machines in operation. This unrivaled\ncapability to read the communications of foreign nations, which\nremained one of America’s most closely guarded secrets, was trans-\n\n© ferred to the Army Security Agency based at Fort Meade, Mary- ©\nland. Then, on October 24, 1952, President Harry S. Truman greatly\nexpanded its purview and changed its name to the National Security\nAgency.\n\nThe NSA was given two missions. The first one was protecting\nthe communications of the U.S. government. The main risk was that\nthe Soviets would find a way of breaching U.S. government chan-\nnels of communications. The second mission was intercepting all the\nrelevant communications and signals of foreign governments. This\nlatter mandate included the governments of allies as well as enemies.\nThe president, the other intelligence services, and the Department\nof Defense deemed what was relevant for national security. Even\nthough the NSA remained part of the Department of Defense, its\njob went far beyond providing military intelligence. It also acted as\na service agency to other American intelligence services. They pre-\npared shopping lists of foreign communications intelligence targets\nfor the NSA to pursue.\n\nAs the Cold War heated up in the 1960s, the NSA provided intel-\nligence not only to the Pentagon but to the Department of State, the\n\n| | Epst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.indd 199 ® 9/30/16 8:13AM | |\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_019687\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

My journey from grossly overworked and severely underpaid office worker to member of the\nNR is at once stranger than fiction and—now that I’ve deciphered the code—simple to duplicate. There\nis a recipe.\n\nLife doesn’t have to be so damn hard. It really doesn’t. Most people, my past self included, have spent\ntoo much time convincing themselves that life has to be hard, a resignation to 9-to-5 drudgery in\nexchange for (sometimes) relaxing weekends and the occasional keep-it-short-or-get-fired vacation.\n\nThe truth, at least the truth I live and will share in this book, is quite different.

It begins with a simple distinction most people miss—one I missed for 25 years.\n\nPeople don’t want to be millionaires—they want to experience what they believe only millions can\nbuy. Ski chalets, butlers, and exotic travel often enter the picture. Perhaps rubbing cocoa butter on your\nbelly in a hammock while you listen to waves rhythmically lapping against the deck of your thatched-\nroof bungalow? Sounds nice.\n\n$1,000,000 in the bank isn’t the fantasy. The fantasy is the lifestyle of complete freedom it supposedly\nallows. The question is then, How can one achieve the millionaire lifestyle of complete freedom without\nfirst having $1,000,000?\n\nIn the last five years, I have answered this question for myself, and this book will answer it for you. I\nwill show you exactly how I have separated income from time and created my ideal lifestyle in the\nprocess, traveling the world and enjoying the best this planet has to offer. How on earth did I go from\n14-hour days and $40,000 per year to 4-hour weeks and $40,000-plus per month?\n\nIt helps to know where it all started. Strangely enough, it was in a class of soon-to-be investment\nbankers.\n\nIn 2002, I was asked by Ed Zschau, tibermentor and my former professor of High-tech\nEntrepreneurship at Princeton University, to come back and speak to the same class about my business\nadventures in the real world. I was stuck. There were already decamillionaires speaking to the same\nclass, and even though I had built a highly profitable sports supplement company, I marched to a\ndistinctly different drummer.\n\nOver the ensuing days, however, I realized that everyone seemed to be discussing how to build large\nand successful companies, sell out, and live the good life. Fair enough. The question no one really\nseemed to be asking or answering was, Why do it all in the first place?

In it, the\ncyber-defense units of the army, navy, marines, and air force cyber\nforces were merged together and put under the command of the\nNSA director. General Keith Alexander became the first director\nof this new command. One problem for the Cyber Command was\nseparating attacks by civilians, including criminals, hacktivists, and\nanarchists, from cyber warfare sponsored and supported by adver-\nsary states. Because foreign intelligence services often closely imi-\ntated the tools of civilian hackers, and were even known to provide\nthem with hacking tools, it was not easy for the Cyber Command\nto unambiguously determine if the ultimate perpetrator of a cyber\nattack was state sponsored. For example, the identification of North\nKorea as the principal actor behind the attack on Sony in December\n2014 appeared to be a rare success, but many cyber-security experts\nbelieved that it might be a false trail used to hide the real attacker.\nClues could be fabricated in cyberspace to point to the wrong party.\n\nThe job of the Cyber Command was to prevent such an attack. To\n\nthis end, it planted viruses on hundreds of thousands of computers\n\n© in private hands to act as sentinels to spot other suspicious viruses ®\nthat could mount such an attack. Private computers had become\na new battleground in the cyber wars. It also built a capability to\nretaliate. Still, cyber attacks, which were launched through layers of\nother countries’ computers, could not be unambiguously traced back\nto the true perpetrator.\n\nThis escalation by the Cyber Command set the stage for expanded\nforms of warfare in cyberspace. “The Chinese are viewed as the\nsource of a great many attacks on western infrastructure and just\nrecently, the U.S. electrical grid,” General Alexander said in explain-\ning the need for this consolidation. “If that is determined to be an\norganized attack, I would want to go and take down the source of\nthose attacks.” The same retaliation would presumably be used\nagainst Russia, Iran, or any other adversary. Dominance of cyber-\nspace itself now became part of the NSA’s mandate.\n\nEven so, the most important job of the NSA remained intercept-\ning secret information from Russia, China, Iran, and North Korea.\nTo this end, it had an annual budget of $12.3 billion and some thirty-\nfive thousand military and civilian employees.

A few\nmonths into the school year, he told the leaders of Mishmar Hasharon, and then\nmy parents, that I would have to leave. My father was especially upset. A\ncouple of years earlier, he’d had visions of my staying on in the regional high\nschool and going to university. Now, I’d been unable to hold my own in Rupin.\nStill, both he and my mother were relieved when Mishmar Hasharon and the\nschool worked out a compromise which did not end my studies altogether. The\nexpulsion stood, but I was allowed to continue attending math and science\nclasses.\n\nFor my mother, the blow was softened by the fact I began working almost\nfull-time on the kibbutz, alongside Yigal, driving a tractor. I woke up early and\naccompanied him into the fields of wheat, barley or rye. We also made a series\nof trips 130 miles south into the Negev to a moshav called Patish. It had been\nset up by newly arrived Moroccan Jews. Since they didn’t have the equipment\nor know-how to cultivate all their fields, they were renting out some of the land.\nMishmar Hasharon had contracted to farm a parcel of 450 acres.\n\nFor ten days at a time, Yigal and I would place a tractor on the back of a\npickup and head to Patish. We worked from four in the morning until sundown.\nAfter work, we ate at a tiny family-run restaurant a few miles away in Ofakim, a\nso-called “development town” populated by Moroccan Jews who had been\nmoved there as soon as they arrived in Israel. Far from regretting not being in\nschool, I drew satisfaction, and pride, from knowing that I was functioning as an\nindependent adult. But it also gave me time to think. My whole life had been\ncircumscribed by the struggle to create and secure the state. But I again found\nmyself pondering issues of basic fairness in our young country, and the\nchallenge of reconciling our words and principles with our deeds amid the\ndifficult realities of building the state.\n\nBack on the kibbutz, it was the example of the kindly and hard-working\nBaddura which had caused me to question how we were treating the Jews who\nhad arrived from Yemen. In the Negev, I met members of the even larger post-\nwar influx from Morocco. One image struck me above all. It was from the place\nYigal and I ate dinner. Ofakim was a development town that had yet to develop.\nIt had no visible means of support, and there was no sign the government was\ndoing much to remedy that or integrate the new immigrants economically and\nsocially. The “restaurant” was a side business a family had set up in the dining\nroom of their tiny home.

They were going to find that it was much bigger than the professionals angled like\nRaymond [inaudible] that | mentioned.\n\nThey said Russia is less of a threat now than it used to be. Well, that was terrible news for the\nindustrial complex so the Team B came in and said oh, no, no, no, it's much more of a threat than it\nused to be, and that’s why we got this huge military build-up. It started actually under Carter but we\nthink of it as the Reagan build-up, and that of course is a major factor in having ended the Soviet\nUnion because the Soviet Union tried to match it with a weaker economy. And that arms race which\nwas not about threats but was about fighting economic war, that was an arms race which you could\nsay that the Soviet Union lost because they couldn't keep it up. Their economy went more and more\ndownhill because they were deflecting resources away from vital domestic functions. But really I'm\ntrying to talk here about the Halloween Massacre...\n\nJust the change in the CIA was a major historical event but it wasn't very visible. The second thing\nthat happened was they fired Jim Schlesinger as Secretary of Defense... It was being done by\n[President Ford's] Chief of Staff and his assistant who are two names barely known then but quite\nfamous since. Chief of staff was Donald Rumsfeld and the assistant was Dick Cheney. And that was\nthe first real intrusion of the Rumsfeld-Cheney team into American politics. And they became the real\nheart of what | consider the Deep State in the 1980s when they were planning for Continuity of\nGovernment which was a plan for emergency rules like warrantless surveillance and warrantless\ndetention and the militarization of homeland security. All those things were planned all through the\n‘80s - COG planning by Donald Rumsfeld and Dick Cheney. Even when Rumsfeld wasn't in the\ngovernment, he was authorized by Reagan to do this planning.\n\nAnd why is that important to our history? Because in 2001, these two men were now in the\ngovernment - Vice President and Secretary of Defense - the two top people in Washington on\nSeptember the 11th, 2001 when Bush was down in Florida - George W. Bush - and what did they do\non that day? They implemented the plans they had been planning for 20 years. Another major event\nin American history but it's not usually told that way.\n\nWe implemented - it’s in the 9/11 Commission Report that COG plans were implemented on that\nday. This is a huge change in our country. We now have an ARMY command, NORTHCOM, to take\ncharge of America - North America, the way SOUTHCOM is in charge of South America and\nCENTCOM is in charge of Central Asia.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_017591\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

Russia hesitated to join the World Trade\nOrganization and has not yet accepted that ungrudging participation in the\ncurrent rules-based order can facilitate its own progress. The more Beijing\nand New Delhi prosper, however, the more persuasive will be the case for\nMoscow to follow their lead.\n\nAs it works closely with the major developing powers, the West should also\nstep up its efforts to construct a robust rules-based world in general. In\n2003, former U.S. President Bill Clinton said that Americans should try \"to\ncreate a world with rules and partnerships and habits of behavior that we\nwould like to live in when we're no longer the military, political, economic\nsuperpower in the world.\" If Clinton's fellow citizens could accept such\nadvice, the citizens of most other countries would be willing to do the same.\nAnd this might be easier to achieve than many believe.\n\nMuch of today's global multilateral architecture was a valuable gift from the\nWest to the world. Yet the major Western powers have also made sure that\nthese institutions have never grown strong enough or independent enough\nto make real trouble for their creators. UN secretary-generals have been\ncreatures of the permanent members of the Security Council, the leaders of\nthe World Bank and the International Monetary Fund have been drawn\nexclusively from the United States and Europe, and dominance in these\nfinancial institutions has occasionally been exploited to achieve extra-\nfinancial goals. These policies should be reconsidered, for the legitimacy of\nthe system depends on the perception that its rules are developed by and\napplied fairly and equally to all, rather than that they cater to the narrow\ninterests of a few. Picking strong leaders for the major international\ninstitutions and keeping those institutions’ operations from being\nundermined or politicized would be a major step forward.\n\nWestern policymakers, finally, should work to highlight the good things that\nare happening around the world rather than harp on the bad things.\nHundreds of millions of people have emerged from poverty in recent\ndecades even as military conflicts have decreased.

[jeeyacation@gmail.com] \nThanks for sending. A wide area of agreement, but not total. \nOn confronting dogma, I of course agree — though in my opinion the secular religions — nationalist fanaticism, etc. — are \nmuch more dangerous. And if some find rational discussion offensive — as, for example, mainstream academics find \ndismantling myths of \"American exceptionalism\" or \"Israeli self-defense\" or Obama's mass murder campaign, etc., \noffensive — so be it. \nBut I don't see why that should extend to ridicule. That includes astrologists. Astronomers can refute astrology, while \nrecognizing that perfectly honest and deluded people may believe it and should be treated with respect, while their \nbeliefs are confronted with evidence. I also don't see why we should ridicule religious dogma, just as I don't think we \nshould ridicule the much more pernicious secular dogmas. Rather, we should respond to irrational belief with argument \nand evidence, while recognizing that their advocates (like most of the intellectual world in the case of secular dogma) \nare people who we should be responding to but without ridiculing them. It may be hard sometimes. For example, when \nthe icon and founding father of sober non-sentimental Realism in International Affairs informs us that the US, unlike \nother countries, has a \"transcendental purpose,\" and the fact that it constantly acts in contradiction to its purpose \ndoesn't matter because the facts are just \"abuse of history\" while real history is \"the evidence of history as our minds \nreflect it,\" then it's hard to avoid ridicule. But we should. There's no point ridiculing virtually the entire IR profession \nand the major journals, even though such extraordinary irrationality leads to major human disasters. \nOn Davis, I frankly think that's a non-issue. If she decides she cannot do her job as the conditions of employment \nrequire (including following the law), then she can quit and look for another job.

A set may be thought\nof as a hypergraph edge that points to all its members.\n\nIn this manner we may define a set of edges and vertices modeling the habitual activity\npatterns of a system when in different situations. This is called the derived hypergraph of the\nsystem. Note that this hypergraph can in principle be constructed no matter what happens\ninside the system: whether it’s a human brain, a formal neural network, Cyc, OCP, a quantum\ncomputer, etc. Of course, constructing the hypergraph in practice is quite a different story: for\ninstance, we currently have no accurate way of measuring the habitual activity patterns inside\nthe human brain. {MRI and PET and other neuroimaging technologies give only a crude view,\nthough they are continually improving.\n\nPattern theory enters more deeply here when one thoroughly fleshes out the Inheritance\nconcept. Philosophers of logic have extensively debated the relationship between extensional\ninheritance (inheritance between sets based on their members) and intensional inheritance (in-\nheritance between entity-types based on their properties). A variety of formal mechanisms have\nbeen proposed to capture this conceptual distinction; see (Wang, 2006, 1995 TODO make ref)\nfor a review along with a novel approach utilizing uncertain term logic. Pattern theory provides\na novel approach to defining intension: one may associate with each Concept Vertex in a system’s\nderived hypergraph the set of patterns associated with the structural pattern underlying that\nConcept Vertex. Then, one can define the strength of the IntensionalInheritanceEdge between\ntwo ConceptVertices A and B as the percentage of A’s pattern-set that is also contained in B’s\npattern-set.

Flynn (Ret.), produce\nany documents he may have that are responsive to a broad range of requests covering an 18-\nmonth period of time. Specifically, the subpoena requests that he create a list of all meetings and\nall communications between himself and Russian officials, and that he produce records of all\ncommunications between himself and President Trump’s campaign that were in any way related\nto Russia, for the period from June 16, 2015, to January 20, 2017.\n\nIn our May 8, 2017, letter to the Committee, we reiterated General Flynn’s eagerness to\ngive a full account of the facts and to answer the Committee’s questions, should the\ncircumstances permit, including assurances against unfair prosecution. We stated that, absent\nsuch assurances, General Flynn would respectfully decline your request for an interview and for\nthe production of documents.\n\nOur client’s position remains unchanged. Producing documents that fall within the\nsubpoena’s broad scope would be a testimonial act, insofar as it would confirm or deny the\nexistence of such documents. Under the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution and\napplicable court precedents, no person is required to offer testimony when he has “reasonable\ncause to apprehend danger from a direct answer,” even when that person is entirely innocent\nand has committed no crime.’ Indeed, the United States Supreme Court has “emphasized that\none of the Fifth Amendment’s basic functions ... is to protect innocent men ... who otherwise\nmight be ensnared by ambiguous circumstances.”? The Court held that even “truthful responses\nof an innocent witness” may provide the Government with evidence that could be used against\n\n1 See Ohio v.

This removes the implicit ‘cover’ that senior bonds holders have enjoyed and has increased speculation\nthat implementation of the bail-in proposals under the EU’s Resolution & Recovery Directive (RRD) will be brought forward to 2015\nfrom the current 2018 time-frame.\n\ne As such, our colleagues in European Credit have examined the implications of changing recovery rate expectations across the bank\ncapital structure. Assuming that covered bonds remain outside the scope of the proposals, we expect senior bank bond spreads to\nwiden relative to covered bonds and prefer being OW covered bonds vs senior bonds in the periphery, particularly in Spain where\ncovered bonds have first claim over the entire mortgage book of the bank. From a relative value point of view, we also suggest owning\nsubordinated bank bonds vs senior bank bonds in the core as, under the new RRD regime, there is a higher probability than before\nthat senior bank bond holders will lose money and this risk is, in our mind, not yet in the price (Rethinking the capital structure, R.\nHenriques et al., Mar 27).\n\nForeign Exchange\n\ne Today’s research note, Sacrificing Cyprus, examines several presumptions which have arisen over the past two weeks due to the\nCyprus crisis, and scores them on a scale of truths, half-truths and falsehoods. There are indeed some right conclusions to draw from\nthis experience, but also some wrong ones. As examples, it is true that capital controls have created a two-tier euro, but very unlikely\nthat Cyprus is exiting EMU. And while it is true that markets deserve a risk premium for policy uncertainty, the size of the premium\nshould be much lower than in previous crises due to backstops like the OMT.\n\ne For example, during the first Greek crisis in May 2010 EUR undershot by 10% relative to cyclical conditions at that time, and\nduring Greek elections in May 2012 the currency undershot by 5%. The combination of Italian and Cypriot events have eliminated the\neuro’s overvaluation from early 2013, when the currency spiked to the high $1.30s on a presumption that LTRO funds would be\nrepaid rapidly, driving European rates higher. The currency is now close to fair value, so carries no risk premium for contagion. The\nmessage is similar in vol markets: the 1% premium for 3-mo implied versus realized vol is far less than the 5% premium witnessed\nduring previous crises.\n\ne While there is no evidence that the EUR/USD cash or options market carries a risk premium, it is also true that the required\npremium should probably be far less than in previous crises given that a sovereign funding backstop like the OMT is in place. We are\nthus reluctant to extrapolate this mini-crisis into a systemic event which triggers broad deleveraging, or to forecast trend euro\nweakness. The currency could trade down a couple of cents around an ECB rate cut, but assuming that fears around Cyprus contagion\npass in a month or two, the currency should reverse its recent decline by the summertime.\n\nCommodities\n\ne Commodities rallied this week, up almost 2%, led by energy. We went tactically long Brent in last week’s J.P. Morgan View as\nwe believed that the correction in oil markets had brought prices too far below our price forecast of $112/bbl. Since then Brent is up\naround 1.5%. We stay long and expect further price appreciation over coming months. We are also short gasoline vs. Brent. Gasoline\ncracks (the premium for gasoline over crude prices) spiked over the first three months of the year due to a combination of low\ninventories and refinery closures that came during refinery maintenance season. As refinery maintenance comes to a close and demand\nfalls seasonally, gasoline prices should fall relative to Brent.\n\ne We went long Soybean time spreads late last year (GMOS, Dec 5) on a view that much higher Brazilian supplies would find it\ndifficult to leave the country due to logistical constraints. Since then we have seen a record number of ships planning to load soybeans\nin Brazilian ports and this number is still rising. The average waiting time before loading is also rising, now 38 days compared to 26\ndays a month ago. This has caused the front Soybean contract to rally while longer maturity contracts have been depressed by the\nmuch higher than normal supply inside the country. The spread between the May-13 and Jul-13 contracts has doubled since we put the\ntrade on in December. We stay long as we think these logistical issues are unlikely to be resolved anytime soon.\n\nJan Loeys\n(1-212) 834-5874\n\njan.loeys@jpmorgan.com\nJPMorgan Chase Bank NA\n\nJohn Normand\n(44-20) 7134-1816\njohn.normand@jpmorgan.com\n\nJ.P.

The Supreme Court deci-\nsion will presumably trigger tie-breaker\nrules and divorce settlement agreements\npreviously available only to opposite-sex\nmarried couples.\n\nEducation Benefits. Access to a number of\neducation tax credits by same-sex couples\nhas been limited, both because of a student’s\nstatus as a member or non-member of the\ntaxpayer's family and because lower phase-\nout levels that apply to unmarried filers.\n\na AOTC and Lifetime Learning Credit:\nA taxpayer can claim the American Op-\nportunity Tax Credit (AOTC) or the\nLifetime Learning Credit for qualified\nexpenses paid by the taxpayer for the\neducation of the taxpayer, the taxpayer's\nspouse, or the taxpayer’s claimed depen-\ndent for the tax year for which the credit\nis claimed. Because of DOMA, a taxpay-\ner could not claim the AOTC or Lifetime\nLearning Credit for qualified expenses\npaid by his or her same-sex spouse.\n\nu Coverdell Education Savings Ac-\n\nA Coverdell Education Sav-\n\nings Account (ESA) is a savings vehicle\n\ncounts.\n\nsimilar to an individual retirement\naccount (IRA). If a Coverdell ESA\nis transferred to a surviving spouse as\nthe result of the beneficiary’ death,\nthe Coverdell ESA retains its status\nand the spouse may treat the account\nas his or her own and need not with-\ndraw the assets as a result of the trans-\nfer. Because of DOMA, this treatment\nhad been unavailable to the surviving\nspouse of a same-sex married couple.\n\na IRA Withdrawals For Education.\nTaxpayers who own IRAs (tradi-\ntional, Roth, SEP IRAs and SIMPLE\nIRAs) can make penalty-free with-\ndrawals to pay higher education ex-\npenses to the extent the distribution\ndoes not exceed the qualified higher\neducation expenses of the taxpayer,\nthe taxpayer's spouse, or the child or\ngrandchild of the taxpayer or the tax-\npayer's spouse. Once again, because\nof DOMA, this treatment had been\nunavailable to the surviving spouse of\na same-sex married couple.\n\nCCH Tax Briefing\n\nPost-Death IRA Payments. When a surviv-\ning spouse is the beneficiary of an individual\nretirement account (IRA) he or she has cer-\ntain options not granted to other beneficia-\nries, including the ability to rollover the de-\ncedent’s IRA, tax free, to another retirement\nplan. And, if the surviving spouse is the sole\nbeneficiary, he or she can elect to treat the\nIRA as if it were his or her own. These op-\ntions may allow the survivor to delay the\nstart of required minimum distributions\n(RMDs) from the account and to stretch\nout the payment of RMDs over a longer pe-\ntiod of time. DOMA had foreclosed these\nmore favorable spousal benefits for same-sex\nmarried spouses. The Supreme Court’s deci-\nsion in Windsor presumably opens up these\ndistribution benefits to same-sex spouses.\n\n“In the case of family\nattribution rules, it is\nunclear whether application\n\nof marital status for same-\nsex spouses relates back\nto transactions already\ncompleted.”\n\nFamily Stock Attribution Rules. Code Sec.\n267 contains attribution rules designed to\nprevent related taxpayers (including “spous-\nes’ under Sec. 267(c)(4)) from recognizing\nlosses and other tax benefits otherwise al-\nlowed in a variety of transactions. For ex-\nample, an individual is treated under Code\nSec. 318(a)(1) as constructively owning stock\nowned directly or indirectly by his or her\nspouse (unless legally separated), children,\ngrandchildren, or parents. Stock attribution\nrules under Code Sec. 318 apply when de-\ntermining whether a redemption of stock is\ntreated as a sale or exchange or as a dividend.\nLikewise, prohibited transactions involving\npension plans under Code Sec. 4975 are\ndefined, in part, upon dealing with certain\npersons, including spouses of those persons.\n\nIMPACT. The Supreme Court's grant of\nFederal marital status to same-sex married\n\npersons is apparently not only prospective\nstarting June 26, 2013, the date of the\nWindsor decision, but also presumably\napplies retroactively to all open years.\nNevertheless, in the case of attribution\nrules, application of marital status for\nsame-sex spouses may not necessarily re-\nlate back to transactions already com-\npleted. The need under the tax laws to\nhave finality for transactions as they oc-\ncur appears to be the overriding argument\nin favor of not giving retroactive effect to\nfamily attribution.

We did some more light-hearted catching up and\nwent out to the poolside for some lunch and a swim, concluding the\nevening with an erotic massage upstairs. He paid me the usual two\nhundred dollars and asked me to come back tomorrow. “In the meantime\nI don’t want you thinking about your sticky situation, consider it dealt\nwith”. His attempt to brighten my spirits had worked relieved about\nmoney and the police but now I owed myself to him feeling indebted to\nhim more now than ever.\n\nChapter 14\n\nAs was promised I never heard back from the Police Department and\nJeffrey had his favorite girl back by his side. We picked up where we left\noff ever better than before, I being entirely subservient to every sexual\ndesire of his engaging myself in any role he wanted me to play. As he\nwas getting older his appetite for sex never hazed, if anything it only\nincreased. The orgies with other girls got larger in numbers and his\nappeal to younger girls, new toys and wilder nights expanded from once\nand awhile to quite an often occurrence in Jeffrey’s company. I put it\ndown his new friend and business investment, Jean-Luc Brunel.\n\nA long time agent for young and upcoming models, Brunel, a French\ncitizen, was known for roaming the world in search of young, naive\nbeauties living in poverty stricken countries and willing to do just about\nanything for money. He would procure them mostly from Clubs in South\nAmerica and the Former Soviet Republic. Filling their heads with\nfairytales of America and large amounts of money, he would promise\nthem all of the finer things in life, sometimes even throwing a pill in their\ndrink, if that meant getting them in his bed was becoming too much of a\ntask. What he wanted is what he got, which is why him and Jeffrey\n\n87\n\nultimately became close pals and he invested one million dollars into\nBrunel’s company. In return Jeffrey now had supply of girls on tap for\nhim to choose from.\n\nWith the assistance of each other, Brunel obtaining the illegitimate\nvisas for underage-overseas girls and Jeffrey housing them at his\nbrother’s apartment complex on 301 E 66\" St, Manhattan, they were\nquite the team. Jeffrey and Brunel would charge them for rent, forcing\nthem to work for them selling their bodies for money, nude pictures, and\neven pornography. These were what seemed like really nice people with\nnot so nice intentions setting an impression of how the dignified wealth\nplay and behind closed doors they had as much civilized manners as a\nbarbaric chimpanzee in heat. Giving a girl a step-up in finances by\nteaching them there only worth is what lay between their legs, us girls all\nwere the same in the end, regardless of what country we came from, what\nlanguage we spoke or our cultural indifferences, we all were being used\nfor one thing alone, our youthful looks and beautiful bodies.\n\nBeing Jeffrey’s permanent sidekick, I would have to part-take in a\nmany of the hedonistic exploitations that went on at one of his many\nresidences, which meant having to be uninhibited with many girls my age\nand younger. Being complete strangers was hard enough but we couldn’t\neven understand each other, speaking in different tongues we were\nexpected to excel at preforming many acts of lovemaking and foreplay on\neach other, while being observed by a man in a corner jerking off. Not\nexactly what I would call an advantage in my stage of life, but in my head\nI was convinced we all had to do what we had to do to get on with life\nand if that meant doing all of this to keep Jeffrey happy, then I would do\nthat.\n\nIt didn’t take long in the accompaniment of Brunel for Jeffrey to hit an\nall time low, at least one that [ knew about. Stupid enough or sick\nenough, | don’t know which one it is or both but Jeffrey bragged about\nhis birthday present from Brunel, once accepting three, twelve year old\ngirls, sisters at that. He replayed the descriptive events with me telling me\nhow they all massaged him and finished him off orally. He was so excited\nabout the entire event, replaying over and over again over the next course\nof weeks how cute they were and how you could tell they were really\nyoung by the small amount of hair growth in their pubic region and non-\nexistent breasts. A twelve year old, are you serious? I thought to myself.\n\nI still can’t shake the feeling of disgust when | recall the look on his face\nas he told me time and time again of how his lust brought him to that\nprofound low. He went on to tell me how Brunel bought them in Paris,\nFrance, from their parents. Offering them the usual sums of money, visas,\nand modeling career prospects was a bribe of the worst kind, they were\njust children.

For a computer\ndisplay to outperform this section of the eye it would need one billion by\n\nScintillating Dots Optical Hlusion\n\none billion pixels. The fovea centralis is tiny, only two degrees across, so\nour eyes must dart around the image to take in all the detail. Once the\nbasic information is encoded in our retina and sent down the optic nerve,\nit goes into a production line process in the visual cortex where all the\nelements are analyzed. Our brains extract information from the image\nsuch as texture, edges and depth perception in specialized portions of\nthe brain. Because of this specialization it is possible to play tricks on the\nbrain with images that are not easy to process. Some we find pleasurable,\nwhile others can be a little disturbing.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_015802\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

One research direction\nthat follows naturally from this notion is “glocal neural networks.” In order to explore the nature\nof glocal neural networks in a relatively simple and tractable setting, we have formalized and\nimplemented simple examples of “glocal Hopfield networks”: palimpsest Hopfield nets with the\naddition of neurons representing localized memories. While these specific networks are not used\nin CogPrime, they are quite similar to the ECAN networks that are used in CogPrime and\ndescribed in Chapter 23 of Part 2.\n\nEssentially, we augment the standard Hopfield net architecture by adding a set of “key\nneurons.” These are a small percentage of the neurons in the network, and are intended to be\nroughly equinumerous to the number of memories the network is supposed to store. When the\nHopfield net converges to an attractor A, then new links are created between the neurons that\nare active in A, and one of the key neurons. Which key neuron is chosen? The one that, when\nit is stimulated, gives rise to an attractor pattern maximally similar to A.\n\nThe ultimate result of this is that, in addition to the distributed memory of attractors in the\nHopfield net, one has a set of key neurons that in effect index the attractors. Each attractor\ncorresponds to a single key neuron. In the glocal memory model, the key neurons are the keys\nand the Hopfield net attractors are the maps.\n\nThis algorithm has been tested in sparse Hopfield nets, using both standard Hopfield net\nlearning rules and Storkey’s modified palimpsest learning rule [SV99], which provides greater\nmemory capacity in a continuous learning context. The use of key neurons turns out to slightly\nincrease Hopfield net memory capacity, but this isn’t the main point. The main point is that\none now has a local representation of each global memory, so that if one wants to create a\nlink between the memory and something else, it’s extremely easy to do so — one just needs\nto link to the corresponding key neuron. Or, rather, one of the corresponding key neurons:\ndepending on how many key neurons are allocated, one might end up with a number of key\nneurons corresponding to each memory, not just one.\n\nIn order to transform a palimpsest Hopfield net into a glocal Hopfield net, the following steps\nare taken:\n\n1. Add a fixed number of “key neurons” to the network (removing other random neurons to\nkeep the total number of neurons constant)\n\n2. When the network reaches an attractor, create links from the elements in the attractor to\none of the key neurons\n\n3. The key neuron chosen for the previous step is the one that most closely matches the current\nattractor (which may be determined in several ways, to be discussed below)\n\n4, To avoid the increase of the number of links in the network, when new links are created in\nStep 2, other key-neuron links are then deleted (several approaches may be taken here, but\nthe simplest is to remove the key-neuron links with the lowest-absolute-value weights)\n\nIn the simple implementation of the above steps that we implemented, and described in\n[GPI 10], Step 3 is carried out simply by comparing the weights of a key neuron’s links to the\nnodes in an attractor. A more sophisticated approach would be to select the key neuron with\nthe highest activation during the transient interval immediately prior to convergence to the\nattractor.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_013184\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

He is the author of eleven books,\nincluding The Blank Slate, The Better Angels of Our Nature, and, most recently,\nEnlightenment Now: The Case for Reason, Science, Humanism, and Progress.\n\nArtificial intelligence is an existence proof of one of the great ideas in human history:\nthat the abstract realm of knowledge, reason, and purpose does not consist of an élan vital\nor immaterial soul or miraculous powers of neural tissue. Rather, it can be linked to the\nphysical realm of animals and machines via the concepts of information, computation,\nand control. Knowledge can be explained as patterns in matter or energy that stand in\nsystematic relations with states of the world, with mathematical and logical truths, and\nwith one another. Reasoning can be explained as transformations of that knowledge by\nphysical operations that are designed to preserve those relations. Purpose can be\nexplained as the control of operations to effect changes in the world, guided by\ndiscrepancies between its current state and a goal state. Naturally evolved brains are just\nthe most familiar systems that achieve intelligence through information, computation, and\ncontrol. Humanly designed systems that achieve intelligence vindicate the notion that\ninformation processing is sufficient to explain it—the notion that the late Jerry Fodor\ndubbed the computational theory of mind.\n\nThe touchstone for this volume, Norbert Wiener’s The Human Use of Human\nBeings, celebrated this intellectual accomplishment, of which Wiener himself was a\nfoundational contributor. A potted history of the mid-20th-century revolution that gave\nthe world the computational theory of mind might credit Claude Shannon and Warren\nWeaver for explaining knowledge and communication in terms of information. It might\ncredit Alan Turing and John von Neumann for explaining intelligence and reasoning in\nterms of computation. And it ought to give Wiener credit for explaining the hitherto\nmysterious world of purposes, goals, and teleology in terms of the technical concepts of\nfeedback, control, and cybernetics (in its original sense of “governing” the operation of a\ngoal-directed system). “It is my thesis,” he announced, “that the physical functioning of\nthe living individual and the operation of some of the newer communication machines are\nprecisely parallel in their analogous attempts to control entropy through feedback”—the\nstaving off of life-sapping entropy being the ultimate goal of human beings.\n\nWiener applied the ideas of cybernetics to a third system: society. The laws,\nnorms, customs, media, forums, and institutions of a complex community could be\nconsidered channels of information propagation and feedback that allow a society to ward\noff disorder and pursue certain goals. This is a thread that runs through the book and\nwhich Wiener himself may have seen as its principal contribution. In his explanation of\nfeedback, he wrote, “This complex of behavior is ignored by the average man, and in\nparticular does not play the role that it should in our habitual analysis of society; for just\nas individual physical responses may be seen from this point of view, so may the organic\nresponses of society itself.”\n\n77\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_016880\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

Carson, US Economist and Director—Global Economic Research, joe.carson@abglobal.com\n\nPresident Trump has promised to increase defense spending—and\nthere’s support from key members of Congress. If a large multiyear\nplan is approved, it would represent a sharp reversal from what has\nbeen the weakest trend in defense spending in the past 50 years.\n\nAnd the timing and scale would have important implications for the\n\noutlook on growth and inflation.\n\nNational Defense—The Trump Plan\nPresident Trump has promised to deliver\nan ambitious program to rebuild the US\nmilitary. It would include modernizing\n\nUS nuclear weapons systems, investing\nmore in cybersecurity, enlarging the navy’s\nfleet and increasing the number of fighter\naircraft for the air force. Trump’s plan also\nincludes additional military personnel—well\nover 100,000, according to some\nestimates.\n\nThe details of Trump’s first Pentagon\nbudget will form part of the overall budget\nhe’ll submit to Congress in late February or\nearly March. The actual funding request for\nthe current fiscal year (which ends\nSeptember 30) must be completed by April\n30—that’s when the current legislation\nfunding the military budget is set to expire.\n\nMore important, Trump’s blueprint for the\nPentagon budget could set the baseline\nfor defense spending for at least the next\nfour years. It’s also worth noting that\nTrump’s military expenditures could be at\nthe low end of what some in Congress are\nproposing.\n\nFor example, Senator John McCain, who\nchairs the Senate Armed Services\nCommittee, recently released a white\npaper on defense spending, Restoring\nAmerican Power. McCain argues that the\nUS has underinvested in the military for\nseveral years, and that it is now vital for\nthe US to substantially increase funding for\nthe Pentagon. His plan calls for a $640\nbillion defense budget for fiscal year 2018,\nwhich is $58 billion above the current\nbudget baseline. Moreover, the McCain\ndefense plan urges an additional $430\nbillion in military spending over the next\nfive fiscal years.\n\nDefense Spending Patterns Are Unlike\nOther Federal Programs\n\nHistory shows that defense spending\nprograms are unusual in that they’re neither\ncyclical nor countercyclical. Most often they\nare based on military and political strate-\ngies as well as ongoing readiness to\nrespond to or engage in global encounters.\n\nBased on historical gross domestic\nproduct (GDP) data, there have been three\nlarge defense-spending programs in the\npast 50 years (Display 1).

Following this review, the committee determined to maintain the base salary of our\nCEO at its 2017 level and to increase the base salaries of the other four named executive officers to maintain the competitiveness of this compensation\nelement. All of the NEOs’ 2018 base salaries were approximately at or below the market median as determined by the compensation consultant.\n\nErnest Garcia III, our chief executive officer, had a base salary of $400,000 for both 2017 and 2018, with no increase.

That’s how the marketplace of ideas is supposed to operate in a\ndemocracy. The government must protect bad, wrong and offensive speakers from those who\nwould react violently. Speech, not violence, is protected by the First Amendment.\n\nMoreover, if a violent reaction to speech is deemed to justify the censoring of that speech, then\nthe threat to commit violence empowers “the victims” of provocative speech to serve as censors.\nThis “violence veto” should not be encouraged by the law. Hard as it may be to arrest these\n“victims” rather than the provokers, the First Amendment requires that the government side with\nthe “bad” speakers, rather than the “good” violence-threateners.\n\nIn the end, the Nazis “won” the encounter in Skokie because good and decent people in that\ncommunity decided to try to censor, rather than ridicule or respond to them.\n\nMy experience with “clear and present danger” incitement also took place in a small\ncommunity—the beautiful campus of Stanford University. Shortly after arriving at Stanford in the\nfall of 1970 for what I expected would be a year of scholarly research as a fellow of the Center\nfor Advanced Studies in the Behavioral Sciences, I was asked to represent a tenured English\nprofessor named Bruce Franklin, who was being fired for inciting students. He had spoken at an\nanti-war rally directed against the Stanford Computation Center, which was involved in war-\nrelated research. His speech including the following: “[W]hat we’re asking is for people to make\nthat little tiny gesture to show that we’re willing to inconvenience ourselves a little bit and to\nbegin to shut down the most obvious machinery of war, such as—and I think it is a good\ntarget—that Computation Center.” Following shouts of “Right on,” a group of listeners marched\non the Computation Center and physically shut it down, causing some damage. Franklin did not\njoin the demonstrators himself; he watched from a safe and discreet distance. The police\neventually cleared the building and ordered the demonstrators to disperse. At this point, Franklin\njoined the crowd and protested the order. He walked up to the police, argued with them that the\ndispersal order was illegal, and urged the crowd to remain. Many did, and the police used force\nto affect their order. Minor injuries were sustained by some demonstrators.\n\nLater that night a rally was held on the campus at which Franklin gave the closing speech. In it he\nadvocated “the methods of people’s war.” There was some dispute about whether he explained\nwhat he meant by this term. He claimed that he told the demonstrators that “people’s war meant\nthat they should go back to the dormitories, organize people into small groups, and talk with\nthem, or play football, or whatever, as late into the night as possible.” Within a few hours of\nFranklin’s speech there was more violence and this time several people were seriously hurt.\n\nThe next day President Lyman announced that Professor Franklin would be fired from his tenured\nposition on grounds of “substantial and manifest neglect of duty and a substantial impairment of\nhis appropriate functions within the University community.”\n\nFranklin demanded a formal hearing, and a faculty advisory committee of seven full professors\n\nwas convened to consider the charges and recommend an appropriate sanction. It was difficult to\nfind seven professors who did not despise Franklin—and with good cause.\n\n133\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_017220\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

Kirkpatrick and Steven Lee Myers\n\n\n\nNovember 16, 2011 -- CAIRO — Brazen attempts by Egypt’s interim military rulers to hold on to power long after elections have elicited a sharp reaction domestically and for the first time have prompted Washington to warn about the potential for new unrest. \n\nAfter months of mixing gentle pressure with broad support for the ruling military council, the Obama administration has sharpened its tone, senior administration officials say, expressing concern that the failure to move to civilian control could undermine the defining revolt of the Arab Spring. \n\nThe shift in tone is part of a difficult balancing act for Washington, which is keen to preserve its ties to the military and its interests in the region, chiefly Egypt’s role in maintaining peace with Israel. But Washington also hopes to win favor with Egypt’s newly empowered political opposition while avoiding the appearance of endorsing the militarys stalled transition to democracy. All things considered, some here have suggested, the change in tone may be intended to placate Egyptian public opinion rather than actually press the military to give up power. \n\n“I think they are working for their own interests, particularly regarding the slow transition of power,” said Shady el-Ghazaly Harb, a prominent liberal activist who was among the leaders of the Egyptian revolution. “The U.S. wants to guarantee that the coming government will be on good terms — I won’t say loyal, but friendly — and the support for SCAF is related to that.” SCAF is the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces, Egypt’s ruling military council. \n\nSecretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton underscored the shift in a speech last week that her aides later said was a deliberate warning to the military council, which assumed power after President Hosni Mubarak’s ouster. The military had initially pledged to hand over control to civilians by September, but it now says that a presidential election will not occur before 2013. And last week it laid out a blueprint for the next constitution, giving the military special political powers and protection from civilian oversight into perpetuity. \n\n“If, over time, the most powerful political force in Egypt remains a roomful of unelected officials, they will have planted the seeds for future unrest, and Egyptians will have missed a historic opportunity,” Mrs. Clinton warned. \n\n“When unelected authorities say they want to be out of the business of governing,” the United States expects them “to lay out a clear road map” and “abide by it,” she added. \n\nGiven Washington’s long support for Mr. Mubarak, and Mrs. Clinton’s comment last month approving of the military’s extended timetable for electing a civilian president, there was suspicion over Washington’s intentions. The shift occurred at the same time as a broader effort by the Obama administration to counter anti-American sentiment and reach out to opposition leaders across the political spectrum. \n\nThe United States “wants to have the cake and eat it, too,” said Nabil Fahmy, a former Egyptian ambassador to Washington, arguing that the United States wants to promote democracy without dealing with the pressure it would put on American interests in the region. \n\nThe military’s attempts to protect its power and privileges indefinitely have created an awkward situation for Washington. The United States, through the Pentagon in particular, has long nurtured close ties with the Egyptian military, which still receives $1.3 billion in American aid each year. American officials hope that whatever government emerges will continue to support American policy, including maintaining ties with Israel and distance from Iran. \n\nAt the same time, the United States’ standing in public opinion in Egypt and around the region continues to suffer because of decades of support for undemocratic governments like the military-backed system that controlled Egypt under Mr. Mubarak. Remaining aloof from the debate over the military’s future role here risks reinforcing those criticisms at a time when democratic changes are giving public opinion new weight. \n\nAs part of its broader outreach, the Obama administration has also met with the Muslim Brotherhood, the Islamist group whose political party is poised to win a major role in the country’s new Parliament and remains the biggest political counterweight to the military council. \n\nJacob Walles, a deputy assistant secretary of state, met for the first time this week with the leaders of the Brotherhood’s newly formed Freedom and Justice Party at its new headquarters in Cairo. While American diplomats have had intermittent contacts for years with Brotherhood lawmakers in the Egyptian Parliament, officials here said Mr. Walles’s meeting appeared to underscore Mrs. Clinton’s pledges to cooperate with Islamist parties that respect democracy. \n\nOthers said it might instead have been a sign that Washington simply realized that the Brotherhood was certain to play a crucial role in Egypt’s future and was likely to win a large bloc of seats in the parliamentary elections that begin this month. \n\n“They confirmed that they are keen to support the democratic process, and they will accept any results of the elections and deal with any government that respects human rights and the rights of women and minorities and the democratic process,” said Essam el-Erian, a veteran Brotherhood leader and the vice chairman of its new party, who met with Mr. Walles. “And we are keen and eager to say that we respect the democratic process and the rights of all people according to the Constitution and the law.” \n\nAdministration officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss private diplomatic exchanges, said they hoped that a combination of internal and external pressure on the council would persuade it to yield power and submit to civilian oversight. In addition to the public comments by Mrs. Clinton, other senior American officials have privately urged the council to revise its recent proposals to preserve power, the officials said. \n\nThe officials noted that since Mr. Mubarak’s ouster, the council’s leaders had repeatedly offered, then backed away from, some proposals only after street protests and public pressure, in a kind of prolonged back-and-forth that some noted reflected a true, if messy, democratic process taking root. \n\nBut administration officials and Egyptian activists note worrying signs. The military core of Mr. Mubarak’s government has “reasserted itself again,” a senior administration official said. “We don’t have great expectations that this is going to be the creation of a democratic system,” the official said, referring to the coming elections. \n\nAt best, the official added, the elections will be “a transition to a transition,” one that could leave the military as the de facto power in Egypt for years to come, as it was under Mr. Mubarak’s rule. \n\nThe military has said that it intends to hold ultimate political power even after the election of a Parliament in the coming months, and that it will play a role in drafting the constitution as well. It has refused to lift the Mubarak-era “emergency law” allowing arrests without trial, and it has sent as many as 12,000 civilians to military trials. \n\nWhile the administration’s changes in tone risk upsetting a pivotal ally where anti-American sentiment — and, in some quarters, support for the military — runs high, they are also drawing rare praise from activists here who say they appreciate Washington’s help. \n\n“I think that Secretary of State Mrs. Clinton delivered a clear-cut message to the SCAF, and I think they got that message: that the SCAF is not an elected body and must deliver the authority and turn over power,” said Emad Gad, an analyst at the government-financed Al Ahram research institute and now a leader of the Social Democratic Party. \n\nMr. Gad contended that over the long term such pressure could only benefit the American relationship with a democratic Egypt. “I think more than 50 percent of the Egyptians think the SCAF is trying to kill the Egyptian revolution,” he said. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\fArticle 2.\n\nNYT\n\nEurope’s Contagion\n\nEditorial\n\n\n\nNovember 16, 2011 -- Two years of gross mismanagement of the euro-zone debt crisis have all too predictably produced a wider crisis of market confidence that now threatens the entire 17-nation euro zone. This week’s formation of new technocrat-led governments in Greece and Italy has not calmed fears. Practically every euro zone country is paying the price in higher interest costs and ebbing economic growth. \n\nThe only country that isn’t suffering — yet — is Germany, whose competitive export-driven economy feeds on foreign demand and an exchange rate held down by its neighbors’ troubles. But all European countries cannot be Germany and run net surpluses, especially if Berlin insists on policies that keep factories shuttered and workers unemployed. \n\nAnd German leaders are wrong if they think their country will remain unscathed as its major trading partners and neighbors unravel. \n\nChancellor Angela Merkel of Germany has been talking a more pro-European line. But she is still insisting on growth-killing austerity as the price for European bailouts and still blocking the European Central Bank from printing more euros and acting as a lender of last resort. \n\nMrs. Merkel’s advisers insist that she is doing what the German people want. That is not leadership. She needs to challenge her voters simplistic stereotypes of southern European sloth and tell them the truth: The real threat to Germany isn’t inflation; it is an economic collapse across Europe. And Germany has a huge amount to lose from a fracturing of the European Union. \n\nEuropean stock and bond markets are already treating that as an ever-more-realistic possibility, shunning even moderate levels of risk and pushing interest rates to unsustainable levels. As far as they can see, Mrs. Merkel and her fellow euro-zone leaders haven’t come up with an adequate plan, sufficient political will or sufficient cash to halt the contagion. As far as we can see, they are right. \n\nThe political changes at the top of Greece and Italy are promising. Greece’s new prime minister, Lucas Papademos, and Mario Monti of Italy are internationally credible economists, committed to making painful but much needed reforms, including liberalizing labor markets, shrinking overgrown bureaucracies, shedding state properties and rooting out corruption. \n\nGiven their training, they surely understand that their economies are not now strong enough to absorb more austerity, including broad new taxes or further sweeping service cuts. Mr. Papademos and Mr. Monti should press their fellow European leaders for a new and better deal. Even with the best leadership, neither Greece nor Italy will be able, on their own, to restore their fiscal health and help slow the spreading financial contagion. That will require substantial and immediate help from their euro-zone partners, starting with Mrs. Merkel. \n\nAn all-out effort by the European Central Bank to buy bonds, lower interest rates and inject new liquidity into the markets may still calm the contagion if it begins in the next few days. The bank’s new president, Mario Draghi, may be willing to play this role, if Germany stops standing in the way. \n\nMrs. Merkel must make clear that she will support the central bank taking on this expanded role. And now that new, credible leaders are in office in Athens and Rome, she and other euro-zone leaders need to meet with them and negotiate more growth-friendly reform packages. There is very little time left to avoid financial catastrophe. \n\n\n\fArticle 3.\n\nNew York Post\n\nHigh stakes in Syria\n\nAmir Taheri\n\n\n\nNovember 16, 2011 -- As Arab foreign ministers met in Rabat, Morocco, yesterday to discuss Syria, one question was on every mind: Is the country already in a civil war?\n\nSome of the facts on the ground suggest so. With more than 350 killed so far, November has been the bloodiest month since the uprising against President Bashar al-Assad began last spring.\n\nDefections from the army, which started as a trickle, now look like a torrent. In October, the number was around 800. The best total now available is about 17,000. The defectors have organized themselves as the Free Syrian Army and are creating credible command-and-control structures.\n\nSince September, the FSA has carried out a number of symbolic attacks against the regime. And now the “shadow army,” as Syrians call it, seems to be planning more spectacular operations.\n\nOn Monday, the FSA claimed an attack on an army convoy near Deraa, the southwestern town where the revolution started. Official accounts reported at least 34 soldiers killed.\n\nYesterday, the FSA attacked the headquarters of the Air Force Intelligence Agency at Harasta near the capital Damascus. Since Hafez al-Assad, an air-force officer and Bashar’s father, seized power in a coup in 1970, the AIA has been the nerve center of the regime’s security system.\n\nAlso this week, reports surfaced of attacks by armed tribesmen on three military outposts near the Iraqi border.\n\nDespite all that, it may be premature to speak of civil war in Syria. \n\nIn a civil war, a society is divided into armed camps that, initially at least, are roughly the same size. That’s not the case in Syria, where the uprising is backed by an overwhelming majority against a government that’s dominated by a small minority — the Ba’ath Party. To make matters worse, the Ba’ath is dominated by the Nusairi (Alawite) religious minority, a mere 5 percent of the population.\n\nThus, Syria’s is a nationwide revolution against a minority regime.\n\nAlmost all Syrians agree that the situation is untenable. Assad’s policy of rule by massacre has few supporters outside his clan. Judging by the revolution’s most popular slogan — “Assad Get Out!”— a majority may support demands for Assad to stand down, as suggested by Jordan’s King Abdullah.\n\nNevertheless, the Assad clan still controls enough military and financial assets to continue its rule-by-massacre strategy. \n\nThe result could be the disintegration of the Syrian army and the emergence of armed groups beyond the control of either the government or the Syrian National Council, the opposition’s umbrella organization. That could lead to violence spilling into neighboring countries, especially Iraq and Lebanon.\n\nRather than speculating about a civil war, the Arab League and the international community should focus on the dangers that the Syrian situation poses for regional peace. \n\nA Franco-British resolution on Syria won a majority at the UN Security Council last month but was killed by Russian and Chinese vetoes. The Security Council should take up the issue again — this time to debate the threat to the region.\n\nLast month, Russia and China tried to justify their vetoes by claiming that the Arab states were divided over Syria. This wasn’t true then and is less so now. The Arab League has suspended Syria’s membership and condemned the rule-by-massacre policy. Arab support is also building up for creating havens for Syrian refugees in Turkey, Lebanon, Iraq and Jordan.\n\nMoscow had also expressed concern that, with Assad’s demise, a new Syrian government might “ignore Russia’s interests in the Middle East.” Since the vetoes, however, the Syrian National Council has established contact with Russia and China to offer assurances that a democratic Syria would pursue “cooperation with all nations.”\n\nSNC sources tell me that they’ve also “opened a dialogue” with Iran, Assad’s main supporter, amid signs that it, too, may no longer be so sure about the despot’s chances of survival.\n\nAmerica must take the lead in mobilizing international support for the Syrian revolution. By removing one of the last regimes that still sponsors terrorism, the victory of democracy in Syria is in America’s best national interests.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\fArticle 4.\n\nGuardian\n\nTurkey has a key role in Syria – now and in the future\n\nSimon Tisdall \n\n\n\n16 November 2011 -- The Arab League's unexpectedly tough action in suspending Syria, ostracising President Bashar al-Assad, and inviting opposition leaders to talks in Cairo has outraged the regime in Damascus, which suspects a US-led conspiracy to impose forcible regime change. But the increased hostility exhibited by Turkey, Syria's most powerful and best-connected neighbour, may yet prove decisive as Ankara assumes a crisis leadership role.\n\nUntil the uprising tore apart old certainties, the Turkish prime minister, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, had invested considerable capital in improved ties with Syria, with which Turkey almost went to war in the 1990s. A turning point came with the 2004 free trade agreement. This interdependence now gives Turkey significant economic leverage. Ankara has already imposed unilateral sanctions and is considering additional measures including a cut in electricity supplies.\n\nErdogan turned the screw again this week, accusing Assad personally of \"feeding on blood\" after he failed to honour the Arab League peace plan. \"No regime can survive by killing or jailing,\" he said. \"No one can build a future over the blood of the oppressed.\"\n\nTurkey's motives are not difficult to discern. Chaos on its fragile southern flank, and Syria's possible descent into civil war, would be reasons enough to prompt Ankara's intervention. But Erdogan was also incensed by weekend attacks on Turkey's embassy in Damascus and regional consulates, apparently orchestrated by the regime. The government issued a formal protest and advised Turks against travel to Syria, a reversal of its proud open-borders policy.\n\nTurkey also appears motivated by a desire to keep ahead of evolving Arab opinion. \"It can comfortably be said, in light of recent developments, that the countdown to the end of Syria's Assad regime has begun,\" said Today's Zaman columnist Bülent Kenes, reflecting official opinion.\n\nWith senior Saudi officials and King Abdullah of Jordan openly backing the revolt, and the violence escalating, Erdogan and his foreign minister, Ahmet Davutoglu, who have long harboured regional leadership ambitions, seem to be positioning themselves for a post-Assad future.\n\nIn this push towards the Syrian endgame they plainly have the enthusiastic backing of the US, for whom they are effectively acting as a local proxy in opposition to external actors such as the pro-regime Russia. Given Erdogan's sharp differences with Washington over Israel-Palestine and the Iraq war, this coincidence of view is not lacking in irony. \"We very much welcome the strong stance that Turkey has taken and believe it sends a critical message to President Assad that … he should step down,\" said Ben Rhodes, Barack Obama's deputy national security adviser.\n\nIn a series of statements, Davutoglu has insisted it is \"no longer possible to trust the Syrian government\". Adding provocation to insult, he underscored Ankara's support for the protesters and specifically for the Syrian National Council, an opposition umbrella group based in Turkey that is seeking recognition from Ankara. \"We will continue to take our place at the side of the Syrian people's rightful struggle,\" Davutoglu said.\n\nAs bilateral tensions rise, suggestions that Turkey may physically intervene in northern Syria to create a safe haven for civilians displaced by the violence are likely to resurface. Several thousand Syrian refugees are already sheltering inside Turkey, as are numerous Syrian army defectors. Possibly anticipating Syrian retaliation, the newspaper Hürriyet reported that President Abdullah Gül recently warned Assad would pay a heavy price for stirring up trouble in Turkey's Kurdish south-east.\n\nFears that a Syrian meltdown could seriously destabilise the wider neighbourhood are also driving Turkey's hardening response. Such a scenario could affect Iraq, where security concerns are rising as the US withdrawal nears completion, and even Iran, a close Assad ally.\n\nFor its part, the Syrian regime has pressing reasons to fear Ankara's animosity, as Gökhan Bacik pointed out in Today's Zaman. Unlike many Muslim countries, Turkey identifies strongly with Europe, the US and Nato. And in the past decade, Erdogan's Justice and Development party has made its brand of moderate Islamist politics acceptable to previously blinkered western eyes.\n\nIn other words, Turkey, with its majority Sunni Muslim population, furnishes a role model for the disenfranchised Sunni majority in Syria (and other Arab spring countries). Not only is Ankara encouraging revolution in Damascus, it is also living proof that Assad's politics of fear are outdated, that Syrians have before them a workable alternative paradigm, and that, after the revolution, the country's secular, Islamist and other sectarian traditions could fairly hope to co-exist peacefully, Turkish-style.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\fArticle 5.\n\nForeign Policy\n\nBarack Obama's Foreign Policy\n\nNovember 16, 2011 \n\n\nForeign-policy credentials: As president, Obama has taken on a number of major foreign-policy initiatives, including a renewed troop surge in Afghanistan, the negotiation of the New START nuclear arms reduction treaty with Russia, the NATO intervention in Libya, the withdrawal from Iraq, ongoing trade negotiations with China, and of course, the killing of al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden. \n\n\nOverview: Obama is a much different candidate today from the senator who distinguished himself by his opposition to the \"dumb war\" on his way to the presidency in 2008. Obama has turned out, in many ways, to have pursued a fairly conventional, at times, hawkish foreign policy. He has had some notable successes, such as the bin Laden raid and this year's withdrawal from Iraq -- albeit on a timetable negotiated by his predecessor -- and the successful overthrow of Muammar al-Qaddafi. All the same, \"apology tours\" and \"leading from behind\" -- referring to an unfortunate description of Obama's diplomatic strategy by a White House staffer -- have already become buzzwords for Republican candidates. He has also faced heavy criticism on the left for a sometimes inconsistent approach to international law in counterterrorism operations. \n\n\n\nBut with a significant economic recovery appearing unlikely and fewer domestic achievements to point to than he might have expected, coupled with the international inexperience of his opponents, Obama may make his foreign-policy wins the centerpiece of his reelection strategy. \n\n\n\nAdvisors: Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, Defense Secretary Leon Panetta, National Security Advisor Thomas Donilon. \n\n\n\nOn the issues: \n\n\n\nAfghanistan/Pakistan: \"We have put al Qaeda on a path to defeat,\" Obama announced last June, noting that the 33,000 \"surge\" troops he sent to Afghanistan in 2009 would be out of the country by the summer of 2012. Although a constant barrage of drone strikes and special operations raids have taken a harsh toll on al Qaeda, it may be difficult for Obama to make the case that Afghanistan has achieved stability or that Hamid Karzai's government can stand on its own without U.S. assistance. \n\n\n\nRelations with Pakistan have deteriorated significantly under Obama's tenure, particularly following the bin Laden raid. He has pledged to \"constantly evaluate\" the relationship between the two countries going forward but says he would be hesitant to cut off aid that could \"help the Pakistani people strengthen their own society and their own government.\" \n\n\n\nMilitary spending: Backed by his then current defense secretary, Robert Gates, Obama announced last April that the Pentagon will lead a \"fundamental review\" of U.S. military capabilities in order to cut $400 billion in defense spending over the next 10 years. \"We need to not only eliminate waste and improve efficiency and effectiveness, but conduct a fundamental review of America's missions, capabilities, and our role in a changing world,\" Obama said. Of course, major cuts could come sooner than that if the congressional \"supercommittee\" fails to reach an agreement on deficit reduction by Nov. 23. \n\n\n\nImmigration/borders: Obama insists that enacting comprehensive immigration reform, which would likely include a path to citizenship for at least some illegal immigrants already in the United States, is still a \"top priority,\" but with little congressional enthusiasm for such a measure, it has been pushed to the back burner for now. Meanwhile, deportations of illegal immigrants are continuing at a record pace, though the administration touts the fact that a higher percentage of those deported have criminal records. \n\n\n\nObama has substantially increased the number of agents patrolling the U.S.-Mexico border, but has also mocked the fence-building enthusiasm of Republicans, saying they won't be happy until there's a \"moat with alligators.\" \n\n\n\nIsrael/Palestine: Obama's engagement in the Israeli-Palestinian peace process has probably been the most frustrating foreign-policy initiative of his presidency and the one on which he is most often criticized by his Republican opponents. Obama continues to support negotiations on a two-state settlement of the conflict, but his best-remembered statement on the topic is controversial: his suggestion that Israel's pre-1967 war borders be taken as a starting point for negotiations, a position fiercely opposed by Israel. More recently, the administration has confirmed that it will veto Palestine's statehood bid in the U.N. Security Council. \n\n\n\nObama's relationship with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has seemed very strained at times. In a recently overheard conversation he told French President Nicolas Sarkozy, \"You're fed up with him? I have to deal with him every day.\" \n\n\n\nChina: Obama has repeatedly criticized China -- most recently at the APEC summit in Honolulu -- for currency policies that he says have a distorting effect on the global economy. The president has made a few cautious statements on China's human rights record but came under criticism for delaying a White House meeting with the Dalai Lama. This year, the administration confirmed a $5.8 billion package of arms sales for Taiwan that provoked a predictable Chinese backlash. \n\n\n\nForeign aid: In his 2010 address to the U.N. General Assembly, Obama announced an overhaul of U.S. foreign aid policies, which he vowed will place them at the center of U.S. foreign policy. In the speech he called aid a \"core pillar of American power.\" Nonetheless, foreign aid to a number of countries was cut by Congress in the 2012 budget. \n\n\n\nIran/nukes: Early in his presidency, Obama made several overtures to Iran in an effort to improve relations. Critics say this engagement strategy went too far during the 2009 Green Movement uprising against the reelection of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, when the Obama administration was reluctant to overtly back the protesters. Since then, the administration has instituted a number of new sanctions against Iran that are aimed at halting its nuclear enrichment program. \"We are not taking any options off the table. Iran with nuclear weapons would pose a threat not only to the region but also to the United States,\" Obama said in a recent news conference in Hawaii. \n\n\n\nTrade: In October, Obama signed long-delayed free trade agreements with Colombia, Panama, and South Korea. On his trip to Asia this November, Obama is working to promote a new trans-Pacific free trade agreement. \"We're not going to be able to put our folks back to work and grow our economy and expand opportunity unless the Asia-Pacific region is also successful,\" he said. Obama has indefinitely put on hold a campaign promise to renegotiate NAFTA. \n\n\n\nWar on terror/detainees: Obama signed an executive order closing the Guantánamo Bay detention center as one of his first actions as president. The facility remains open, however, largely due to congressional opposition over where to house the remaining prisoners. Obama has put a halt to the \"enhanced interrogation techniques\" employed by George W. Bush's administration but has enraged some civil liberties advocates by authorizing the extrajudicial killing of alleged al Qaeda terrorist Anwar al-Awlaki, a U.S. citizen. Obama has also disappointed some liberal supporters by resuming military trials of terrorism suspects at Guantánamo. \n\n\n\nEnvironment: Despite his stated support for environmental legislation and green energy, there has been little progress on passing major climate-change bills under Obama's watch. Thanks largely to Obama's public intervention, an agreement was reached at the 2009 Copenhagen climate summit, but in failing to impose enforceable emissions targets, the meeting was widely considered a failure. This year, Obama abandoned tough new air-quality rules, adopted early in his administration. \n\n\n\nRussia/reset: One of the centerpieces of Obama's first-term foreign policy was the effort to \"reset\" relations with Russia. The president successfully negotiated the New START nuclear reduction treaty, though there have been significant disagreements with both Russia and his GOP opponents over the contours of missile defense. Human rights advocates have criticized the president for ignoring the erosion of Russian democracy. Russia has also continued to stymie U.S. efforts to impose tough international sanctions on Iran and Syria. Obama seemed to have made friends with President Dmitry Medvedev, but relations with Russia may only get tougher, with Vladimir Putin's likely return to the Russian presidency. \n\n\n\nArab Spring: After a slow start, the Obama administration eventually came around to calling for Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak to step down, joining the NATO intervention in Libya, and supporting stricter sanctions against Syria. The president has been less outspoken about other Persian Gulf allies, including Bahrain, which hosts a key U.S. naval base. Obama has urged Egypt and Tunisia to \"set a strong example through free and fair elections, a vibrant civil society, accountable and effective democratic institutions, and responsible regional leadership.\" \n\n\n\nOther issues: Although he once described himself as a George H.W. Bush-school realist, in the past year Obama has learned to embrace humanitarian intervention, both in Libya and in central Africa, where military advisors have been sent to aid in the fight against the long-running insurgency by the Lord's Resistance Army. There's speculation that Nigeria may be next. It's a measure of how much things have changed in the last four years that Republicans are now attacking the Democratic president for trying to spread democracy and human rights at the barrel of a gun. \n\n\n\nAs the European economic crisis has worsened, Obama has been speaking out more in support of strong measures to protect the common currency. \"Ultimately what they are going to need is a firewall that sends a clear signal we stand behind the European project and we stand behind the euro,\" he said during his recent trip to Australia. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\fArticle 6.\n\nProject Syndicate\n\nAmerica in the Asian Century\n\nDominique Moisi\n\n\n\n2011-11-15 – At “ground zero” in lower Manhattan, two empty spaces will be filled by water cascades, memorializing in a serene and respectful way the victims of the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. Next to them, a powerful tower, designed by the architect Daniel Libeskind and nearly completed, rises vigorously into the sky, a symbol of the triumph of life over the forces of death. One word comes to mind to characterize the impression made by this place, the site of an unprecedented crime: resilience.\n\nIn a building that houses what will one day be a memorial museum, one can buy a DVD entitled “9/12: From Chaos to Community.” Ground Zero is the architectural and human proof that, despite America’s current economic woes, it would be premature, if not dangerous, to write the country off as a declining power. America has the moral and intellectual resources that it needs in order to rebound.\n\nBut what is necessary is not sufficient. In order to reinvent itself, if not to manage its relative international decline, America must proceed toward a rebalancing of its domestic and international priorities. In the immediate aftermath of World War I, a triumphant America withdrew from global responsibility, with tragic consequences for the balance of power in a Europe that was left to face its inner demons alone.\n\nIn the aftermath of World War II, by contrast, the US managed successfully to contain Soviet ambitions. Today, unlike in 1945, Americans do not confront an imminent threat. Russia may speak loudly (using its permanent seat on the United Nations Security Council as a megaphone), but it is a greatly reduced rump of the Soviet Union. Likewise, while the nationalism of America’s principal rival, China, has become more assertive lately, the communist regime’s clear priority – indeed, the key to its stability – is domestic economic growth.\n\nIndeed, the only obvious danger that the US faces stems from weapons of mass destruction, which could proliferate or be used by terrorist groups. But confronting this threat does not require a massive military budget or huge deployments of US troops all over the world. America has a much-needed opportunity to refocus on itself – to recover its inner strength without withdrawing from the world. As Richard Haass, the president of the Council on Foreign Relations, puts it, America must enter a period of “restoration” of its fundamentals.\n\nAmerican foreign policy starts at home, and that means reining in budget deficits over the long term, reviving economic growth and job creation in the short term, and addressing the country’s deteriorating infrastructure. Indeed, America’s “aged modernity” has become a drag on its competitiveness, as well as an insult to its international image and a risk to the safety of its citizens.\n\nMoreover, imperial fatigue has set in. Recent US history has been characterized by cycles of enthusiasm about foreign engagement. In the mid-1970’s, following the war in Vietnam, America, guided by President Jimmy Carter’s moralizing impulse, opted for “regionalization” of its engagements. But, given that the Soviet threat still existed, this effort came too early (and probably was carried out in the wrong manner).\n\nToday, by contrast, the starting point for a reassessment of American priorities is more economic than ethical. But the reasoning is the same, for it is based on the conviction that more America in the world today implies less costly and confused interventionism tomorrow. That means that US foreign policy itself – defined in recent years by too much attention to the Middle East, and too little to Asia – must embrace a shift in priorities.\n\nOf course, in the midst of today’s ongoing Arab revolutions, America cannot simply ignore the Middle East. Nor must the US give up hope on the Israel-Palestine front, or on its efforts to contain Iran’s nuclear ambitions. But it is in Asia that history is unfolding – and where the US must define its long-term global strategy.\n\nMust the US, as Henry Kissinger suggests in his latest book On China, consider the prospect of a “Pacific Community” that, unlike the Cold War-era Atlantic Community, is not based on common culture and values in the face of a direct threat, but on common interests in an “age of rebalancing of world order”?\n\nAmerica’s resilience may contrast with Europe’s multiple weaknesses. But resilience will not be enough. The US must get back into shape to face tomorrow’s challenges, and that means restoring economic growth, reducing deficits, and improving infrastructure. Paradoxically, only a more confident America can accept a reduced global status, because reconciling oneself to change is always easier once one has taken the steps needed to adjust to it. \n\n\n\nDominique Moisi is the author of The Geopolitics of Emotion. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nThe following summary is qualified in its entirety by the more detailed information appearing elsewhere in this\nMemorandum. You should carefully consider the information set forth under “Risk Factors”. The term “KUE” refers\nonly to Knowledge Universe Education L.P, a Cayman Islands exempted limited partnership. The terms “Knowledge\nUniverse Education”, the “Company”, “we”, “us” and “our” refer to KUE and, where applicable, its subsidiaries, and\ndo not refer to the Agents. In November 2005, KLC separated its education operations (“KLC OpCo”) from its real\n\nestate assets (“KLC PropCo’).\n\n1.1. Company Overview\n\nKUE is the third largest for-profit education company in the world and the largest for-profit education\ncompany in the pre-school to 12th grade segment (“pre-K-12”) in the world. While the Company's\noperations are currently based within the U.S., the proceeds from this transaction will be used primarily to\nexpand KUE’s education platform both globally and across the pre-K-12 education continuum. KUE's\nexisting portfolio of assets consists of:\n\n(i) KLC OpCo, the leading early childhood education\n(“ECE”) company with 2,507 locations in 39 states Knowledge Universe KUE Management Inc.\nand the District of Columbia and nearly two and a SCedo mae (General Partner)\nhalf times larger than its next closest competitor in 17.9% to 40.0%\"\nterms of revenue;\n\nKnowledge Learning K42 Inc.\n(ii) KLC PropCo, one of the largest education based cool on tele\n\nreal estate portfolios in the U.S. consisting of 845\nearly childhood centers located in 37 states; and\n\n(iii) A significant interest in k12, an online curriculum\nprovider and kindergarten through 12th grade management company, currently serving over\n25,000 students as the largest operator of online virtual schools in the U.S.\n\nThe principal owners of KUE are Michael Milken, Lowell Milken and Steven Green (collectively the\n“Principals”). Michael Milken and Lowell Milken each has more than two decades of experience in the\neducation sector through involvement in several for-profit and not-for-profit initiatives. Steven Green,\nformer U.S. ambassador to Singapore, has more than two decades of experience as an international\nindustrialist leading major corporate restructurings and expansions in manufacturing, housing, consumer\nproducts, retail and real estate enterprises. The Company represents the Principals’ sole vehicle for\nequity investment opportunities in the pre-K-12 sector going forward.\n\nThe Principals founded the Company and its affiliated companies over the past decade based on their\nvision of a world where competition for human capital? is becoming the driving force of economic\nprosperity. To remain competitive in the world economy, countries will be forced to invest heavily in the\ndevelopment of their human capital. The Principals believe that an investment made in an individual's\neducation, especially at a young age, is the most effective way to build human capital and thereby\nincrease that individual’s lifelong productivity. As the largest for-profit provider of ECE in the world, the\nCompany is well positioned to capitalize on these trends.\n\n’ The 12.4% minority position is held by various investors.\n\n? KUE’s ownership varies depending on the liquidation value or sale value of k12 and according to the preference of the various securities KUE owns,\nAt higher valuations, KUE's percentage ownership is lower, See “k12 Inc, (k12) — k12 Equity.”\n\n* The economic theory of Human Capital Policy was first published by University of Chicago professor James Heckman in Human Capital Policy, dated\nAugust 2002,\n\n19\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_024452\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

Though the two men had grown to respect each another over the\nyears, Rabin neither trusted, nor much liked, Shimon. In fact, though Peres’s\nsupport inside Labor had secured him the foreign ministry, Rabin had stipulated\nthat all peace talks would remain under his control.\n\nYet as I'd discover nearly a decade later, when I was Prime Minister, even\nthe most carefully planned negotiating strategies were always subject to\nsetbacks, diversions, or simply what former British Prime Minister Harold\nMacmillan once called “events, dear boy, events.” Rabin’s initial plan was not\nto start with the Palestinians. He did feel it was essential to try to reach a\npolitical settlement with them. In one respect, the prospects looked slightly\nbetter than before. Arafat’s political position had been weakened: first by an\nintifada driven as much by local insurgents as by the PLO in faraway Tunis, and\nthen by his decision to break with his longtime Gulf Arab financial supporters\nand support Saddam Hussein the Gulf War. In 1988, as the entry price for a\nformal dialogue with the Bush Administration, he had also agreed to a statement\nin which he renounced terrorism and accepted the principle of a two-state peace\nagreement with Israel. Still, there remained a yawning gap between the “self-\nrule” envisaged in the Camp David accords of 1978 and the Madrid conference,\nand the independent state the Palestinians wanted. Negotiations to bridge it were\nlikely to be fraught and long.\n\nSo he’d decided to begin with Syria. President Assad was obstinate, and\npublicly opposed to the idea of making peace with Israel. But he’d been in\npower for more than two decades and, crucially for Rabin, had lived up to the\nfew, indirect agreements Israel had made with him. The substance in any\nagreement, though politically difficult, was also more straightforward. We knew\nwhat Assad wanted: the recovery of the Golan Heights, in return for the\nabsolute minimum level of political normalization with Israel. We knew what\nwe wanted: security guarantees and assurances regarding water resources, and a\nfull and final peace treaty. For Rabin, there was an additional attraction in\nbeginning with Syria: if we did reach a deal with our main Arab enemy, the\npressure would intensify on the Palestinians to follow suit.\n\nThe dramatic turn of events that ultimately forced him to change tack began\nin January 1993 in the sitting room of a villa outside Oslo, at an ostensible\n“academic seminar” convened by the Norwegian diplomat Terje Larsen.

He walked me to the lift\nand told me go to the next level and my room was the first one on the\nright, it had an intercom in which he can contact me when needed.\n\nI hit number 5 on the lift and took his directions to my room. I opened\nthe door to this massive loft, the size of an adequate house. I walked\ndown the long hall and my eyes took in the magnificence of my\nsurroundings. It was a room fit for royalty, and later would find out had\nbeen stayed in by some. The room was trimmed in gold paint and had\nanother eerie tapestry on the main wall as feature.

As an adult, he created a robot to dance with: KUKA.\nTaiwanese dancer, choreographer, inventor, and videographer Huang Yi’s pioneering work is steeped in his fascination with the partnership\nbetween humans and robots. He interweaves continuous movement with mechanical and multimedia elements to create a form of dance\nwhich corresponds with the flow of data, effectively making the performer a dancing instrument. Named by Dance Magazine as one of the\n“25 to Watch,” Huang is one of Asia’s most prolific choreographers.\nHarmoniously weaving together the art of dance and the science of mechanical engineering, HUANG YI & KUKA is a poetic work that\nintertwines modern dance and visual arts with the realm of robotics, revealing humanity through a series of vignettes between live dancers\nand KUKA, a robot conceptualized and programmed by Huang. “Dancing face to face with a robot is like looking at my own face in a\nmirror...I think I have found the key to spin human emotions into robots,” Huang asserts.\nHUANG YI & KUKA is an original production of Huang Yi Studio +, developed at 3LD Art & Technology Center, in association with\nSozo Artists. Commissioned by Quanta Arts Foundation.\nfacebook.com/HuangYiStudio\nAnab Jain\nFuturist, designer\nSuperflux co-founder and TED Fellow Anab Jain parses uncertainties around our shared futures to create provocative experiences, tools\nand tactics that we can adopt today.\nIn 2009, Anab Jain co-founded the design firm Superflux with Jon Ardern, inspired by influences as far-flung as avant-garde architecture\nand Andrei Tarkovsky. The challenges Jain explores are some of the biggest -- climate change, biotech, intelligent machines -- and her\nresulting work “navigates the entangled wilderness of our technology, politics, culture and environment to imagine new ways of seeing,\nbeing and acting.”\nIn her work, Jain creates worlds, stories and tools that provoke and inspire us to engage with the precarity of our rapidly changing world.\nSuperflux is building tools, methods and commons that can enable us to mitigate the shock of food insecurity and climate change. Recently\nthey produced a series of civilian drones, and created a vision of a near-future city where these intelligent machines begin to display\nincreasing autonomy with civic society. Among Superflux’s previous projects is a headset allowing blind subjects injected with a lightsensitive\nvirus to develop a kind of “super-sight” sensitive to spectrums that ordinary vision cannot detect.\nsuperflux.in @anabjain\nGarry Kasparov\nhttps://ted2017.ted.com/program\nPage 1 of 21\nTED2017: The future you\n4/20/17, 12:07 PM\nGarry Kasparov\nGrandmaster, analyst\nGarry Kasparov is esteemed by many as the greatest chess player of all time. Now he’s engaged in a game with far higher stakes: the\npreservation of democracy.\nWhen 22-year-old Garry Kasparov became the world’s youngest chess Grand Champion, few could predict his turbulent career in chess or\nas a dissident. His chessboard wizardry was already the stuff of legend when, in 1997, he made headlines when he lost a rematch to IBM’s\nDeep Blue supercomputer, ushering AI into the public sphere.\nKasparov’s book Winter Is Coming details the rise of Putin’s Russia as well as Kasparov’s persecution and self-exile, and it serves chilling\nwarnings of reactionary forces gathering in the West. He is the chair of the Human Rights Foundation, succeeding his predecessor Vaclav\nHavel.\nkasparov.com @Kasparov63\nLaura Galante\nCyberspace analyst\nLaura Galante analyzes how states use cyberspace: a domain where militaries, intelligence services, criminal groups and individuals pursue\ntheir interests with far fewer restraints than in the physical world.\nAt FireEye, Galante's teams have profiled advanced cyber threats, investigated network breaches and portrayed the political, military and\nfinancial implications of cyber operations. Part of the original Mandiant Intelligence team, Galante has led strategic analysis, developed\nintelligence capabilities and offerings, and directed publications including APT28: A Window into Russia’s State Cyber Espionage; Red\nLine Drawn: China Recalculates its Use of Cyber Espionage; and Hacking the Street? FIN4 Likely Playing the Market among others.\nIn November 2016 she spoke at the UN Security Council’s Arria Formula meeting on cybersecurity and international peace and security.\nShe frequently appears on and provides commentary to: CNN, Bloomberg, NPR, BBC, Fox News, the New York Times, The Financial\nTimes, The Wall Street Journal, Reuters, the Associated Press and other global and industry media. Prior to her work at FireEye and\nMandiant, Galante led a contractor team analyzing cyber capability development and military doctrine at the US Department of Defense.\nShe supported the 2010 US-Russia bilateral information security talks.\nfireeye.com @LauraLGalante\nOK Go\nBand\nA wildly creative band of music- and video-makers, OK Go is building a media empire on the back of endless, boundless ingenuity.\nWith a career that includes award-winning videos, New York Times op-eds, a major label split and the establishment of a DIY trans-media\nmini-empire (Paracadute), collaborations with pioneering dance companies and tech giants, animators and Muppets, and an experiment that\naims to encode Hungry Ghosts on actual strands of DNA, OK Go continue to fearlessly dream and build new worlds in a time when\ncreative boundaries have all but dissolved.\nThe band has been honored with a Grammy, three MTV Video Music Awards (one of them from Japan!), a CLIO, three UK Music Video\nAwards, two Webby Awards (including one for their collaboration with The Muppets and Sesame Street) and a spot in a Guggenheim\ninstallation.

Following the success of his book, Ferriss has become a fulltime\nangel investor.\nTitus Kaphar\nArtist\nTitus Kaphar's artworks interact with the history of art by appropriating its styles and mediums.\nAs Titus Kaphar says of his work: “I’ve always been fascinated by history: art history, American history, world history, individual history -\n- how history is written, recorded, distorted, exploited, reimagined, and understood. In my work I explore the materiality of reconstructive\nhistory. I paint and I sculpt, often borrowing from the historical canon, and then alter the work in some way. I cut, crumple, shroud, shred,\nstitch, tar, twist, bind, erase, break, tear, and turn the paintings and sculptures I create, reconfiguring them into works that nod to hidden\nnarratives and begin to reveal unspoken truths about the nature of history.\"\nHis latest works are an investigation into the highest and lowest forms of recording history.

Historical portraiture, mug shots, and YouTube stills challenge viewers to consider how we document the past, and what we\nhave erased. Rather than explore guilt or innocence, Kaphar engages the narratives of individuals and how we as a society manage and\ndefine them over time. As a whole, this exhibition explores the power of rewritten histories to question the presumption of innocence and\nthe mythology of the heroic.\nkapharstudio.com\nRabbi Lord Jonathan Sacks\nReligious leader\nIn a world violently polarized by extremists, Rabbi Lord Jonathan Sacks is proposing and advocating solutions to mounting religious\nintolerance.\nRabbi Lord Sacks is one of Judaism’s spiritual leaders, and he exercises a primary influence on the thought and philosophy of Jews and\npeople of all faiths worldwide. Since stepping down as Chief Rabbi of the UK and Commonwealth in 2013, Rabbi Lord Sacks has become\nan increasingly well-known speaker, respected moral voice and writer; his 2015 book is Not in God's Name: Confronting Religious\nViolence.\nGranted a seat in the British House of Lords in 2009, Rabbi Lord Sacks is a key Jewish voice for universalism and an embrace of tolerance\nbetween religions and cultures. He rejects the “politics of anger” brought about by the way “we have acted as if markets can function\nwithout morals, international corporations without social responsibility and economic systems without regard to their effect on the people\nleft stranded by the shifting tide.\" He also sees, as a key idea for faith in our times, that unity in heaven creates diversity on earth.\nrabbisacks.org @rabbisacks\nTuesday, April 25, 8:30AM - 10:15AM PDT\nSession 2: Our Robotic Overlords\nHosted by Chris Anderson and Helen Walters.\nMarc Raibert\nRoboticist\nMarc Raibert is the founder and CEO of robot maker Boston Dynamics.\nWorking with his team at Boston Dynamics, Marc Raibert builds some of the world’s most advanced robots, such as BigDog, Atlas, Spot\nand Handle.

His family fled, eventually resettling in High\nPoint, North Carolina. Raj dreamed of going to medical school and, as a student in 2005, he returned to Liberia. He was shocked to find a\nhealth care system in total devastation. Only 50 doctors remained to treat a population of four million.\nWith a small team of Liberian civil war survivors, American health workers and $6,000 he'd received as a wedding gift, Panjabi cofounded\nLast Mile Health in 2007. Initially focused on care for HIV patients, Last Mile Health has grown into a robust organization that\npartners with the government of Liberia to recruit, train, equip and employ community health care workers who provide a wide range of\nservices to their neighbors in Liberia's most remote regions. In 2016, Last Mile Health workers treated 50,000 patients, including nearly\n22,000 cases of malaria, pneumonia and diarrhea in children. While the organization focuses on integrated primary care, its network can be\nleveraged in a crisis. In the fight against Ebola, Last Mile Health supported government response by training 1,300 health workers in\nsoutheastern Liberia.\nPanjabi is a physician in the Division of Global Health Equity at Harvard Medical School, Brigham and Women's Hospital and an advisor\nto the Clinton Global Initiative.

In his work, he asks questions like: How can a 225-year-old\nconstitutional blueprint still work? Can you design a new and better constitution from scratch in places like Iraq and Tunisia? What rights\ndo we have, really?\nFeldman is the Felix Frankfurter Professor of Law at Harvard Law School and a contributing writer for Bloomberg View. He served as\nsenior constitutional advisor to the Coalition Provisional Authority in Iraq, and advised members of the Iraqi Governing Council on the\ndrafting of the Transitional Administrative Law or interim constitution. He is writing a biography on James Madison, principal author of\nthe Constitution and fourth president of the US; it's forthcoming in 2017.\nFeldman is the author of six other books: Cool War: The Future of Global Competition (Random House, 2013); Scorpions: The Battles and\nTriumphs of FDR’s Great Supreme Court Justices (Twelve Publishing, 2010); The Fall and Rise of the Islamic State (Princeton University\nPress, 2008); Divided By God: America's Church-State Problem and What We Should Do About It (Farrar, Straus & Giroux 2005); What\nWe Owe Iraq: War and the Ethics of Nation building (Princeton University Press 2004) and After Jihad: America and the Struggle for\nIslamic Democracy (Farrar, Straus & Giroux 2003.

She is known for being a cast member on Saturday Night Live from\n1990 to 1995, where she created and popularized the androgynous character, Pat. She is also well known for her comedic and dramatic\nmonologues. God Said Ha! is a monologue about serious illness, her brother's lymphoma and her own cancer, and her family's crazy\nreactions to this crisis as they soldiered their way through struggle, confusion and death. This play was performed all over the U.S. and on\nBroadway at the Lyceum Theater. It was made into a film produced by Quentin Tarantino, and the comedy album from the show was\nnominated for a Grammy.\nSweeney's second monologue, In the Family Way, played in theatrical runs in New York and Los Angeles. It was ultimately fashioned into\na book, a memoir titled If It's Not One Thing, It's Your Mother. Sweeney's third monologue, Letting Go of God, chronicled her journey from\nCatholicism to atheism.

The way we’re\ndesigned resides in one of the oldest and most conserved parts of the genome, called the\nHox genes. These are genes that regulate genes, in what are called developmental\nprograms. Nothing in your genome stores the design of your body; your genome stores,\nrather, a series of steps to follow that results in your body. This is an exact parallel to\nhow search is done in AI. There are too many possible body plans to search over, and\nmost modifications would be either inconsequential or fatal. The Hox genes are a\nrepresentation of a productive place for evolutionary search. It’s a kind of natural\nintelligence at the molecular level.\n\nAI has a mind-body problem, in that it has no body. Most work on AI is done in\nthe cloud, running on virtual machines in computer centers where data are funneled. Our\nown intelligence is the result of a search algorithm (evolution) that was able to change\nour physical form as well as our programming—those are inextricably linked. Ifthe\nhistory of AI can be understood as the working of scaling laws rather than a succession of\nfashions, then its future can be seen in the same way. What’s now being digitized, after\ncommunication and computation, is fabrication, bringing the programmability of bits to\nthe world of atoms. By digitizing not just designs but the construction of materials, the\nsame lessons that von Neumann and Shannon taught us apply to exponentially increasing\nfabricational complexity.\n\nI’ve defined digital materials to be those constructed from a discrete set of parts\nreversibly joined with a discrete set of relative positions and orientations. These\nattributes allow the global geometry to be determined from local constraints, assembly\nerrors to be detected and corrected, heterogeneous materials to be joined, and structures\nto be disassembled rather than disposed of when they’re no longer needed. The amino\nacids that are the foundation of life and the Lego bricks that are the foundation of play\nshare these properties.\n\nWhat’s interesting about amino acids is that they’re not interesting. They have\nattributes that are typical but not unusual, such as attracting or repelling water. But just\ntwenty types of them are enough to make you. In the same way, twenty or so types of\ndigital-material part types—conducting, insulating, rigid, flexible, magnetic, etc —are\nenough to assemble the range of functions that go into making modern technologies like\nrobots and computers.\n\nThe connection between computation and fabrication was foreshadowed by the\nvery pioneers whose work the edifice of computing is based on. Wiener hinted at this by\nlinking material transportation with message transportation. John von Neumann is\ncredited with modern computer architecture, something he actually wrote very little\nabout; the final thing he studied, and wrote about beautifully and at length, was self-\nreproducing systems. As an abstraction of life, he modeled a machine that can\ncommunicate a computation that constructs itself. And the final thing Alan Turing, who\nis credited with the theoretical framework for computer science, studied was how the\ninstructions in genes can give rise to physical forms.

Nothing else matters. We don’t get China right, we don’t get\nanything right. This whole thing is very simple. China is where Nazi Germany was in\n1929 to 1930.

Ailes, since his ouster from Fox,\nhad become only more bitter towards Murdoch. Now Murdoch was frequently jawboning\nthe president-elect and encouraging him toward establishment moderation—all a strange\ninversion in the ever-stranger currents of American conservatism. Bannon wanted Ailes to\nsuggest to Trump, a man whose many neuroses included a horror of forgetfulness or\nsenility, that Murdoch might be losing it.\n\n“Tll call him,” said Ailes. “But Trump would jump through hoops for Rupert.

Finkelstein had never published any scholarship. Moreover, he had been dismissed by\nBrooklyn College for abusing students who disagreed with his extremist views and had engaged in\nsexist behavior at DePaul. Not exactly a strong record for tenure. But he had something going\nfor him. He was so vitriolically anti-Israel, that he had many radical supporters who cared more\nabout his politics than his scholarship. He also argued that most people who claim to be victims\nof the Holocaust—including Elie Wiesel—were “frauds” and “liars” and that the Holocaust itself\nwas being exaggerated for political and financial reasons. By falsely claiming that those opposed\nto his tenure were motivated by his political views on Israel and the Holocaust, rather than his\nlack of scholarship, he hoped to bestow on himself the mantle of victimhood to a conspiracy of\nZionist-McCarthyites. I exposed his tactic in the Wall Street Journal by comparing it to the ploy\nused by Mary McCarthy’ fictionalized failed academic who, realizing he wouldn’t get tenure,\nbecame a communist so that he could claim that he was being denied tenure because he was a Red\nrather than a lousy scholar:\n\n“Facing tenure denial, Mr. Finkelstein opted for a tactic that fit the times.

They regard him as a scholar in a class with Ward Churchill. He’s the\nColorado professor who called the 9/11 victims “little Eichmanns” comparing Finkelstein\nto Churchill is a characterization with which I would not quarrel.\n\nMr. Finkelstein does not do “scholarship” in any meaningful sense. Although his writings\ncenter on Israel (which he compares to Nazi Germany) and the Holocaust, he has never\nvisited Israel and cannot read or speak German — precluding the possibility of original\nscholarship.\n\nProf. Bartov characterized his work as an irrational Jewish “conspiracy theory.” The\nconspirators include Steven Spielberg, NBC and Leon Uris. The film “Schindler’s List,”\nMr. Finkelstein argues, was designed to divert attention from our Mideast policy. “Give\nme a better reason! .. . Who profits? Basically, there are two beneficiaries from the\ndogmas [of Schindler's List]: American Jews and American administration.” NBC, he says,\nbroadcast “Holocaust” to strengthen Israel’s position: “In 1978, NBC produced the series\nHolocaust. Do you believe, it was a coincidence, 1978? Just at this time, when peace\nnegotiations between Israel and Egypt took place in Camp David?” He argues that Leon\nUris, the author of “Exodus,” named his character “Ari” in order to promote Israel’s\n“Nazi” ideology: “[B]ecause Ari is the diminutive for Aryan. It is the whole admiration for\nthis blond haired, blue eyed type.” (Ari is a traditional Hebrew name dating back to the\nBible.) He has blamed Sept. 11 on the U.S., claiming that we “deserve the problem on our\nhands because some things Bin Laden says are true.”) He says that most alleged Holocaust\nsurvivors — including Elie Wiesel — have fabricated their past.\n\nLike other anti-Semites, Mr. Finkelstein generalizes about “the Jews”; for example: “Just\nas Israelis . . . courageously put unruly Palestinians in their place, so American Jews\n\n147\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_017234\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

I was so over-joyed with excitement, what girl my age with a\nbackground like mine was attending socialite parties and globetrotting the\nworld. It only made it harder for me to see beyond the elusive walls I had\nput up to protect myself from the appalling truth.\n\nWe left in early April first going to London, Paris and then our final\ndestination being St. Tropez in Southern France. If Hallmark had a\npostcard, St. Tropez would definitely be on the front of it. It was beautiful\nspring weather and every where you looked women were dressed in\nbikini tops branded with some kind of designer label embedded into it\nand the men were following them around like harping dogs in heat. In all\nof the elegance of the Mediterranean, “La Bastide De St. Tropez” was an\nimpressive landmark. Jeffrey and Ghislane were staying in one of the\nprivate cottages, on the park on the grounds, while Emmy and I stayed in\nseparate quarters inside the hotel. The old style cobblestone streets were\nlined with boutique shops and beauty parlors. It was the hedonistic\nstomping grounds of the beyond rich and famous.\n\nThe next day we went out to lunch at the grand opening of the\ninfamous Nikki Beach Club, where a cheap glass of champagne costs\naround two hundred dollars and if your not keeping the alcohol\nconsumption flowing like water, you’d be asked to leave to make way for\nthe constant flow of prospectus patrons. That’s where I first got to meet\nNaomi Campbell. She was wearing the typical attire strutting around\nsouthern France, a D&G bikini top and a wrap around mini skirt to go\nover the swimsuits bikini. She was so tall and stunningly beautiful. Her\ncharisma was energetic, funny, and everyone seemed to hang off of her\nevery word and laugh at her every joke. Ghislane and Jeffrey kissed her\ncheeks and wished her a happy birthday, and then I was introduced and\nfollowed in their suit. She was surrounded by a league of assistants,\nfriends and fans, which didn’t make it easy for us to all converse but she\ngot enough time in to invite us abroad a yacht of a fellow she was “kind\nof seeing” at the time for the before party ahead of tonight’s event. We\nwent back to the hotel and I gave Jeffrey a massage in his room before we\nall headed down to the pool to soak in some of the year’s first sun’s rays.\n\nI loved wearing my new ball gown and feeling like a princess. It was\nabsolutely sensational and made me feel as if I floated in the dress. I\nswept up my long hair in a twisted clip, only letting down a few curly\nstrands and layered on the mascara. Receiving many compliments\nthroughout the evening when we eventually left the Yacht to make our\nappearance at the main birthday bash, I couldn’t help but feel excitement\nfor the party to come it was the first celebrity birthday bash I had ever\nbeen to. Being introduced to model after model and the rich men that\nfollowed them around became dizzying. Jeffrey sat back and watched as I\nbuoyantly worked the dance floor, coming back to the table where he\n\n65\n\n|! Copyright Protected Material\nCONFIDENTIAL GIUFFRE004198\n\nwas, only to grab another glass of champagne every now and then. Every\nso often he’d introduce to me to someone new, pulling me aside to show\noff his eager young masseuse to his fellow pedo’s. These people had so\nmuch money pouring out of them. I don’t know why he even thought\nthey’d care in the first place. It made me feel good though. At least I\nknew I made him proud to have me in his company.\n\nBeing surrounded by so many of Jeffrey’s colleagues and his\nlikeminded people that were considered the most sophisticated and the\nhighly esteemed of today’s world nearly made the way I was living lately\nmore fathomable, at least to myself. | thought if everyone looks up to\nthese people and they are all accepting of it, it must be just the way the\nworld turns. I danced with a young prince that night and with all of the\nhelp from the bubbly champagne [ couldn’t remember his name for the\nlife of me. On one of my trips back to the table for another glass, Jeffrey\nleaned over to quietly whisper in my ear that it was a prince that I had\nactually been dancing with and | didn’t phase me in the least way. | went\nback to the dance floor and continued to let my hair down. [t was a fun\nbash, the entire crowd sang “Happy Birthday” to Naomi and by the time\nwe got back in the car to retreat for the night, I was giddy from the\ndrinking and dancing all evening. We had a guest in the car, and\napparently we had already been introduced, but I couldn’t even remember\nhis name in the first five minutes of our meeting again. He was the hotel\nowner of some large chain in America called “Hilton”. Staying at one of\nthe cottages near Jeffrey, he saw it quaint to loan me out for a night’s\nmassage to ruin an “almost” perfect evening. Jeffrey told me to come\nback to his room after I was finished with Rick, thankfully he reminded\nme of his name but also odd | thought, being so late 1 would’ve never\nimagined Jeffrey could stay up this late but | never made a fuss out of his\nrequests. I gave him affirmation of my understood instructions and\nheaded off with this stranger into the darkness.\n\nI dimmed the bright lights in his bedroom to a softer tone as if it might\naid the vision of this short, balding man with straggling remnants of curly\nbrown hair left to show for the remaining bits of youth left in him. | had\nto ask him to undress and lay on top of the towel that I had picked up\nfrom the neatly folded pile at the end of his bed and spread it over the\nduvet. I didn’t want to waste a second in his place, getting right to the\nvery reason I was even there.

My attorneys and PR people advised me to just stay quiet, and it will all go away.  I have received the same advice for five years now.  I realize my silence is now causing collateral damage to my friends and other innocent bystanders.  The time has come to let the hounds of investigative reporters loose on those that, driven by money, have made false claims, concocted malicious fabrications, and have expanded their fictions now to include others in my orbit.\n\nI was investigated for soliciting underage prostitutes.  To be precise, girls under the age of 18 who were brought to my house by their close friends who worked in local massage parlors or strip clubs(West Palm Beach has scores of massage parlors and happy ending places that routinely advertise in the same local papers that have chastised my behavior)[ see Palm Beach Post classifieds]. I am and have always been a bachelor.  I have used massage parlor women, licensed massage therapists, and women with no massage experience.  I have never ever used force, coercion, or in fact had intercourse with any of these women. \n When the police investigated me, went through my garbage, searched my house, they found sex toys, but NO cameras or camera equipment; nothing in fact out of the ordinary from many homes of single men.  There were never any photos of underage girls. Never.  A careful reading of any law enforcement document makes that clear. The camera that was referred to in the search warrant, was the camera installed in my house with the help of the local police to catch my houseman, John Allessi; the same houseman mentioned in many articles.  He was breaking into my house and stealing money after being fired. The camera caught him in the act. These cameras were the only cameras at my house; security cameras.  \nThe local state attorney, after conducting an extensive investigation and interviewing the girls herself, a sex crimes prosecutor with over 13 years experience, and who had herself authored the more tough legislations dealing with sex crimes, said in her own words, “There are no real victims here. The girls knew they were going to a house in Palm Beach, they had their boyfriends or family members drive them to the house and wait outside, and then they encouraged their friends to go.” Many of the girls interviewed were in their mid twenties, some in their early thirties, and some younger than 18. The girl that the newspapers have referred to as a fourteen year old told the police that she had repeatedly told me that she was 18 and a senior in high school, like many of the massage parlor girls told me, and in her own words to the police, said the reason she said she was 18 was that she was told if she didn’t, MR EPSTEIN would not let her in the house.  These reports are available. \n  The state attorney offered me to take a plea to aggravated assault with only probation. My attorneys told me that it would be forever a blight on my record, and I should refuse the deal.  I did so.  The state attorney, Barry Krisher, took the unusual step of bringing the facts before a state grand jury.  In Florida, this happens most often in capital murder cases, not prostitution in someone’s own home.  To be certain that the public would not criticize the outcome, the state grand jury was given all the evidence and returned a verdict of Solicitation of Prostitution.  Solicitation, a non-registrable offense which carries with it a sentence of mandatory probation.  Mandatory probation; solicitation is one of the few statues that has such a designation.  The local police chief, however, met this charge with great disdain. He believed something untoward had gone on for the grand jury to return such a mild verdict after his department had spent hundreds of thousands of dollars examining the behavior of a resident that rarely left his house. Women seemed to come and go, women of ALL ages.  Some masseuses interviewed were in their sixties, some were men.  \n  The police chief, unhappy with the decision of twelve Florida citizens that weighed the evidence, took the unprecedented step of releasing the raw police reports to the press. The raw sewage of an investigation not corroborated, or as it turns out, not even transcribed from the actual interview tapes correctly. Before a plea to the indictment was entered and the case was still open, he released the reports and then sent a letter off to the parents of some of the girls and to the FBI asking for their assistance. Only two days after the grand jury decided that I should only be charged with solicitation of prostitution, NOT underage women, not pimping, but using prostitutes as a john, I received my first FEDERAL subpoena.  What resulted after a thirteen month investigation and can be read in my non prosecution agreement, was the federal government threatened me with a fifty page indictment alleging that I had broken federal law, though all actions took place in my home in Florida, the women were from Florida, and no interstate travel took place.  The AUSA said that my secretary had made telephone calls to the women.  Many of those calls were return calls, and the use of the telephone by my secretary to confirm massage appointments, was equivalent federally to some guy surfing the internet, knowing full well that the person on the other end of the connection is under age, and trying to coerce them into some illegal sex activity. The internet luring statute says that someone uses the means of interstate commerce, (in my case it was a phone) to knowingly coerce underage persons into sex. This was the first time in history that this statute would be stretched, twisted beyond all recognition in an attempt to threaten prosecution. I had hired Ken Starr, former Solicitor General; Alan Dershowitz, law professor; Roy Black, trial attorney; Joe Whitley, former assistant attorney general; and Guy Lewis former US attorney in South Florida, to defend me against what each one of them had said was no federal crime.  Ken Starr wrote a brief using a federalism argument that made it clear that my crime of being a john could not be a federal crime. It was to no avail.  What the federal government required was as follows: They required that my defense team, not the feds, but my team, go to the state attorney and ask that he up my charge to a pimping charge; a charge that carried with it sex registration. They would not give him the facts to support that charge, or give me evidence they said they had that I had under Florida law received money FROM these girls to offer them out as prostitutes. Florida law is very clear, that the pimp must have a financial benefit from the crime. It would be our responsibility to ask the state attorney to up my charge and agree to sentence me to 18 months in jail and a year of house arrest.  In the history of the state attorneys office, they have no other instance of someone requesting a higher charge than what the grand jury decided and a harsher penalty.\nIn addition, the federal government would require me to pay a minimum of $50,000 to each woman on a list of women that they would choose.   A list that would be kept secret; no names on their list would be disclosed to my attorneys or myself until I was already firmly in a jail cell. A list that we would not only be obliged to pay money to, but if any of the women did not accept the $50,000, I would be required to pay an attorney, chosen by the government, to represent the women to enable them to sue me; I would have to pay their attorney fees.  I would be given the names of the women after being in jail, would not be allowed to appeal this deal, pay women, some of whom I had never even met, and if I chose to fight this deal, I would be threatened over and over with being in breach of my agreement. The attorney chosen by the government to represent these women hired his own daughter, a sitting state prosecutor, who received special leave to represent these women, and though she continued to receive her state salary, billed me over $800,000 in a period of one year to represent women suing me. When my side raised objections, we were told that if we fought this, the government would declare a breach of my agreement and indict me.  The AUSA actually filed an affidavit with the court that stated that “The protection from the government that Epstein thought he bargained for really is “illusory”, we can always bring a case against him for the live span of any woman we think has been a victim.” \n\nAfter serving my sentence, I was sued by many women on the government list.  During many of the depositions taken in those cases, the women admitted to the following: they had many other clients, they got paid thousands of dollars a week to work in the local massage parlors and sex clubs, they kept their list of johns in their Bible. Many had abusive boyfriends and abortions way before they ever met me, though they claimed sex assault abuse and various other sex claims. Most later brought their best friends to the house who also claimed the same abuse in the hopes of getting money.\n\nWith what the newspapers had called a dream team, each and every lawyer, when they saw the result of the negotiations, said with incredulity, “We have never seen anything like this before”. I had never left my house and the women had not traveled on my planes or to another state.  I had never made money off of these women. I was a consumer of prostitution, a john. The government said that they could invoke a statute for travel for the purpose of sex, which would be the equivalent to tourists who sign on to fake web sites advertising sex with minors in Cambodia, Thailand and other third world countries. The government said that they could charge me with traveling to Florida to have sex with an underage girl, even though sex with 16 year olds is legal in New Jersey and Pennsylvania and sex with 17 year olds is legal in New York. They suggested that they would indict me for traveling to Florida FOR THE PURPOSE of having sex with minors.  Not withstanding the fact that I had a home in Florida for 15 years, regularly traveled to see my brother, mother and business associates.  They said that they thought a novel application could at least get me indicted, unless I took the state plea deal.  I had little choice.  The crimes they alleged, no matter what the likelihood of success, carried with them a minimum mandatory 10-year sentence.   I recognize that I am not a sympathetic figure, and had to decide whether to risk a trial where the jury would see an older man and young women that would be paraded in Sunday school outfits during the trial.\n\nI have shown poor judgment in the past, and have paid a heavy price for those mistakes.  I had hoped to move forward with my science philanthropy and helping those less privileged than myself.  Then came Scott Rothstein.\n\n\n\nScott Rothstein was the senior partner of RRA . He is currently serving a 50 -year prison sentence for perpetrating the largest fraud in South Florida’s history.   He decided that sex allegations made against me could be used to fleece hundreds of investors out of hundreds of millions of dollars.  He recruited Brad Edwards, a smalltime Ft. Lauderdale attorney who had access to some of the women on the government list.  Rothstein forged Judges signatures, hid behind attorney client privilege, secrecty of legal docu, work product, cover letter; giving illegal investigative activity the protection normally reserved for lawyers and their legitimate clients.   He falsely told investors that I had settled cases with him for hundreds of millions of dollars, but the women wanted their money right away.  If they gave him 30 million dollars now, he could give part of it to the women who wanted to remain anonymous, they would go off into the sunset with their money, and the full payment would be made to the investors.  Investors that would be getting 50- 100% return on their money for taking advantage of the same women who allegedly had come in contact with me. Bill Schere, an attorney in Broward, has filed 147 complaints against Scott Rothstein and the firm. \n\nThe attorney for the women, aware that I would be loathe in involve innocent friends in problems that were strictly of my own making, subpoenaed names and tried to smear any friend  or mine whose name appeared in print previously. They contacted Bill Clinton, Donald Trump, David Copperfield; innocent bystanders with no knowledge of any of my actions whatsoever. I settled the cases rather than forcing both the women and others to be subject to a public questioning of their lives. \n\nIt appears that the Rothstein firm had continuing help from the government throughout their civil litigations. Emails received as a result of a recent subpoena show descriptions such as, “received info from current FBI agents”. \n\nThe former Rothstein partners subpoenaed my attorney for all correspondence regarding my plea with the US attorney.  Though highly unusual, the government sided with the former Rothstein partners and agreed we needed to produce all the correspondence between the government and my attorneys.  \n\nDuring the civil deposition of my former houseman, Alfredo Rodriguez, attended by a new attorney from the Rothstein firm, whose name appears on the record as CARA Holmes, [also appears as Carolyn Holmes, also appears as Kara Holmes], the houseman allegedly said that he had stolen a book from my house with telephone numbers in it that the government wanted. This was in July of 2009.  I believe that the attorneys went to outside counsel Kendall Coffey, and asked whether or not they could buy the book for the $50,000 that the houseman had asked for it.  THREE months later, the FBI and the same AUSA that had headed my prosecution set up my houseman in a sting. It appears that while using a lawyer from the RRA firm, Brad Edwards, as a confidential informant for the government at the same time that Scott Rothstein was using me and the allegations against me to fleece his victims, the US attorneys’ office was sitting in the Rothstein offices planning a sting operation, while right next door, Scott Rothstein was making off to Morocco in an attempt to flee the country.  Alfredo Rodriguez was prosecuted by the same AUSA and received an 18- month sentence; however, it also appeared that on the very same day of his sting arrest, he bought an illegal gun, and was later sentenced to four years in prison.  Who Cara Holmes is, and what her role was in RRA is still a mystery to us. She appears to be a former FBI agent out of the Chicago office.  She joined the Rothstein firm in May of 2009, and joined the Florida Bar at the same time. She attended depositions of my pilots and my houseman. She communicated regularly with Brad Edwards and the investigators on my case.  The email traffic is extensive. \n\n The telephone book that Alfredo Rodriguez had stolen from my house was then turned over(by the government?) to the same attorneys who had been told they could not buy it as they would have been buying stolen property.  Brad Edwards, the former partner of Scott Rothstein, then used the purloined book to send out letters to everyone in the book, asking for additional stories of my wrongdoing in the past five years with the hopes of getting new clients. The letter was structured so as to circumvent the ethical rules regarding trolling for clients. \n\n\n\nWhile I was serving my sentence, my lawyers were able to come see me in jail. Only two months after being incarcerated, my in house lawyer came to see me to tell me that we were now conducting an audit of legal fees paid to date. They had discovered that Gerald Lefcourt, my primary defense attorney, had taken out cash to the tune of $800,000, that according to his own accountant, he was not entitled to.   He had simply prepared invoices that said, “Please pay another $100,000 or $200,000”. Though he had been asked on multiple occasions to substantiate the bills, his response would be, “We are working full time for you”. I pointed out that his was not the only firm working for me, but he replied, “Would you like me to quit?”  He eventually returned over $400,000 over a period of time, as he said that his cash flow could not handle the strain. He said that he was still owed for things like taxi fair, coffee and doughnuts, detailed for $2.53, and would keep $400,000.\n\n\nI was told that I should hire Guy Lewis, a former US Attorney in the Southern District. Lewis, a southern style gentleman; white suits, fast cars; said he had a great relationship with the current US Attorney, Alex Acosta, and the people in Washington that would potentially need to review what ever happened in South Florida. He wanted a $100,000 per month retainer, and with this, his partner Mike Tein would represent me. Upon review of Lewis’ background, it was suggested that he might now not have the credibility that he had represented, and rumors were that he had been asked to leave the Department of Justice for inappropriate billing.  I told him in no uncertain terms that if this were true he would need to tell me, as he was representing my credibility with the government. If he had been asked to leave the Department of Justice, it would dramatically hurt my chances if it were he making my case to senior officials.  He swore up and down, as southerners are apt to do, that there was no truth whatsoever to the allegations.  Being charged with untrue allegations rang close to my heart, and I chose to side with Lewis. Only after my incarceration, when Lewis and Tein came to see me in a 9’x 10’ attorney room that smelled of urine, and I told them that I was now being sued by many of the girls on the government list, they expressed their regrets and their willingness to help. However, as they walked out down the dungeon like hall with the sound of clanging gates in the background, they were unaware of the security cameras and microphones throughout the hallway. They chose to high-five one another on camera and smile with the comment, “This is going to be a couple more years of fees”.  The guards at the jail, accustomed to some of the most heinous physical crimes imaginable, and hardened against most of humanity’s foibles, were caught off guard by the exhilaration of the potential of more fees.\n\n\nSex for money; it’s a sensitive subject. The reactions range from Andrew Dworkin the feminist who considers all intercourse a form of rape; man inserting his authority, to Jackie Mason that posits that when a man takes a woman for dinner, many times his real motivation is the hope of receiving sex at the end of the evening.  He suggests it is hypocritical for the man to be able to pay the florist for flowers, the doorman for getting a cab, the restaurant for the food, and the liquor store for the gift of wine, but can’t pay the only person that performs the actual sex act without committing a crime.  Yes, I paid for sex.  I am a john.  Yes, I understand that prostitution is a crime and a crime that very few johns have even gone to jail for.  I am aware that there are strong feelings amongst many people regarding that crime. Many countries have legalized it, some states have legalized it; many have a policy of no enforcement.  New York City has escort services that openly advertise, massage parlors that have neon signs in midtown. In actual fact, the crime of paying for sex at the time of my transgressions was under penal code 230; equivalent to that of jay walking unless the girl was under 15.  Yes, under the age of 15. That was in New York. In Florida, the age of consent is 18. Misrepresentation of age is not considered a defense. Even if the girl worked in a sex establishment where one has to prove age to work, if the girl was met in a bar where the drinking age is 21, or shows ID that appears to be valid that she is over 18, that is not a defense. The State Attorneys who deal with this sort of crime on a regular basis reviewed the case brought by the local police, and said in no uncertain terms that there “were no real victims “ in the Epstein case.  NO real victims. Their words; they said the women knew what they were doing. They even brought their best friends to Epstein’s house after going there a number of times themselves. How could there be a serious crime?\n\n\n\nThe AUSA decided that she would protect the young women of Palm Beach. She saw a need for child safety everywhere she looked.  She has been chastised twice by local judges for hiding information from and misleading the court, and had a supervisor represent her in front of a judge that would have disciplined her.  Her first subpoena to me asked for all my tax returns, my medical records, my phone book, my plane logs.   \n\nThe women came to my house. I usually exercised every day followed by a massage.  Most of the time, I would be on the telephone when a woman was brought into the room. Many times they rubbed my feet or back. I never spoke to them at all, because I would be on the phone. The room was dimmed, and often I would not even see the woman.  If not on the phone, I would talk to the woman. NO intercourse ever occurred; most women testified they never touched my genitals at all.  NEVER.  These depositions were taken as a result of the government supported civil suits against me. \n\n\n\n\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

Mary thought it would be a good idea to share this with our clients given the events of the day.\n\n \n\n“Here is what I plan to say at our Aspen Insights conference tomorrow about today’s events.  The last two weeks have been a severe setback for financial markets and the global recovery.\n\n \n\n[1] Today, Italian equity markets sold off sharply and were eventually shut down after the ECB (for now) rejected being the buyer of last resort for Italian government bonds, as the markets were hoping.  The Bundesbank apparently has objections to the idea.  This is a problem: Italy has issued around as much public debt as Germany, but is a considerably smaller country with almost twice the debt load as a percentage of its GDP.  Absent a decision by Germany to move to Federalism or a lot more debt monetization by the ECB, the European Monetary Union (as it is currently configured) could be facing its final stretch.  Today’s reported move by Italian regulators to seize documents at Moody’s regarding declines in Italian bank stocks is an indication of the pressure the system is under, and the possible search for scapegoats.  I don’t think you will find a firm that has written more often and more direly about the structural inconsistencies of the EMU than we have (I have a 2-year bibliography of what we said and when, if anyone wants it).  The “Sick Men of Europe” paper from February 2010 and “Don Quixote Thanksgiving” from November 2010 go into the greatest detail on why.  Our concerns sky-rocketed upon Greece’s financial disclosures in November 2009, after which we took portfolio decisions to back that up, purging exposures to the GIPSI countries from our credit, government bond and equity portfolios.  Since early 2010, our underweight positions in Europe represent the largest regional underweights we have ever held.\n\n \n\n[2] Will there be another recession in the US?  Our friend Marty Feldstein at Harvard puts the odds at 50-50.  Sell side and buy side economists missed last month’s US economic rollover by a country mile, so I am not sure how much weight to put in their current forecasts.  Most summarily dismissed our concerns that the recovery earlier this year had elements of a stimulus-driven mirage.  Bridgewater Associates was the only firm we spoke to that consistently highlighted the broader process of household deleveraging; and cautioned that when stimulus faded, so would the US economy, given the weakness in household income.  Their insights have been invaluable to us in terms of not stepping into this and taking too much risk prematurely during the three market swoons this year.   Our central scenario for the US in 2012 is not another recession, but low growth in the 2.0%  range, which is enough of a problem given the low job creation that entails.  Note that the CBO assumes growth rates of 3.0% to 3.6% over the next few years in their analyses of future US federal debt levels. \n\n \n\n[3] Do not blame today’s events on the debt ceiling debate, US politicians or European regulators.  If we get to the point where economic and profit fundamentals in a given market or region are not sustainable on their own, then we should be underweight that region (as in Europe).  Owning an asset class under the assumption that there will always be a “Lord of the Flies” type rescue from Central Banks and Treasuries is very risky, and historically, fraught with failure.  I remember similar logic in the summer of 1998, when the accepted mantra was that the US would bail out Russia and Boris Yeltsin, since President Clinton would not want to see a nuclear power like Russia slide back into Soviet rule, or anarchy (that view turned out to be wrong).   Anyone market-weight European risk out of the expectation that “Trichet and Merkel will fix surely it” is taking a binary risk that impossible to handicap.  Similarly, we should not start buying anything just because we think Qe3 is coming in the US (in the form of securities purchases, a permanently controlled long bond, etc). \n\n \n\n[4] When we began this year, I made the following decision: we would risk underperforming if there was a strong equity rally, out of concerns about the macroeconomic landscape (weakness in the West, inflation in the East).  As a result, we have held less equity exposure than usual for a period of high margins, low P/E multiples and strong earnings.  Instead, we’ve held larger exposures to investment grade and high yield credit, and hedge funds.  Over the last couple of years, our hedge funds (long-short funds with low net positions, macro hedge funds, distressed credit) have helped cushion portfolio returns when markets declined.  We won’t know until the data comes in, but we expect the same to happen this time.\n\n \n\n[5] The “Eye on the Market” has endlessly chronicled this year the fissures which are now affecting financial markets: European sovereign risk and inadequate bank capitalization; weak labor compensation as an Achilles heel of the US profits recovery, given its negative impact on spending; the political divide in Congress over how to deal with falling government revenue and rising entitlement spending; inflation risks in Asia and Latin America and the resulting need for more policy tightening; and the mixed track record of low interest rates to sustainability solve structural problems.  The cover of the 2011 Outlook (a printing press, out of control) expressed our concern regarding a recovery built upon a stimulus machine.   I would contrast this with the cover of a competitor’s 2011 publication, which had a picture of George Washington crossing the Delaware, with the caption “America’s structural resilience, fortitude and ingenuity will carry the economy and financial markets in 2011 – and beyond”.   Our job is not to point to where we would like the financial markets to go, but rather to point to where they might end up.  It’s like the scene in Oliver Stone’s Nixon, when Nixon looks up at a portrait of JFK and says, “When they look at you, they see what they want to be. When they look at me, they see what they are.”  Our job is to see financial markets for what they are.\n\n \n\n[6] All that said, we have lessons to learn here.    \n\n \n\nToo many of our investment discussions this year focused on the negative real return characteristics of cash, and why to reduce it.   In a world of deflation risk on financial assets (rather than of goods and services), cash retains substantial option value at times like these.  \n\n \n\nWe could have connected the dots more aggressively on our views on weak growth and easy monetary policy, and owned more gold.  While we have had rising price forecasts for gold and owned it in portfolios, we did not have large enough allocations. \n\n \n\nGiven the all-time high of US government transfers to households and negative real interest rates, we should not have interpreted positive economic data earlier this year as being highly representative of the true run-rate of the US economy.  The same goes for the global economy, which has been the beneficiary of a lot of stimulus that is now fading, for a variety of economic and political reasons.\n\n \n\nGreat corporate profits are no guarantee against a problem in financial markets.  Corporate profits and P/E multiples were fine in June 2007, but rested on top of a systemic problem in private sector credit markets and private sector balance sheets.  This year, strong corporate profits and low P/E multiples sit on top of systemic problems in public sector finances.  \n\n \n\n[7] In the wreckage, as usual, there are opportunities, and we will be reviewing them with you in the days ahead.   There is a benefit to having held back on our firepower this year.  With risk to spend held in reserve, there are oversold assets with considering, particularly among multinationals with strong balance sheets, high dividends and which trade at very low multiples, something we reviewed earlier in the week.”\n\n \n\nMichael Cembalest\n\nChief Investment Officer\n\n \n\nThe material contained herein is intended as a general market commentary.

I kept running\ninto both of them, separately, at parties. Jeffrey is not a social animal so he usually has a couple of young women with\nhim who stand two feet behind him, as if serving a monarch. “Do they speak?” I remember asking him once, nodding\nat his lookalike blondes. He laughed. “Not like you,Vicky,” was his riposte.\n\nI remembered that when we'd once discussed math—in particular, an isosceles triangle—and I revealed I hadn’t\nstudied math since I was 14 (such is, or was, the way of the British educational system), I received a package at home\nvia messenger. It was a book: “Math for idiots.”\n\nSo he is not without humor, even though he doesn’t drink or smoke, and hates restaurants.\n\n“Jeffrey knows a good deal about most subjects,” newspaper publisher Mort Zuckerman told me last week. He was\ncertainly preaching to the converted. The truth is, Epstein does know a lot about a lot of things. Just a few moments\nin his company and you know this to be true.\n\nWhen I saw pictures of Prince Andrew walking in Central Park with Jeffrey, my immediate thought was that “Andy”\n—as Jeffrey calls him—is probably asking for help with his role as British trade envoy, or whatever his strange title is.\nBecause if one thing’s for sure: When it comes to international business, Jeffrey knows what he’s talking about far\nmore than “Andy” does. Which is why Leon Black, Mort Zuckerman and a few other financiers hang out with him.\n\nAnd Ghislaine?\nFull disclosure: I like her. Most people in New York do. It’s almost impossible not to.\n\nShe is always the most interesting, the most vivacious, the most unusual person in any room. I’ve spent hours talking\nto her about the third world at a bar until 2am. She is as passionate as she is knowledgeable. She is curious. She has\nspent weeks at the bottom of the ocean, literally going deeper than anyone else. She has sent me a DVD of the fish\nthere. Her rolodex would blow away almost anyone else’s I can think of—probably even Rupert Murdochs’. She is\nvery well-read and can talk about most things for hours. She is passionate about Bill Clinton with whom she is close\nfriends.\n\nYet, touchingly, when she had to give a speech at the 4oth birthday party of her best friend, Ariadne Calvo-Platero,\n(known fondly to her close friends as “the Tennis Goddess”) Ghislaine shook a little with nerves. When it comes\ndown to things she really cares about—and Ariadne is one of them—Ghislaine shows her vulnerability.\n\nAnd that vulnerability is key to understanding her friendship with Jeffrey.\n\n“He saved her,” Iremember a close friend of mine telling me. “When her father died, she was a wreck; inconsolable.\nAnd then Jeffrey took her in. She’s never forgotten that—and never will.”\n\nIn many ways, the socially awkward Epstein with his big house, plane, island and ranch was the perfect replacement\nfor her father, the late Robert Maxwell, newspaper tycoon and criminal. Sure, Jeffrey had his sexual pecadillos, but\nthen Ghislaine’s father was not without his oddities. After all, it was he who died leaving a massive “black hole” he’d\nfraudulently created. To Ghislaine, Jeffrey’s habits may not have seemed that strange.\n\nIn fact, she probably figured, rather like I have, after years of writing about he very rich, that most successful people\nin the end either have some weird habit (the late Bruce Wasserstein had the weight issues, the girl issues, and moved\ncountries to avoid paying tax), or they break the law (Sam Waksal, Martha Stewart.) You don’t tend to get to the top\nby being the world’s most balanced human being. Even the folksy Warren Buffett didn’t quite manage a normal life\n—whatever that is. He had a second “wife” for many years whose existence he has been open about.\n\nSo what to make of the current fuss over Ghislaine? I haven't spoken to her or to Jeffrey, but I suspect that her loyalty\n\nto friends like Bill Clinton will keep her in good stead, in the end, she'll be out and about as always. Look at Waksal\nand Stewart. No one sees them and thinks: criminal. Au contraire. In this city, money makes up for all sorts of\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_030585\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

Addresses and\ntelephone numbers of those offices may\nbe found on the Board’s Web site at\nhttp://www.nirb.gov. A copy of the\nposter in English and in languages other\nthan English may also be downloaded\nfrom the Board’s Web site at http://\nwww.nirb.gov. Employers also may\nreproduce and use copies of the Board’s\nofficial poster, provided that the copies\nduplicate the official poster in size,\ncontent, format, and size and style of\ntype. In addition, employers may use\ncommercial services to provide the\nemployee notice poster consolidated\nonto one poster with other Federally\nmandated labor and employment\nnotices, so long as the consolidation\ndoes not alter the size, content, format,\nor size and style of type of the poster\nprovided by the Board.\n\n(f) Electronic posting of employee\nnotice. (1) In addition to posting the\nrequired notice physically, an employer\nmust also post the required notice on an\nintranet or internet site if the employer\ncustomarily communicates with its\nemployees about personnel rules or\npolicies by such means. An employer\nthat customarily posts notices to\nemployees about personnel rules or\npolicies on an intranet or internet site\nwill satisfy the electronic posting\nrequirement by displaying\nprominently—i.e., no less prominently\nthan other notices to employees—on\nsuch a site either an exact copy of the\nposter, downloaded from the Board’s\nWeb site, or a link to the Board’s Web\nsite that contains the poster. The link to\nthe Board’s Web site must read,\n“Employee Rights under the National\nLabor Relations Act.”\n\n(2) Where 20 percent or more of an\nemployer’s workforce is not proficient\nin English and speaks a language other\nthan English, the employer must\nprovide notice as required in paragraph\n(f)(1) of this section in the language the\nemployees speak. If an employer's\nworkforce includes two or more groups\nconstituting at least 20 percent of the\nworkforce who speak different\nlanguages, the employer must provide\nthe notice in each such language. The\nBoard will provide translations of the\nlink to the Board’s Web site for any\nemployer that must or wishes to display\nthe link on its Web site. If an employer\nrequests from the Board a notice in a\nlanguage in which it is not available, the\nrequesting employer will not be liable\nfor non-compliance with the rule until\nthe notice becomes available in that\nlanguage.\n\n§ 104.203 Are Federal contractors covered\nunder this part?\n\nYes, Federal contractors are covered.\nHowever, contractors may comply with\nthe provisions of this part by posting the\nnotices to employees required under the\nDepartment of Labor’s notice-posting\nrule, 29 CFR part 471.\n\n§ 104.204 What entities are not subject to\nthis part?\n\n(a) The following entities are\nexcluded from the definition of\n“employer” under the National Labor\nRelations Act and are not subject to the\nrequirements of this part:\n\nTABLE TO § 104.204\n\n(1) The United States or any wholly\nowned Government corporation;\n\n(2) Any Federal Reserve Bank;\n\n(3) Any State or political subdivision\nthereof;\n\n(4) Any person subject to the Railway\nLabor Act;\n\n(5) Any labor organization (other than\nwhen acting as an employer); or\n\n(6) Anyone acting in the capacity of\nofficer or agent of such labor\norganization.\n\n(b) In addition, employers employing\nexclusively workers who are excluded\nfrom the definition of ‘“‘employee”’\nunder § 104.201 are not covered by the\nrequirements of this part.\n\n(c) This part does not apply to entities\nover which the Board has been found\nnot to have jurisdiction, or over which\nthe Board has chosen through regulation\nor adjudication not to assert\njurisdiction.\n\n(d)(1) This part does not apply to\nentities whose impact on interstate\ncommerce, although more than de\nminimis, is so slight that they do not\nmeet the Board’s discretionary\njurisdiction standards. The most\ncommonly applicable standards are:\n\n(i) The retail standard, which applies\nto employers in retail businesses,\nincluding home construction. The Board\nwill take jurisdiction over any such\nemployer that has a gross annual\nvolume of business of $500,000 or more.\n\n(ii) The nonretail standard, which\napplies to most other employers. It is\nbased either on the amount of goods\nsold or services provided by the\nemployer out of state (called ‘“‘outflow’’)\nor goods or services purchased by the\nemployer from out of state (called\n“inflow’’). The Board will take\njurisdiction over any employer with an\nannual inflow or outflow of at least\n$50,000. Outflow can be either direct—\nto out-of-state purchasers—or indirect—\nto purchasers that meet other\njurisdictional standards. Inflow can also\nbe direct—purchased directly from out\nof state—or indirect—purchased from\nsellers within the state that purchased\nthem from out-of-state sellers.\n\n(2) There are other standards for\nmiscellaneous categories of employers.\nThese standards are based on the\nemployer’s gross annual volume of\nbusiness unless stated otherwise. These\nstandards are listed in the Table to this\nsection.\n\nEmployer category\n\nJurisdictional standard\n\nAmusement industry\nApartment houses, condominiums, cooperatives\nArchitects\n\n$500,000.\n$500,000.\nNonretail standard.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_022318\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

In rare cases—because one\nusually excludes the other—US think tanks end up accepting funds from both Taiwan\nand mainland China sources.\n\nVisa Access\n\nMost American scholars consider travel to China an important element of their ability\nto do their job—attending conferences, participating in delegations, and undertaking\nindependent research. Given this imperative, the issue of visa access is a central one.\nWhile most analysts receive single-entry professional exchange (F) visas, a few\nroutinely receive one-year multiple-entry F visas, while some have ten-year tourist (L)\nvisas. Others receive double-entry visas, if proof of specific invitations are produced.\nOne US think-tank scholar, a Chinese national, travels to China on a Chinese passport.\nWhile ten-year multiple-entry tourist visas are, of course, optimal—there is also a serious\npotential downside: namely, that they are for “tourism,” and, according to Chinese\nlaw, professional activities are not permitted. One senior scholar who holds a ten-year\ntourist visa was recently visited and interrogated at his hotel in Beijing after several\ndays of meetings with Chinese think tanks and universities.\n\nSeveral think-tank analysts expressed the opinion that Chinese officials are now paying\nmore attention to the writings of American think-tank analysts—not only books,\narticles, and op-eds, but also social media. This is done not only to become familiar\nwith changing views but to catalog who is supportive and who is critical of China’s\npolicies. One scholar believes that, as a result of a comment posted on Twitter, this\nindividual was required to go to the Chinese embassy for an interview before being\ngranted a visa. This had never happened in his previous decades of China-related travel.\nIn another instance, Beijing attempted to enforce its sovereignty claims through the\nvisa process, A visa was initially denied because an American scholar had stated that\n“Hong Kong” and “Taiwan” were places he had previously visited, instead of “Hong\nKong SAR,” and “Taiwan, China.” Most of the scholars interviewed believe that the\nprocess of gaining a visa has become much more politicized and difficult in the past\nyear or two, with much more scrutiny given to an applicant’s political views. Among\nthose interviewed, only one think-tank scholar reported actually being denied a visa.\n(However, there have been reports of other think-tank analysts being rejected who\n\nare reluctant to go public about their denials.) In addition, most of those interviewed\nobserved that the Chinese embassy now often issues visas the day before or even the\nmorning of departure, making the visa process laborious and nerve-racking.\n\nTwo interviewees reported that companies that specialize in expediting visa\napplications have indicated that their respective think tanks are on a blacklist that\nmakes obtaining visas problematic.

However, though nobody can predict if or when a Singularity will occur\nafter unrestricted launch, only a truly irresponsible AGI development team would attempt to\ncreate an AGI without first experimenting with ethical training of the system in an intelligence-\ncapped form, by means of ethical instruction via human-AGI interaction both pedagogically\nand experientially.\n\n12.9.4 Global Brain Mindplex Scenarios\n\nAnother class of scenarios — overlapping some of the previous ones — involves the emergence\nof a “Global Brain,” an emergent intelligence formed from global communication networks in-\ncorporating humans and software programs in a larger body of self-organizing dynamics. The\nnotion of the Global Brain is reviewed in [Hey07, Tur77] and its connection with advanced\nAI is discussed in detail in Goertzel’s book Creating Internet Intelligence [Goe01], where three\npossible phases of “Global Brain” development are articulated:\n\ne Phase 1: computer and communication technologies as enhancers of human\ninteractions. This is what we have today: science and culture progress in ways that would\nnot be possible if not for the “digital nervous system” we’re spreading across the planet.\nThe network of idea and feeling sharing can become much richer and more productive than\nit is today, just through incremental development, without any Metasystem transition.\n\ne Phase 2: the intelligent Internet. At this point our computer and communication sys-\ntems, through some combination of self-organizing evolution and human engineering, have\nbecome a coherent mind on their own, or a set of coherent minds living in their own digital\nenvironment.\n\ne Phase 3: the full-on Singularity. A complete revision of the nature of intelligence, human\nand otherwise, via technological and intellectual advancement totally beyond the scope of\nour current comprehension. At this point our current psychological and cultural realities\nare no more relevant than the psyche of a goose is to modern society.\n\nThe main concern of Creating Internet Intelligence is with\n\ne how to get from Phase 1 to Phase 2 - i.e. how to build an AGI system that will effect or\nencourage the transformation of the Internet into a coherent intelligent system\n\ne how to ensure that the Phase 2, Internet-savvy, global-brain-centric AGI systems will be\noriented toward intelligence-improving self-modification (so they’ll propel themselves to\nPhase 3), and also toward generally positive goals (as opposed to, say, world domination\nand extermination of all other intelligent life forms besides themselves!)\n\nOne possibly useful concept in this context is that of a mindplex: an intelligence that is\ncomposed largely of individual intelligences with their own self-models and global workspaces,\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_013153\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

Would you consider being part of those movements?\n\nRB: My only fear about those movements would be if they didn't exist! My neighbor\ndown the hall for the past 25 years built my dungeon and was a co-founder of Gay Male\nSM Activists, but I always had too much hot sex going on at home to be interested in\nmeetings. Plus, I never stopped feeling like a pariah in the gay community because of the\nattacks on me and my writing since AIDS began. You reach a point where you just\nassume people hate you because it's easier than trying to figure out who doesn't.\n\nI fiercely support BDSM advocacy, but mainly from a distance. There's a limited number\nof body blows any activist can take before we just retreat. I had my fill -- but the response\nto Sex Positive and the new Obama era is nudging me out of my shell. I had a breakup a\nfew years ago that devastated me, so I've been out of the scene for almost three years.\nNow I'm trying to reinvent myself, find one person I can retreat from the world with. I've\nnever lied about S&M being an intrinsic part of my sexuality, and because of my early\nbad experiences with BDSM, I'm thrilled and inspired by advocates for it. If there had\nbeen BDSM advocacy when I came into BDSM, then I don't think I would have had the\nbad experiences I mentioned earlier. As a BDSM sex worker, I met so many men who\nhad horrible tales of being hurt in scenes, and I did my best to be an antidote for that.\n\nCT: On my blog, you commented that \"Of course BDSM was a source of joy in my\nlife but I put it aside when it robs me from having a platform to champion safe sex\nto the largest possible audience, which BDSM often has.\" Could you talk more\nabout that?\n\nRB: Smear campaigns are hard to pin down, and there's no way to know how much of the\ncontempt against me or my writing was due to my BDSM, my sex work, my safe sex\nevangelism or simply me. I'm just a dangling pinata for people who have issues with sex!\n\nThere are gay people of my generation who are as uninformed and rabidly anti-BDSM\nsex as homophobes are about gay sex.\n\nI can't think of anyone who has gone on film with such brutally honest testimony about\ntheir radical sexual history as I did in Sex Positive. It felt like a huge risk and you can see\nmy anxiety in the film, but to me, this level of honesty is crucial to pro-sex activism.\nPeople are so dishonest about sex; many would never talk publicly about their private\nsexual behavior -- and they don't want others doing it either, so it's not easy.\n\nThere was a doctor I saw once when AIDS began who heard I was into S&M. As he went\nto take blood from me, he stabbed the needle into my arm. I bolted out of the chair\nscreaming, and he said coyly, \"Oh, sorry, I thought you liked pain.\" How can I not feel\nreticent talking about BDSM considering so many people I've met like that? And then I\nthink, how can I not?\n\nI've seen the most courageous pro-sex writers and activists attacked, pilloried and\nsilenced because of their honesty in writing about their kinky sexual histories. I shudder\nwhen I recall the vicious smears against pro-sex feminists by anti-porn feminists back in\nthe early 80s. I don't want to invite that bile into my life, especially now, when my circle\nof gay male friends are no longer alive and here to support me when I go out on a limb\nwith my personal radical sexual issues in public.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_018566\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

Central to the future of these developments is physicist David\nDeutsch, the founder of the field of quantum computation, whose 1985 paper on\nuniversal quantum computers was the first full treatment of the subject; the Deutsch-\nJozsa algorithm was the first quantum algorithm to demonstrate the enormous potential\npower of quantum computation.\n\nWhen he initially proposed it, quantum computation seemed practically\nimpossible. But the explosion in the construction of simple quantum computers and\nquantum communication systems never would have taken place without his work. He has\nmade many other important contributions in areas such as quantum cryptography and\nthe many-worlds interpretation of quantum theory. In a philosophic paper (with Artur\nEkert), he appealed to the existence of a distinctive quantum theory of computation to\nargue that our knowledge of mathematics is derived from, and subordinate to, our\nknowledge of physics (even though mathematical truth is independent of physics).\n\nBecause he has spent a good part of his working life changing people's\nworldviews, his recognition among his peers as an intellectual goes well beyond his\nscientific achievement. He argues (following Karl Popper) that scientific theories are\n“bold conjectures, ” not derived from evidence but only tested by it. His two main lines of\nresearch at the moment—qubit-field theory and constructor theory—may well yield\nimportant extensions of the computational idea.\n\nIn the following essay, he more or less aligns himself with those who see human-\nlevel artificial intelligence as promising us a better world rather than the Apocalypse. In\nfact, he pleads for AGI to be, in effect, given its head, free to conjecture—a proposition\nthat several other contributors to this book would consider dangerous.\n\n84\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_016304\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

I played a consulting role in\nthe defense of Dr. Spock and eventually wrote an article for the New York Times about the case\nafter the convictions were reversed on appeal.\n\nThe most publicized and notorious of the Vietnam protest cases was the conspiracy prosecution\nagainst the “Chicago 7” growing out of demonstrations during the 1968 Democratic Convention.\nAfter the trial of that case, the lead defense lawyer—William Kunstler—was held in contempt of\ncourt and sentenced to four years imprisonment. I was part of the legal team assembled to\nprepare the appeal of that contempt order. We won.\n\nAnother major prosecution was against the Berrigan brothers and other radical leaders of the draft\nresistance movement. I was asked to work on the defense of that case, but was “fired” by one of\nthe more militant defendants when he learned that I was a Zionist.\n\nThe bitterness of the Vietnam War spread rapidly over college and university campuses. What\nbegan as peaceful teach-ins and protests soon turned to confrontations and violence. In 1969,\nthere was an anti-war protest at Harvard that led to violence and several years of continuous\nturmoil on that venerable campus. These events led the university to attempt to suspend or\ndismiss numerous students. I represented several of these students against the university. One\nwas accused of “giving the finger” to a speaker. Another was accused of shouting “no silence in\nthe face of death,” when the speaker requested a moment of silence for soldiers killed in combat.\nWe won both cases.\n\nAt Stanford University the leader of the antiwar group was a professor of English literature\nnamed Bruce Franklin. He was a Maoist, a Stalinist, and an advocate and practitioner of direct\naction, including violence. As a result of several speeches he gave and activities in which he\nparticipated, the Stanford administration decided to strip him of tenure and fire him. It was the\nfirst political firmg of a tenured professor by a major university since the terrible days of\nMcCarthyism. I took his case on behalf of the American Civil Liberties Union.\n\nAs the war was winding down and the United States was deciding to withdraw from Vietnam, the\nCIA was given a major role in overseeing the American evacuation. One of the highest ranking\nCIA agents in charge of the operation was Frank Snepp. Snepp wrote an uncensored account of\nhis experiences—taking care, however, not to disclose any classified material. He refused to\nsubmit his manuscript for prior “approval” by the CIA, as required in his employment contract.\nWhen his book entitled Decent Interval was published the CIA sued him, and the case eventually\n\n“!

By the Turing Test? Unfortunately, that requires\na thinking judge. One might imagine a vast collaborative project on the Internet, where\nan AI hones its thinking abilities in conversations with human judges and becomes an\nAGI. But that assumes, among other things, that the longer the judge is unsure whether\nthe program is a person, the closer it is to being a person. There is no reason to expect\nthat.\n\nAnd how does one test for disobedience? Imagine Disobedience as a compulsory\nschool subject, with daily disobedience lessons and a disobedience test at the end of term.\n(Presumably with extra credit for not turning up for any of that.) This is paradoxical.\n\nSo, despite its usefulness in other applications, the programming technique of\ndefining a testable objective and training the program to meet it will have to be dropped.\nIndeed, I expect that any testing in the process of creating an AGI risks being\ncounterproductive, even immoral, just as in the education of humans. I share Turing’s\nsupposition that we’ll know an AGI when we see one, but this partial ability to recognize\nsuccess won’t help in creating the successful program.\n\nIn the broadest sense, a person’s quest for understanding is indeed a search\nproblem, in an abstract space of ideas far too large to be searched exhaustively. But there\nis no predetermined objective of this search. There is, as Popper put it, no criterion of\ntruth, nor of probable truth, especially in regard to explanatory knowledge. Objectives\nare ideas like any others—created as part of the search and continually modified and\nimproved. So inventing ways of disabling the program’s access to most of the space of\nideas won’t help—whether that disability is inflicted with the thumbscrew and stake or a\nmental straitjacket. To an AGI, the whole space of ideas must be open. It should not be\nknowable in advance what ideas the program can never contemplate. And the ideas that\nthe program does contemplate must be chosen by the program itself, using methods,\ncriteria, and objectives that are also the program’s own. Its choices, like an AI’s, will be\nhard to predict without running it (we lose no generality by assuming that the program is\ndeterministic; an AGI using a random generator would remain an AGI if the generator\nwere replaced by a pseudo-random one), but it will have the additional property that there\nis no way of proving, from its initial state, what it won ’t eventually think, short of\nrunning it.\n\nThe evolution of our ancestors is the only known case of thought starting up\nanywhere in the universe. As I have described, something went horribly wrong, and\nthere was no immediate explosion of innovation: Creativity was diverted into something\nelse. Yet not into transforming the planet into paper clips (pace Nick Bostrom). Rather,\nas we should also expect if an AGI project gets that far and fails, perverted creativity was\nunable to solve unexpected problems. This caused stasis and worse, thus tragically\ndelaying the transformation of anything into anything. But the Enlightenment has\nhappened since then. We know better now.\n\n90\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_016310\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

I think she probably considered me a bit\nnaive. Anyway, Lena watched the situation and my body language; she knew that it was\nmy first time smoking. A few minutes later, she took me aside. I don't remember the\nexact conversation, but I seem to recall that it went something like this:\n\n\"Clarisse,” Lena said, \"how are you feeling?”\n\"I'm not sure,\" I said. Truth be told, I felt a bit numb.\nLena looked directly into my face. \"How far do you want to go tonight?\" she asked.\n\nI looked away. I felt embarrassed because she seemed so composed. I felt like an airhead\ncompared to her. We were standing next to a wooden wall, and I pretended to study the\nwood-grain. \"I don't know,\" I said vaguely.\n\n\"If you can tell me how far you want to go tonight,\" Lena said firmly, \"then I'll make sure\nnothing goes past that. Do you want to keep making out? Do you want to do more than\nmake out?\"\n\nI traced a knot in the wood with my finger. \"Making out,\" I decided.\n\n\"Okay,\" Lena said, and nodded. I don't remember if she said anything else, but as she\ntook me back to the group I still felt a little embarrassed -- and also incredibly relieved.\n\nI wonder if I ever thanked Lena? I should have; maybe I'll try to find her on Facebook or\nsomething. Because I really did feel a lot safer that night, knowing that Lena was looking\nout for me. I made out with that gentleman a little bit more, but after a while I put a stop\nto it, and nothing else happened.\n\nMaybe if Lena hadn't been there, I still would have had the wherewithal to stop making\nout with him; or maybe I would have felt so confused, anxious, numb that I let it go\nfurther. (And I can tell you for sure that I'm glad it didn't go further.) Or, God forbid,\nmaybe if she hadn't been there then I would have been actively pressured into something\nthat I actively objected to.\n\nBefore that, it had never occurred to me to set a clear boundary before I hooked up with a\nguy. That's an important lesson in itself! Even more importantly, though, Lena didn't tell\n\nme what to do. She didn't say anything about how I should be sexual, or who I should do\n\nit with. She didn't shame me for what was up. She just asked me what I wanted, and then\n\nshe offered me her support.\n\nCertainly, Lena is just one small piece in the puzzle of my life. But I still remember her,\nand I admire and thank her. My parents have offered me a lot of support throughout my\nlife, both in my relationships and otherwise. I've had partners who helped show me what\nit means to create a low-pressure sexual environment, or who helped me learn clear\nsexual communication. Still, Lena stands out in my mind -- someone I barely knew, yet\nsomeone who helped show me what it means to be among women who stand up for each\nother and help preserve each other's boundaries.\n\nte OK ok\n\nThis can be found on the Internet at:\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_018572\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

Analogously to language learning, an AGI system may receive ethical training from a wide\nvariety of humans in parallel, e.g. via controlling characters in wide-access virtual worlds,\nand gaining feedback and guidance regarding the ethics of the behaviors demonstrated by\nthese characters\n\n2. Internet-based information systems may be used to explicitly gather information regarding\nhuman values and goals, which may then be appropriately utilized as input for an AGI\nsystem’s top-level goals\n\nThe second point begins to make abstract-sounding notions like Coherent Extrapolated Volition\nand Coherent Aggregated Volition, mentioned above, seem more practical and concrete. It’s\ninteresting to think about gathering information about individuals’ values via brain imaging,\nonce that technology exists; but at present, one could make a fair stab at such a task via\nmuch more prosaic methods, such as asking people questions, assessing their ethical reactions\nto various real-world and hypothetical scenarios, and possibly engaging them in structured\ninteractions aimed specifically at eliciting collectively acceptable value systems (the subject of\nthe next item on our list). It seems to us that this sort of approach could realize CAV in an\ninteresting way, and also encapsulate some of the ideas underlying CAV.\n\nThere is an interesting resonance here with recent thinking in the area of open source\ngovernance [Wik11]. Similar software tools (and associated psychocultural patterns) to those\nbeing developed to help with open source development and choice of political policies (see\nhttp://metagovernment.org) may be useful for gathering value data aimed at shaping\nAGI goal system content.\n\n12.7.1 The Importance of Fostering Deep, Consensus- Building\nInteractions Between People with Divergent Views\n\nTwo potentially problematic issues arising with the notion of using Global Brain related tech-\nnologies to form a \"coherent volition\" from the divergent views of various human beings are:\n\ne the tendency of the Internet to encourage people to interact mainly with others who share\ntheir own narrow views and interests, rather than a more diverse body of people with widely\ndivergent views. The 300 people in the world who want to communicate using predicate\nlogic (see http: //lojban.org) can find each other, and obscure musical virtuosos from\naround the world can find an audience, and researchers in obscure domains can share papers\nwithout needing to wait years for paper journal publication, etc.\n\ne the tendency of many contemporary Internet technologies to reduce interaction to a very\nsimplistic level (e.g. 140 character tweets, brief Facebook wall posts), the tendency of in-\nformation overload to cause careful reading to be replaced by quick skimming, and other\nrelated trends, which mean that deep sharing of perspectives by individuals with widely\ndivergent views is not necessarily encouraged. As a somewhat extreme example, many of\nthe YouTube pages displaying rock music videos are currently littered with comments by\n\"haters\" asserting that rock music is inferior to classical or jazz or whatever their prefer-\nence is — obviously this is a far cry from deep and productive sharing between people with\ndifferent tastes and backgrounds.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_013147\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

One is the deliberate effort to manage\nUS perceptions and to frame issues in ways that are favorable to the Chinese\nCommunist Party. As one analyst noted, “This requires pushback, which is tough work.”\nWhile many believed that they could adequately defend themselves against efforts to\ninfluence them, noting as one did that the “the general capacity of US society to push\nback is not bad,” they worried about their colleagues who were not knowledgeable\nChina experts and might therefore be more easily deceived. For example, one scholar\npointed out that with US-China cooperation, the incentive is to come up with shared\nvalues and ideas. He noted that in the case of the Sanya Initiative (the US-China\ndialogue featuring retired military officers from both sides), he has had to “talk them\n(the American participants) off the ledge; they think they are being tough, but they\nare mistaken.” This same analyst sees the American media as complicit in echoing\nChinese perspectives, noting that when Xi Jinping delivered his speech in Davos in\nJanuary 2017, few reporters understood that the Chinese were in the midst of a major\npropaganda campaign to promote globalization 2.0. He also suggests that there is “de\nfacto self-censorship” of entire areas of scholarship: human rights for one. Another\nanalyst noted that outside of the National Endowment for Democracy, she does not see\nmuch foundation interest in normal discourse in this issue either.\n\nOne scholar worried about growing Chinese control over all areas of US-Chinese\ninteraction: “The Chinese are following people, bugging our hotel rooms. There is\nimbalanced control that serves CCP interests not ours. There is lack of serious training\nby the US side on how to deal with Chinese influence.” The potential for Chinese\nmoney to give China leverage over American think tanks also provoked a degree of\nanxiety. Several scholars expressed concern over funding issues, noting that reliance\non a single funder with an agenda makes scholars vulnerable. In addition, one scholar\nworried that the amount of money China is spending to promote its views, whether\nthrough think-tank cooperation or the Chinese media (such as CGTN paying for its\ninterviews) means that China will ultimately be able to “buy its way in.”\n\nA number of analysts believed that the involvement of the US government in these\nissues will only make things more contentious. There is concern that Washington will\noverreact. As one analyst noted, there is a type of “binaryism in Washington, in which\nyou must be ‘for or against’ China; you are either friendly to China or producing stuff\nthat says China is evil.” This scholar, along with several others, raised the issue of\n\nthe rise of anti-China sentiments, such as the “yellow peril” and McCarthyism, and\nexpressed concern about Chinese Americans and anyone who has interests with China\ncoming under attack. One analyst mentioned the Committee of 100, a collection of\nprominent Chinese Americans, as being particularly vulnerable to unfair attack.\n\nThink Tanks\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_020533\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

Mine sees a population arranged in local “demes” which intrabreed in most\ncases for best adaptation to local pressures including pathogens and parasites. A\nlocal strain to which the local deme is adapted might spread to other demes which\nare not. Hosts in the invaded demes become sick. Female ones there intuit the\ndegraded conditions, breed less often, and breed mostly females (mothers can\nchoose) because males with their now ill-adapted anti-parasite (histocampatability)\ngenes will find few willing mates. This begins the part from Trivers. I'll come to\n\nAlexander’s later.\n\nMothers in the source deme see an opposite picture. Conditions are not necessarily\nbetter than before, but they are better than in the invaded demes. They intuit this,\nbreed more often, and breed mostly males. The males migrate to those invaded\ndemes, carrying histocompatibility genes pre-adapted to the invaders, and find\nwilling mates there if they can show the signs. The idea that mothers choose to\nbreed mostly males in prosperous conditions is the other half of Trivers’ idea. The\nidea that the invading parasite and the males with antidote genes might tend to\n\noriginate from the same deme may be mine.\n\nThat presupposes that females can trust the signs. Nature makes sure they can. She\nprovides resistant males with hard-to-feign ones to prove it. This was one of\nHamilton’s key insights. His idea has been called the “truth in advertising” theory.\nSymmetrical antlers, deep croaks, accurate songs and bright colors where they\nshould be tell the females whose genes can be trusted. Parasites and pathogens\n\nwould fake them in afflicted host males if they could. It seems they can’t.\n\nHamilton, I believe, had solved three nagging puzzles at once.

She later recalled in interviews that\nhe was “a bit” prone to brooding and voiced growing dissatisfaction with the CIA.\n\nDuring his time in Geneva, he received no promotions or commendations for his work. In\nDecember 2008, he received an unfavorable evaluation from his superior and a “derog,” the\nCIA’s shorthand for a derogatory comment. He was also threatened with a punitive investigation\nunless he agreed to quietly resign from the CIA. “It was not a stellar career,” Tyler Drumheller,\nformer CIA station chief told me in 2014.\n\nThe job in Geneva did have its benefits, however. It provided him a generous housing and\ntravel allowance. In many ways, it was the “cushy government job” he had said he was seeking in\nhis Internet posts. He rented a four room apartment and had his girlfriend Lindsay Mills, now 21,\njoin him there.\n\nAccording to his posts on the Ars Technica web site, he took full advantage of his\ncompensation to live the high life. He gambled on financial developments in the option markets,\nlosing and making substantial sums of money. He also bought a BMW sports car. While these\nBMW had a speed control to keep the car within the speed limit, he wrote that he illicitly disabled\nit so he could exceed this legal limit. He described in his posts other pursuits, including racing\nmotorcycles it Italy and traveling around Germany with an Estonian rock star (who he did not\nfurther identify.) He also continued his fantasy life in Internet gaming. The gaming alias he\nchose was “Wolfking Awesomefox.” He even indulged in a fantasy gun sport called Airsoft, a\nvariation of paint ball, in which participants used realistic looking pistols to splatter each other\nwith paint.\n\nHis good fortune came to an abrupt end in 2008. He suffered a massive loss in his options\nspeculations. He wrote in a post that he had \"lost $20,000 in October [2008] alone;” a sum which\nrepresented a substantial part of the $66,000 a year CIA salary. He blamed the US financial\nsystem, posting on Ars Technica that Ben Bernanke, the Federal Reserve chairman, was a\n“cockbag.” He also bet against any further rise in the stock market index, asking a user with\nwhom he was chatting on the Ars Technica site in December 2008 to “pray” for a collapse of\nstock prices. When his correspondent asked him why he wanted him to pray for a decline,\nSnowden responded “because then I’Il be filthy fucking rich.” The stock market, however,\ncontinued to rise, and Snowden also lost this bet.\n\nSnowden lashed out at others on the Internet over these setbacks. He termed those who\nquestioned his financial judgment as “fucking retards.” As with other setbacks, he blamed them\non government officials. He even advertised them in Ars Technica, a closely-watched Internet\nforum, while serving in the CIA.

He said “all\nissues of occupation” were on the table — the West Bank and Gaza, the Golan\nHeights, and Lebanon — and vowed to “let our fire eat half of Israel” in a future\nwar. And we could not assume this was mere rhetoric. Iraq had an arsenal of\nSoviet-made ballistic missiles. Called Scuds, they were not always accurate at\nlong range. But they could reach Israeli towns and cities, and could carry not\njust conventional explosives but chemical warheads. Moreover, Saddam had\nused chemical weapons: during the Iran-Iraq war, and to kill thousands of his\nown restive Kurdish population in the town of Halabja in the spring of 1988.\n\nEven the prospect of American military action seemed not to faze him.\nHours into the invasion, he moved an armored force toward Kuwait’s border\nwith Saudi Arabia, a key US regional ally, immediately prompting the President\nGeorge Bush’s administration to go beyond mere verbal condemnation. With\nSaudi agreement, Washington dispatched a squadron of F-15s to the kingdom —\nthe first step in what would become a huge American land, sea and air force to\nface down Saddam and force him out of Kuwait.\n\nGiven the credible threat of Scud missile attacks on Israel, Dan immediately\nassigned me to coordinate our assessment and evaluation of what Saddam was\nlikely to do in the event of a US-led attack, and what defense arrangements or\nIsraeli military response would be necessary. We knew we’d be under strong\npressure from the Americans to stay out of any war.

Then, after months of elaborate negotiations, the state prosecutors believed\nthey had reached a reasoned resolution of the matter that vindicated the public interest -- a resolution entirely\nconsistent with that of cases involving other similarly-situated defendants.\n\nThen, in came the feds. The United States Attorney's Office tried, to no avail, to fit Mr. Epstein's situation into\nits vision of what it viewed as a commercial trafficking ring targeting minors. This was anything but. At long\nlast, the federal authorities acknowledged that stark reality and grudgingly agreed to defer prosecution to the\nstate. But there was a huge catch. In the face of our arguments sharply condemning their overreach, the\nfederal prosecutors insisted on many unorthodox requirements that tugged at fundamental values of due\nprocess. For example, the agreement required Mr. Epstein to pay an undisclosed list of asserted victims\n$150,000 each. Even more, the feds insisted that Jeffrey pay for an attorney to represent such unidentified\nvictims if any chose to filed civil litigation against him. When asked what possible legal authority supported\nthis extravagant exercise of national power, the feds lamely cited a wildly inapposite case from Alaska\ninvolving cocaine and forced on-the-street prostitution. Apples and oranges.\n\nUnder the federally-forced deal, Jeffrey was sentenced to jail. That would not have been the case under the\nagreed-upon state disposition of this non-violent, consensual commercial arrangement. Jeffrey complied,\nserved that sentence, and in the process was treated exactly the same as other state-incarcerated\n\nindividuals. His conduct was exemplary, and so characterized by the state custodial authorities. He continued\nhis work, including his many philanthropic efforts.\n\nOur friend Jeffrey Epstein has paid his debt to society. He has also paid out millions of dollars to the asserted\nvictims and their highly-creative lawyers. For over ten years, he has lived an exemplary life, including\ncarrying on his wide-ranging philanthropies. Those of us who represented him in the Florida proceedings -- for\ncustomary professional fees -- now count him as a trusted friend.\n\nOur nation faces vitally important challenges, many involving the treatment of women and basic human\ndignity. Voices are rightly being raised speaking truth to power, especially about women in the\n\nworkplace. But Jeffrey, an exemplary employer, has long since been called to account by the criminal justice\nsystem for his misdeeds of yesteryear. In the spirit of the bedrock American belief in second chances, that\nunhappy chapter in Jeffrey's otherwise-magnificent life should be allowed to close once and for all.\n\nOn Thu, Dec 13, 2018 at 4:24 PM J <jeevacation@gmail.com> wrote:\nken ,would take a stab at the article for the law journal. ? thx\n\nplease note\nThe information contained in this communication is\nconfidential, may be attorney-client privileged, may\nconstitute inside information, and is intended only for\nthe use of the addressee.

To begin, the privileges\nand immunities accorded by the IOIA are only default\nrules. If the work of a given international organization\nwould be impaired by restrictive immunity, the organiza-\ntion’s charter can always specify a different level of im-\nmunity. The charters of many international organizations\ndo just that. See, e.g., Convention on Privileges and Im-\nmunities of the United Nations, Art. IT, §2, Feb. 18, 1946,\n21 U.S. T. 1422, T. I. A. S. No. 6900 (The United Nations\n... shall enjoy immunity from every form of legal process\nexcept insofar as in any particular case it has expressly\nwaived its immunity’); Articles of Agreement of the Inter-\nnational Monetary Fund, Art. IX, §8, Dec. 27, 1945, 60\nStat. 1418, T. I. A. S. No. 1501 (MF enjoys “immunity\nfrom every form of judicial process except to the extent\nthat it expressly waives its immunity’). Notably, the\nIFC’s own charter does not state that the IFC is absolutely\nimmune from suit.\n\nNor is there good reason to think that restrictive im-\nmunity would expose international development banks to\nexcessive liability. As an initial matter, it is not clear that\nthe lending activity of all development banks qualifies as\ncommercial activity within the meaning of the FSIA. To\nbe considered “commercial,” an activity must be “the type”\nof activity “by which a private party engages in” trade or\ncommerce. Republic of Argentina v. Weltover, Inc., 504\nU.S. 607, 614 (1992); see 28 U.S.C. §1603(d). As the\nGovernment suggested at oral argument, the lending\nactivity of at least some development banks, such as those\nthat make conditional loans to governments, may not\nqualify as “commercial” under the FSIA.

If the FBI sincerely believed Trump associates\nwere Russian targets or agents, the proper response would have been to inform Mr. Trump so that he\n\ncould protect his campaign and the country.\n\nMr. Trump’s critics argue that the claim of political bias is belied by the fact that Crossfire was not\nleaked before the election. In fact, there were vigorous, successful pre-election efforts to publicize the\nTrump-Russia collusion narrative. Shortly after Crossfire’s launch, CIA Director John Brennan and Mr.\nComey briefed Congress, triggering predictable leaking.

On the morning of May 24,\n1992, a 15-year-old Israeli schoolgirl named Helena Rapp was on her way to\ncatch the bus to school south of Tel Aviv, when another Gazan stabbed her to\ndeath. To the extent Israelis were looking for someone to blame, there were\nobvious candidates. The army, the primary defense against the intifada, was\none. The police even more so, since many of the attacks were now taking place\ninside Israel. And in ugly rioting after Helena Rapp’s murder, bands of Israelis\ntook to the streets, some of them yelling: “Death to the Arabs’. Still, most\npeople understood that criticizing the army or the police, or going on a rampage\nagainst “the Arabs” — hundreds of thousands of whom were Israeli citizens and\nhad lived among us since the birth of the state — would not help. Most, in fact,\nplaced the blame, and lodged their hopes, with the government.\n\nBy the time of the next election, in June 1992, the combination of Palestinian\nviolence and the still-traumatic memories of Saddam’s Scuds, left Israelis\ndoubtful that Shamir could fulfil the most basic responsibility of government:\nensuring their day-to-day security. Labor had once again placed its electoral\nfortunes in the hands of Yitzhak Rabin, following Peres’s several failed\nattempts to lead the party back into power. Knowing that Rabin had a record of\nmilitary command unmatched in Israeli politics, Labor strategists did not so\nmuch need to convince voters as to reinforce their fears and frustrations. One of\nthe campaign slogans, a direct appeal to the anger over the stabbing of Helena\nRapp, was “Get Gaza out of Tel Aviv!” Labor ended up gaining five Knesset\nseats, and now had 44. The Likud lost eight and was left with only 32.\n\nThat meant that my last three years as chief of staff would be with Rabin\nback as Prime Minister — and, like Ben-Gurion before him, as Defense Minister\nas well. He and I had been in touch only occasionally since his departure from\nthe unity-coalition government two years earlier. But I had, of course, spoken\nwith him after my appointment as ramatkal, in which he’d played an important\npart. Though he was 20 years older than me, our relationship had become\nsteadily closer over the years, especially when I’d worked with him as Defense\nMinister. In some ways, we were alike. We’d both been forged by Labor\nZionism. We were career military officers, uncomfortable with flights of\npolitical rhetoric and convinced that Israel’s security and its future depended\nless on words than on action. In large groups especially, both of us tended to be\nmen of a few words. Over the next few years, we would become even closer,\nspeaking not only in the kirya or at Yitzhak’s office in Jerusalem, but also, with\nNava and Leah, around the dinner table at Rabin’s apartment in Tel Aviv.\n\n244\nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 011715\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

It is rare for a man of practical gifts\nto be a deep thinker too. Petty, like my father, was both. His Verbum Sapienti of 1664\nwas first to apply the ancient capitalization formula to both factors, meaning\nworkers as well as tradeable things, and so originated the concept of human capital\nas present value. He applied this insight there and his Political Arithmetick in 1676,\nand again in The Total Wealth of England in 1683, to measure the total wealth of\nEngland including human capital.

The utility or\nusus fructus being a given, we bid less for the land or other capital producing it if we\nare less patient, and more if more. Bidding less for this denominator of rate of return\nbids that rate itself up if the numerator is a given, and conversely. That’s why riskier\nassets offer higher return.

It intrigued him enough for him to bring it to\nthe attention of his superiors, as he later said. Snowden saw that a rogue system administrator like\nhimself could use his computer privileges to download and steal documents in ways that would go\nunnoticed. The emergence of a rogue system administrator was not that farfetched in 2009.\nHacktavists such as Julian Assange had adopted the battle cry: system administrators, or “syst\nadmins of the world unite.” Instead of asking them to “throw off their chains,” as Marx did, he\nasked them to send classified documents about secret government activity to the Wikileaks site.\nSnowden recalled in Moscow in 2014: “I actually recommended they [the NSA] move to two-\nman control for administrative access back in 2009.” To make his point even clearer, he added:\n“A whistleblower could use these things, but so could a spy.” Not without irony, Snowden\nhimself became that rogue system administrator some three years later at Dell. In fact, he later\nused the vulnerability he pointed out to steal NSA documents at Dell (before moving to Booz\nAllen.).\n\nIn September 2009, Snowden made a ten day trip to India. He later said he was on an official\nvisit “working at the US embassy.” He was still on the Dell payroll. Hotel records show that he\narrived at the Hyatt Regency hotel in New Delhi on September 2™ from Japan, and at 3:30 pm on\nSeptember 3\", checked into the Koenig Inn, a facility that was an annex to Koenig Solutions, a\nschool that gave crash courses on programming and computer hacking. According to Rohit\nAggarwal, the head of the school, Snowden stayed there until September 10\" while taking classes\nwith a private instructor. It cost $2,000 in tuition and fees, which Snowden prepaid from Japan\nwith his own personal credit card. Even though Snowden later said he only took courses in\n“programming,” the school’s records show that during that week he took intensive courses in\nsophisticated hacking techniques. Although the course was entitled “ethical hacking” that was\nalso a euphemism for teaching the techniques of illicit hacking. The course provided tutoring on\nhacker’s tools, such as “Spyeye” and “ZeuS,” that are used to circumvent security procedures. It\nalso demonstrated how these hacking tools could be customized by criminals and spies to break\ninto files, plant surveillance programs, impersonate system administrators, assume the privileges\nof system administrators in a network, and capture the passwords of others. On September 11\",\nSnowden, according to hotel records, left India for Japan. While the stated purpose of the\nhacking training was to allow security consultants to detect intruders, it also prepared Snowden\nto be, if he chooses to be, an intruder in the NSA system.\n\nOne problem with working as a contractor is that the standard two-year contracts are not\nnecessarily renewed, making a contractor’s job essentially temporary employment. Nor is there\nmuch possibility for advancement for IT workers. As one contractor told me “It is a dead end job\nwith great pay.” In the fall of 2010, Snowden’s contract in Japan with Dell SecureWorks came\nto anend. Dell then offered Snowden a new position in the United States.\n\nHe now was assigned to work at Dell headquarters in Annapolis, Maryland. He rented a modest\nsuburban house shaded by a Sakura cherry tree in suburb of Annapolis, Maryland.

He asserted in\nhis email that the “shock” of the documents he would give Greenwald would result in the public’s\nlearning about the secret “mechanisms through which our privacy is violated.” According to\nSnowden’s assessment, following that initial uproar, they could achieve another objective in their\ncommon cause. “We can guarantee for all people equal protection against unreasonable search,”\nhe wrote. In light of this convergence of views, it is not surprising that Greenwald was fully\nconvinced of Citizen 4’s bona fides. He said to Poitras, “He’s real,” and he agreed to help break\nthe story in the Guardian.\n\nAfter he said he was onboard the project, Poitras revealed to Greenwald that Citizen 4 would\ndeliver an entire trove of secret documents to them in six to eight weeks. According to this\ntimetable, the Greenwald’s scoop, and the “shock” Citizen 4 promised, would come in early to\nmid June 2013.\n\nAt this point in late April, Snowden was in full control.

When our\nmotorcade approached the generator, Rifa’at leaned out from the co-pilot’s\nwindow. He was pointing a pistol at us. He seemed to be in his late 20s or early\n30s. He had dark hair and a moustache and the hint of a stubbly beard. We\nstopped beside the generator. I got out and walked toward the cockpit, halting\nabout 10 feet away. Looking up the hijacker, I made a conscious effort to appear\ncurious rather than worried. His eyes seemed a mix of intense focus and tension.\nI opened the front of my overalls. Because of the heat, I was wearing nothing\nelse on top. He nodded his head to signal he was satisfied. I refastened the\noveralls and moved off. One by one, the other men passed inspection. Then we\nwent back and brought the two smaller ladders to the side of each wing, and the\n“mechanics” set down to work. I delayed bringing in the large ladders so as to\nminimize any risk of arousing the terrorists’ suspicions.\n\nThe fact that at least so far they seemed to suspect nothing was in large part\ndown to Dayan’s misdirection plan. As we began working on the plane, the\n“Palestinian” prisoners were disembarking from buses about 300 yards away.\nAs Rifa’at watched, several hundred men formed long rows. A few of them\nwaved in his direction.

All that remained\nwas for me to give a short, sharp whistle and the attack would begin. Yet just as\nI was raising my fingers to my mouth, I saw Bibi coming toward me from under\nthe fuselage. He motioned to me to wait. Zur, the last of our air marshals, had a\nproblem. Having spent 10 hours in the air on the way back to Israel, before\nbeing immediately plugged into an assault team, he had something to attend to.\n“He has to take a shit,” Bibi said. Can’t it wait, I asked. No, was the answer. So\nI said OK, leading to the most surreal “operational” moment I would witness\nduring all my years in the military.\n\nThe “prisoner release” was now in full flow. Dozens of military vehicles,\nand a small army of fire engines and ambulances, had also pulled to the far end\nof the runway, out of sight of the hijackers, in case our attack on the Sabena jet\nwent wrong.

That’s true in education, health care, criminal justice and many other areas.\n\nA recent review found that 10 major social programs had been rigorously evaluated over the past two decades,\nusing the scientific gold standard of random assignment. Only one of the 10 — Early Head Start, for infants,\ntoddlers pregnant women — was a clear success. Yet all 10 still exist, and largely in their original form.\n\nJon Baron, the president of the Coalition for Evidence-Based Policy in Washington, points out that the social\nproblems addressed by antipoverty programs have not gotten much better in years. School test scores have\nbarely changed. College graduation rates for low-income students have stagnated. The poverty rate is as high as\nit was in 1981. Median household income is lower than it was in 1998.\n\n“If we just keep funding social programs the way we have been,” Mr. Baron says, “there’s not a lot of reason to\nthink we'll have much success.”\n\nThe Obama administration’s seven pilot programs would create bonds for, among other areas, job training,\neducation, juvenile justice and care of children’s disabilities. Nonprofit groups like Social Finance could apply.\nSo could for-profit companies, said the White House official, who asked not to be named because the president\nhad not yet released next year’s budget. The $100 million for the bonds would come out of the budgets of other\nprograms, to stay consistent with Mr. Obama’s announced freeze on non-security spending.\n\nOfficials in Massachusetts and New York are looking at similar ideas but have not yet decided whether they\nwill issue bonds.\n\nBeyond the impact of any single program, the bonds have the potential to nudge all government agencies to pay\nmore attention to results. Mr. Obama, after all, campaigned as a reformer who wanted to create a sleek, efficient\n“iPod government.” He has had some success, like the expansion of a program — backed by years of solid\nevidence — in which nurses go to the homes of new at-risk parents to counsel them.\n\nOver all, though, the administration has not done enough to improve government efficiency. Put it this way: If\nsomeone asked you how Mr. Obama had made government work better, would you have an answer?\n\nMaking government work better will be all the more important in the years ahead. The free market is not going\nto solve many of our biggest problems, be it stagnant pay or spotty medical care. And government — in\nWashington and locally — is going to be financially squeezed for a long time.\n\nThere never was a good excuse for wasting billions of taxpayer dollars on programs that didn’t work. But now,\nespecially, there’s no excuse.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_030325\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

Terrorism, no less than the worst Arab\nattacks on Israeli civilians. The settler was named Baruch Goldstein, a\nphysician, who lived in Kiryat Arba. One of the first post-1967 Jewish\nsettlements, it sat on a hill outside the West Bank town of Hebron. At the heart\nof Hebron lay the burial place of the patriarchs and matriarchs of the Jewish\nfaith: Abraham and Sarah; Isaac and Rebecca; Jacob and Leah. Since Abraham\nis also revered as a prophet in Islam and a mosque had stood on the site for\nnearly a thousand years, our post-1967 arrangements set out separate times of\nworship for Muslims and Jews. Goldstein chose to attack during a holiday\nperiod for both faiths: Purim for the Jews and the Muslim holy month of\nRamadan. He arrived shortly after the Muslims’ Friday prayers began on the\nmorning on February 25. He was dressed in his reserve army uniform and was\ncarrying an automatic rifle. He opened fire on a group of nearly 800 Palestinian\nworshipers. He had killed 29 and wounded 125 others by the time several of his\nintended victims knocked him unconscious and beat him to death.\n\nI rushed to Sde Dov airport in north Tel Aviv, a few minutes from the kirya,\nand boarded a helicopter for the old British fort near Hebron, used by the\nJordanians until 1967 and now Israeli headquarters. After visiting the scene of\nthe killings, I sought out local Palestinian leaders, to voice my condolences and\nthe sense of outrage I shared over what had happened, and to urge them to do all\nthey could to maintain calm. I then went to Kiryat Arba and conveyed the same\nmessage.\n\nOur immediate task was to prevent more deaths, on either side. It was a\nfrustrating, and violent, week. Protests reminiscent of the first days of the\nintifada erupted around the West Bank, in Gaza, in east Jerusalem and in several\nArab neighborhoods and towns inside Israel. While I had no trouble\nunderstanding the Palestinians’ anger, I also had a responsibility to prevent the\nviolence spiraling out of control. We turned to the same tools we’d used at the\nbeginning of the uprising — though with even greater emphasis on the need for\nsoldiers to use the only the necessary force to restore order, and to avoid causing\nfatalities wherever possible.

But the cost of this strategy is not simply a cost to him; it is a cost to the\nwhole world.\n\n\"On the other hand, Chancellor Merkel is the archetypal worry-wart. She does not lead; she assesses.\n\n\"You really wonder why leaders want these jobs when they really do not want to lead. And what is their risk? That\nBarack Obama will not get a second term? Or that Angela Merkel's coalition might finally end up on the rocks? If\nthey actually made the leap they might astound themselves. Because, in the end, everyone in political life gets\ncarried out - the only relevant question is whether the pallbearers will be crying.\"\n\nFor Keating, the 20th-century leader exerting most influence on the coming century is China's Deng Xiaoping.\n\n\"If you look at the other figures of the century, Roosevelt, Churchill, Stalin and Mao, none will leave the legacy in\nterms of the 21st century that Deng leaves,” he says. \"He walked away from the ideology of the Communist Party\njust as effectively as Mikhail Gorbachev walked away from the essence of the Soviet Union.\"\n\nBy 2050 Keating sees a world order with nations in terms of gross domestic product in this hierarchy: (1) China, (2)\nUS, (3) India, (4) Japan, (5) Brazil, (6) Russia, (7) Britain, (8) Germany, (9) France and (10) Italy.\n\nThe key, however, is that Japan lags a distant fourth behind the top three.\n\nOn America, Keating is dismayed by the pivotal change in its outlook after the end of the Cold War. \"When the\nBerlin Wall came down the Americans cried victory and walked off the field,\" he says.\n\n\"Yet the end of the Cold War offered the chance for America to develop a new world order. It didn't know what to do\nwith its victory. This at the moment the US should have begun exploiting the opportunity of establishing a new world\norder to embrace open regionalism and the inclusion of great states like China, India and the then loitering Russia.\n\n\"Well, frankly, the US didn't have the wisdom. It just wanted to celebrate its peace dividend. The two Clinton terms\nand the two George W. Bush terms, that's four presidential terms, have cost US mightily.”\n\nFor Keating, the malaise in US politics is the problem. He says: \"The most compelling thing I've seen in years is that\nin the great burst of American productivity between 1990 and 2008, of that massive increment to national income,\nnone of it went to wages. By contrast, in Australia real wages over the same period had risen by 30 per cent.\"\nKeating sees this \"as the breakdown of America's national compact\", the shattering of its prosperity deal. He says\nAmerican conservatives abandoned the middle ground represented by Republican presidents such as Dwight D.\nEisenhower, Richard Nixon and Bush Sr and became radicals. The derailment, he argues, began under Ronald\nReagan and reached its zenith under George W. Bush.\n\nWith the goodwill gone the US “is not able to produce a medium-term credible fiscal trajectory or get agreement on\nrebuilding its infrastructure”. This paralysis “is significant not just for the US but for the world.\"\n\nKeating links the collapse of this \"prosperity compact\" to the financial crisis. Too many Americans were unable to\nsustain themselves from wages and salaries.\n\nHow did they get by? They used the easy credit of the banking system, thereby feeding the frenzy that ended in bad\nloans and meltdown.\n\nKeating's book has an abiding message for Australia: in the transformed world we “will find ourselves increasingly\non our own\" having to master our own destiny.\n\nThe job is to rediscover the productivity and savings agenda of the 1990s. Why did Australia survive the 2008\nfinancial crisis? \"Because of the flexibility of the economy,\" Keating says. \"Flexibility which came from the reform of\nAustralia's financial, product and labour markets that began 25 years ago. This has given us one of the most flexible\neconomies in the world - arguably the most flexible. But further structural changes are ahead of us.\"\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_029660\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

GW Pharma’s Epidiolex (highly potent, pure\nformulation of CBD) was approved by the FDA in 2018 for the treatment of seizures\nassociated with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome and Dravet syndrome, and other companies\n(Tilray, MMJ Phytotech, Insys) have clinical trials underway in seizure disorders as well.\nAdditional possible indications for CBD products include autism spectrum disorders,\npsychiatric conditions, diabetic neuropathy pain, fibromyalgia, chronic pain, and back\npain; clinical trials in these indications are underway.\n\nClinical trial results to date demonstrate few adverse effects from oral CBD doses of up\nto 1500 mg/day or up to 30mg IV. Specifically, CBD studies have not reported effects on\nblood pressure, heart rate, or respiratory rate, and no negative changes in mood or\npsychomotor slowing. Some studies (such as GW’s in Epidiolex) have shown side effects\nresulting from high doses of CBD (~2g/day) inhibiting hepatic drug metabolism,\nprompting increased blood levels of some background medications. Additionally, in vitro\nstudies have shown CBD to be pro-apoptotic in lymphocytes and to inhibit IL8 and IL10\nproduction, suggesting that it may suppress the immune system. However, though\nunknowns remain, the summation of pre-clinical and clinical data suggest that the\ncompound is safe at typical doses seen in over the counter products (5-10mg).\n\n—\n\nAdditionally, other cannabinoids (found in CBD distillate) have been discovered that may\nhave differentiated pharmacological effects. For example, cannabidivarin (CBDV) may\nhave differentiated anticonvulsant effects, tetrahydrocannabivarin (THCV) may have\nanti-diabetic and appetite suppressant effects, cannabidiol-acid (CBDA) may have anti-\nnausea effects, and bannabigerol (CBG) may have anti-cancer effects.

Memory is the storage of already-recognized\npatterns, enabling recollection or regeneration of these patterns as needed. Action is the for-\nmation of patterns in the body and world. Prediction is the utilization of temporal patterns to\nguess what perceptions will be seen in the future, and what actions will achieve what effects in\nthe future — in essence, prediction consists of temporal pattern recognition, plus the (implicit\nor explicit) assumption that the universe possesses a \"habitual tendency\" according to which\npreviously observed patterns continue to apply.\n\n1.7.1 Memory and Cognition in CogPrime\n\nEach of these five concepts has a lot of depth to it, and we won’t say too much about them in\nthis brief introductory overview; but we will take a little time to say something about memory\nin particular.\n\nAs we'll see in Chapter 7, one of the things that the mathematical theory of general intelli-\ngence makes clear is that, if you assume your AI system has a huge amount of computational\nresources, then creating general intelligence is not a big trick. Given enough computing power,\na very brief and simple program can achieve any computable goal in any computable environ-\nment, quite effectively. Marcus Hutter’s AT XI\" design [Hut05] gives one way of doing this,\nbacked up by rigorous mathematics. Put informally, what this means is: the problem of AGI is\nreally a problem of coping with inadequate compute resources, just as the problem of natural\nintelligence is really a problem of coping with inadequate energetic resources.\n\nOne of the key ideas underlying CogPrime is a principle called cognitive synergy, which\nexplains how real-world minds achieve general intelligence using limited resources, by appropri-\nately organizing and utilizing their memories.\n\nThis principle says that there are many different kinds of memory in the mind: sensory,\nepisodic, procedural, declarative, attentional, intentional. Each of them has certain learning\nprocesses associated with it; for example, reasoning is associated with declarative memory.\nSynergy arises here in the way the learning processes associated with each kind of memory have\ngot to help each other out when they get stuck, rather than working at cross-purposes.\n\nCognitive synergy is a fundamental principle of general intelligence — it doesn’t tend to play\na central role when you’re building narrow-AI systems.\n\nIn the CogPrime approach all the different kinds of memory are linked together in a single\nmeta-representation, a sort of combined semantic/neural network called the AtomSpace. It\nrepresents everything from perceptions and actions to abstract relationships and concepts and\neven a system’s model of itself and others. When specialized representations are used for other\ntypes of knowledge (e.g. program trees for procedural knowledge, spatiotemporal hierarchies\nfor perceptual knowledge) then the knowledge stored outside the AtomSpace is represented via\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_012926\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

The organization was founded in 2007 with the\nmission of providing free technical skills in the garment industry to the people in the Southeastern department\nof Haiti. Following the earthquake, the living and economic conditions are deplorable. More than ever,\nCEFOTAJ wants to double its effort to help the community of Jacmel out of desperation by providing the youth\nwith valuable sustainable skills. With a trade under their belt, the youth will be more confident while seeking\nemployment.\n\nWe have obtained our 501 - C (3) in 2008 and have recently received the approval of the Haiti’s Department of\nPlanning to be a non-governmental organization (NGO). The organization’s building that will house the\nschool is currently under construction.\n\nBased on our research, we found that you are very committed to helping Haiti. The purpose of this\ncorrespondence is to solicit The Jeffrey Epstein VI Foundation assistance with grant coordination and\nfacilitation to help our organization get off the ground. With potential help from the international community,\nwe believe that the project would be rewarding for the citizens of the city of Jacmel and in line with the\nrequirements of the Haiti Reconstruction Plan and President Obama recent legislation of the “Hope” law..\nPlease find enclosed a copy of the project which provides detailed information about the curriculum for the\ndifferent programs that the school will offer. We trust that you will find this to be an interesting project with\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_019446\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

Alice Jones looks forward to this\nyear's event and the week-long whirl of auctions, exhibitions and parties it brings to London\n\nFriday, 8 October 2010\n\nAs always, the proof will be in the purchasing, but signs that confidence has returned to the market can already\nbe found in the buzz around the traditional run of Frieze week auctions. At Christie's, Hirst will be auctioned\nalongside two works by Gerhard Richter (valued at up to £1m) and, hollow laugh, Andreas Gursky’s\nphotomontage of the New York Stock Exchange, last seen hanging in the boardroom at Lehman Brothers\n(estimate: £100,000 — £150,000). Sotheby's has Jerry Hall's extraordinary collection up for sale — including work by\nFrank Auerbach, Lucian Freud and Andy Warhol. And Phillips de Pury will hope to break the £1m mark with David\nHockney's Autumn Pool while Maurizio Cattelan's Una Domenica a Rivara, a rope of knotted bedsheets to hang\nfrom a window, is estimated to sell at £400,000 to £600,000. Elsewhere, in a bold new addition to the landscape,\n£20m-worth of art will go on sale in an 18th-century mansion part-owned by the Russian real-estate billionaire\nSergei Polonsky. The House of the Noble Man, a stone's throw from Frieze in Cornwall Terrace, is curated by\nVictoria Golembiovskaya and the artist Wolfe von Lenkiewicz and will include four rare Picassos and Cezanne's\nDon Quixote.\n\nFor all of these and more, the international arterati will descend on London next week, jetting in from the\ntraditional hot spots of New York, Berlin and Moscow, as well as from the emerging collector territories of the\nMiddle East, India and China for what is now known simply as Frieze week. It's no longer just about the fair; a\nwhole city's-worth of cultural activity has coalesced around those big white marquees. The breakfast views are\nbooked in, the big museum shows are up and the parties — from a Frieze week opener at the Groucho Club to the\nritzy annual Cartier dinner at Bar Boulud and ArtReview's Power 100 party at Sketch — are planned. After its initial\nstruggles, the hype-filled boom years and fear-filled bust years, Frieze is now firmly established, an unmissable\nstop-off between Basel and Miami on the global art calendar. A decade ago, London didn't even have its own\ncontemporary art fair. Now, for five days in mid- October, the art set wouldn't dream of being anywhere else.\n\n20\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_028300\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

Such\nchurches invite congregants to\nexperience God in their imaginations as\na person. Again, this violates a basic\npsychological expectation: persons have\nfaces to observe and hands to shake.\nHuman relational interactions are based\non sensorial response. Churches like the\nVineyard explicitly suggest that one\nshould imagine a sensorial response\nfrom God and encouraged congregants\nto participate in a kind of let’s pretend\nplay in which God was present. The\npastor suggested one Sunday morning\nthat congregants should put out a second\ncup of coffee for God, and sit down with\nhim to chat. People went on “date night”\nwith God. They would get a sandwich,\nand sit down on park bench to talk with\nGod as they imagined his arm around\ntheir shoulders. They would ask God\ntruly trivial questions like what shirt they\nshould wear in the morning and what\nmovie he thought they would like. These\nbehaviors were clearly play-like. One\ncongregant remarked: “I definitely do\nthat. When I can’t decide what to wear.\nLike, God, what should I wear?” Then\nshe laughed. “And you know, then I kind\nof forget about the fact that I asked God.\nI think God cares about really, really\nlittle things in my life. I mean I know\nGod cares, but I don’t expect him to tell\nme what to wear. I’m like, Oh, I think\nI'll wear that and forget I even asked\nGod!” This invitation to play was C.S.\nLewis’ explicit contribution to twentieth\ncentury Christianity: “let us pretend to\nturn the pretense into a reality.” In\nchurches which encourage such play,\nheresy fades in importance. The pastors\nand the committed congregants worry\nabout “deadness,” not flawed imagining.\n\nThird, congregants must learn to\nrespond emotionally to God as if God is\n\n115\n\nPage\n\nreal. If God is real, a Christian (at least,\nthe modern evangelical Christian) should\nexperience the emotions that one would\nfeel if one were loved unconditionally.\nMost do not. It is, in fact, difficult for\nhumans to experience themselves as\nunconditionally loved because no matter\nhow warm and loving a parent may be,\nat some point the child is expected to\ncontrol his or her behavior and parental\nlove will becomes contingent. The task\nof feeling unconditionally loved imposes\nupon the congregant not only the burden\nof identifying and relating to an invisible\nbeing, but experiencing emotions in\nresponse to that being’s love which the\ncongregant rarely, if ever, truly\nexperiences. Congregants talk about the\nexperience of unconditional love as rare:\nthey speak of “those moments” when\none really feels God’s love.\n\nI was driving home from grocery\nshopping in the car and I stopped at a\nlight and suddenly for no reason that I\ncould come up with, I was weeping and I\nfelt a massive and awesome sense of the\npresence of God in the car with me. It\njust came and I had absolutely no control\nover it. I pulled over to the side of the\nroad—I remember thinking that I was so\nin love with Jesus at that moment that no\none else on the planet could come close.\nAfter about twenty minutes of real\nintensity the feeling subsided somewhat,\nbut the presence of Jesus stayed with me.\nI drove home not really ever able to fully\nexpress what happened without sounding\nlike ’'d taken something illegal.\n\nThe more immediate aim seemed to be\nto experience what Galatians 5:22-23\ncalls the “fruits of the spirit”: love, joy,\npeace, patience and so forth.

Conservatives like\nthings as they are, even if “as they are” is sometimes broken or dysfunctional or\ndangerous. Revolutionaries are different. They don’t seem to choose their role.

Luther would tell you that his first inspiration had come to\nhim one night in the summer of 1505, while he was walking home in a\nthunderstorm, when a lightning bolt landed a foot or two away.!°° Luther had been\nstruggling for years with an inner battle, with a tension between his faith and what\nit demanded of him. Then, when that lightning cracked free from the storm, a\nsensation of total terror was replaced by a new feeling. The nearness and power of\nGod snapped past him in that moment. It clarified everything. He dropped his law\nstudies the next day and within a year he was an Augustinian monk, preaching -\noften hundreds of sermons a year, ever angrier, ever clearer — about the closeness of\nGod, the real, tangible, bolt-from-the-blue passage of faith to faith. He was totally,\ncompletely converted.\n\n106 Luther would tell you: Albert Beutel “Luther’s Life” in Ed. Donald K.

They\nare generally all in agreement, but can denote distinct cultural effects. These distinctions are not explored\nin this paper.\n\nFor example, we give in Appendix measures for the frequency of the word ‘evolution’. In the first three\ncolumns, we give the number of times it appeared, the normalized number of times it appeared (relative\nto #words that year), the normalized number of pages it appeared in, and the normalized number of\nbooks it appeared in, as a function of the date.\n\nIII.1B. Multiple Query/Cohort Timelines\n\nWhere indicated, timeline plots may reflect the aggregates of multiple query results, such as a cohort of\nindividuals or inventions. In these cases, the raw data for each query we used to associate each year with\na set of frequencies. The plot was generated by choosing a measure of central tendency to characterize\nthe set of frequencies (either mean or median) and associating the resulting value with the corresponding\nyear.\n\nSuch methods can be confounded by the vast frequency differences among the various constituent\nqueries. For instance, the mean will tend to be dominated by the most frequent queries, which might be\nseveral orders of magnitude more frequent than the least frequent queries. If the absolute frequency of\nthe various query results is not of interest, but only their relative change over time, then individual query\nresults may be normalized so that they yield a total of 1. This results in a probability mass function for\neach query describing the likelihood that a random instance of a query derives from a particular year.\nThese probability mass functions may then be summed to characterize a set of multiple queries. This\napproach eliminates bias due to inter-query differences in frequency, making the change over time in the\ncohort easier to track.\n\nIlI.2. Note on collection of historical and cultural data\n\nIn performing the analyses described in this paper, we frequently required additional curated datasets of\nvarious cultural facts, such as dates of rule of various monarchs, lists of notable people and inventions,\nand many others. We often used Wikipedia in the process of obtaining these lists. Where Wikipedia is\nmerely digitizing the content available in another source (for instance, the blacklists of Wolfgang\nHermann), we corrected the data using the original sources. In other cases this was not possible, but we\nfelt that the use of Wikipedia was justifiable given that (i) the data — including all prior versions - is publicly\navailable; (ii) it was created by third parties with no knowledge of our intended analyses; and (iii) the\nspecific statistical analyses performed using the data were robust to errors; i.e., they would be valid as\nlong as most of the information was accurate, even if some fraction of the underlying information was\nwrong. (For instance, the aggregate analysis of treaty dates as compared to the timeline of the\ncorresponding treaty, shown in the control section, will work as long as most of the treaty names and\ndates are accurate, even if some fraction of the records is erroneous.\n\nWe also used several datasets from the Encyclopedia Britannica, to confirm that our results were\nunchanged when high-quality carefully curated data was used. For the lexicographic analyses, we relied\nprimarily on existing data from the American Heritage Dictionary.\n\nWe avoided doing manual annotation ourselves wherever possible, in an effort to avoid biasing the\nresults.

The results will be announced when laying the\nfoundation stone with full details, and the time of laying the foundation stone before 2020 without a\ndoubt.\n\n* The islands. Have you finished the subject of islands?\n- There were no problems with the islands originally.\n* We heard the Egyptian media speaks about the subject that within the corridors of the courts?\n\n- which occurred about a year ago is only a delimitation of the maritime boundaries. The islands are\nregistered with Egypt as a Saudi islands and they are registered with Kingdom of Saudi Arabia as Saudi\nislands. And are also, registered in the international centers as Saudi islands. Only the demarcation of\nthe maritime borders has been done. Both Egypt and Saudi Arabia has not relinquished any part of their\nterritories. The demarcation of the border came for reasons of economic benefits that could be created\nafter the demarcation of these borders, especially the King Salman Bridge, oil supply, gas supplies,\npower supply or train and roads that will target the port in North Sinai, and the exports of Gulf countries\nto Europe.\n\n* |s it possible to see in the future a direct dialogue with Iran, despite what it is doing in the region?\n\n- How to reach an understanding with one who has the regime is firmly convinced that his system is\nbased on the ideology of extremism enshrined in the Constitution and stipulated in the command of\nKhomeini that he must control the Muslims of the Islamic world and the dissemination of the doctrine of\nJaafari-Ethna Ashry ethnic of them throughout the Islamic world until the Mahdi appears. How can |\nconvince this person? What are the interests between me and him? When | have a problem with\nanother state, we start to solve it. For example, if there is an economic problem there is a continuation\nof what you want and what we want and how we understand it. Or a political problem, for example with\nRussia how to cooperate in Syria. What are your interests and what are mine.

Rev. 835, *885\n\nthe duty of the trial court [in considering whether to approve a jury trial waiver] is not to be discharged as a mere matter of rote,\nbut with sound and advised discretion, with an eye to avoid unreasonable or undue departures from that mode of trial or from\nany of the essential elements thereof, and with a caution increasing in degree as the offenses dealt with increase in gravity. 716\n\nThis is a \"serious and weighty responsibility.\" 7!9\n\n[*886] To discharge that serious and weighty responsibility, the trial court should receive as much information as possible.\nThe victim is often well situated to provide information about how the public will view a non-jury trial. The proposed rule\nchange takes the modest step of requiring the court to hear the victim before approving any non-jury trial, a step that is\nconsistent with the CVRA's command that victims be treated with fairness.\n\nImportantly, this change would not interfere with defendants’ rights. The Supreme Court has squarely held that the defendant\nlacks any constitutional right to unilaterally elect a bench trial. 72° Of course, in some circumstances, despite a victim's\nobjection, a non-jury trial nonetheless will be appropriate. Moreover, in extreme cases, the defendant may have a right to a non-\njury trial where pretrial publicity has pervasively tainted the jury pool. 72! Nothing in the proposed rule change would interfere\nwith a court's right to approve a bench trial in such circumstances, so long as the court considers the victim's perspective as part\nof the approval process.\n\nRule 32(a) - Deleting Old Definition of \"Victim\"\n\nThe Proposal:\n\nThe definition of \"victim\" currently contained in Rule 32 should be stricken as follows:\nRule 32. Sentencing and Judgment\n\n(a) Definitions. The following definitions apply under this rule:\n\n(1) \"Crime of violence or sexual abuse\" means:\n\n(A) a crime that involves the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against another's person or property; or\n\n(B) a crime under /8 U.S.C. 2241-2248 or 2251-2257.\n[*887]\n\n(2) \"Victim\" means an individual against whom the defendant committed an offense for which the court will impose sentence.\nThe Rationale:\n\nThe old definition of victim in Rule 32 is now too narrow, as it is limited to crimes of violence or sexual abuse. The CVRA, in\ncontrast, includes all victims within its protections. In the proposed new rules, \"victim\" would be defined in Rule 1. 77?\nAccordingly, the narrower definition found here can simply be eliminated.

They must talk about and write about\nwhat they do until the description process becomes second nature to\nthem. So, describing cannot be taught in and of itself. It must be part\nand parcel of other events students undertake. Writing classes make\nno sense, therefore. They exist because of the subject-based divisions\nin school. Writing and speaking must be part of everything that is go-\ning on.\n\nSUMMARY\n\nProficiency at all the cognitive processes depends on discovery and\nbeing able to extrapolate from one’s experience about what has been\ndiscovered. These processes depend strongly on prior cases, and prior\ncases are best learned slowly in childhood. They also depend on an\nanalysis of those cases, which is best done with help from a teacher.\nDiscussion, reflection, and analysis of prior cases make one better able\nto deal with new cases. New cases must be compared with old ones\nin a way that helps one reason better from them. This comparison is\nthe basis of teaching analytic cognitive processes. Learning cognitive\nprocesses means having prior experiences with events that are similar\nto current events and being able to extrapolate from them. When we\ngo to a doctor, we want one who has seen our problem, and described\nit to others, many times before. Only then can we detect the nuances\nof difference that will determine an effective course of action.\n\nTeaching cognitive processes means providing students with ex-\nperiences, hopefully each one more complex than the one before,\nand helping students discuss those experiences and compare one with\nanother. Knowledge is experience, but it is experience that has been\nanalyzed so that it can be retrieved again just in time as needed. This\nwill happen only if we have thought about what we have experienced.\n\nA teacher’s job, therefore, is to help provide the experiences and\nto help the student reflect upon the significance of those experiences.\nGood parents do this naturally. Good teachers would do it naturally as\nwell, if they were allowed to do so. Helping someone see the world in\na new way is pretty much what good teaching is all about.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_023881\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

U.S. GAAP\nrequires an accounting of all assets, liabilities, revenue, and\n\nexpenses as well as extensive disclosures concerning the\n\ncompany’s operations and financial condition. A company’s\nfinancial statements should be complete and fairly repre-\nsent the company’s financial condition.”” Thus, under US.\nGAAP, any payments to foreign government officials must\nbe properly accounted for in a company’s books, records,\nand financial statements.\n\nUS. laws, including SEC Rules, require issuers to\nundergo an annual external audit of their financial statements\nand to make those audited financial statements available to\nthe public by filing them with SEC. SEC Rules and the rules\nand standards issued by the Public Company Accounting\nOversight Board (PCAOB) under SEC oversight, require\nexternal auditors to be independent of the companies that\nthey audit. Independent auditors must comply with the rules\nand standards set forth by the PCAOB when they perform\nan audit of a public company. These audit standards govern,\nfor example, the auditor’s responsibility concerning material\nerrors, irregularities, or illegal acts by a client and its officers,\ndirectors, and employees. Additionally, the auditor has a\nresponsibility to obtain an understanding of an entity’s inter-\nnal controls over financial reporting as part of its audit and\nmust communicate all significant deficiencies and material\nweaknesses identified during the audit to management and\nthe audit committee.”\n\nUnder Section 10A of the Exchange Act, indepen-\ndent auditors who discover an illegal act, such as the pay-\nment of bribes to domestic or foreign government officials,\nhave certain obligations in connection with their audits of\npublic companies. ’”* Generally, Section 10A requires audi-\ntors who become aware of illegal acts to report such acts to\nappropriate levels within the company and, if the company\n\nfails to take appropriate action, to notify SEC.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_022547\n\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

After recent\nrevelations, such as the secret enrichment site near Qom, the former\nis more true.

Epstein purports to find a cause of action for this by alleging that Edwards somehow\nwas involved in “’pumping’ these three cases to investors.”\n\nAs just explained, to the extent that Epstein is alleging that Edwards somehow did\nsomething related to the Ponzi scheme, those allegations fail for the simple reason that Edwards\nwas not involved in any such scheme. Edwards, for example, could not have possibly “pumped”\nthe cases to investors when he never paatioinated in any communication with investors.\n\nEpstein’s “pumping” claims, however, fail for an even more basic reason: Edwards was\nmnfitiad — indeed ethically obligated as an attorney — to secure the maximum recovery for his\nclients during the course of his legal representation. As is well known, “[a]s an advocate, a\nlawyer zealously asserts the client’s position under the rules of the adversary system.” Fla, Rules\nof Prof. Conduct, Preamble. Edwards therefore was required to pursue (unless otherwise\ninstructed by his clients) a maximum recovery against Epstein. Edwards, therefore, cannot be\nliable for doing something that his ethical duties as an attorney required.”\n\nAnother reason that Epstein’s claims that Edwards was “pumping” cases for investors\nfails is that Edwards filed all three cases almost a year before he was hired by RRA or even knew\nof Scott Rothstein. Epstein makes allegations that the complaints contained sensational\nallegations for the purposes of luring investors; however, language in the complaints remained\nvirtually unchanged from the first filing in 2008 and from the overwhelming evidence the Court\ncan see for itself that all of the facts alleged by Edwards in the complaints were true.\n\n: Epstein ultimately paid to settle all three of the cases Edwards filed against him for more\n— than he paid to settle any of the other claims against him. At Epstein’s request, the terms\n\nIn a further effort to harass Edwards, Epstein also filed a bar complaint with the Florida Bar against Edwards. The\nFlorida Bar has dismissed that complaint.

We don't need innocence. We don't need sexual\nmystery. We don't need to eliminate teen sex. We don't need to re-establish some\nlimiting, patriarchal \"manly ideal.\" But they've got one thing right: we do need to start\ntalking about sex as something that is not mostly mechanical -- as something that, yes,\ncan be \"a private sphere for the creation of human meaning.”\n\n3. [wish I'd learned this: \"Good sex doesn't just require two (or more) people who like\nsex. It requires desire -- and desire simply doesn't work the same way for everyone.\"\n\nI've said before that I went through a period -- back when I was first becoming sexually\nactive -- where I simply could not figure out why sexual acts with people I didn't care\nabout didn't seem to turn me on. Or rather -- they turned me on a little, but not... much. It\ntook me a while to understand that sex requires more than just two eager people. It\nrequires attraction and desire.\n\nWhen I was fifteen or so, and at summer camp, I remember making out with a boy. I\ndidn't really want to make out with him, but I wasn't sure how to reject him (more on this\nunder point 5). And I figured: he seems nice enough, so I might as well make out with\nhim. Afterwards, I felt angry at myself, and I felt like I'd wasted my time -- and I felt\nconfused. I'd been bored at best and repulsed at worst, and I wasn't sure why I felt that\nway, or why I'd done something that made me feel that way.\n\nSo why had I done it? Because I'd thought: \"Sex is value-neutral.\" Because I'd thought:\n\"Making out is fun, right? -- that means I ought to do it when I get the chance!\" Because\nI'd thought: \"My preference not to make out with him is probably just some silly\nrepression that I need to get over.\" Because I didn't understand that desire is complicated,\nthat you can't just make yourself feel desire when it's convenient, and that you don't need\na reason for your attractions -- or lack of attraction. This situation was to reprise itself in\nvarious forms over the next years, until I finally learned that sometimes you simply want\nor don't want things, and that you aren't required to justify your desires.\n\n4. I wish I'd gotten a list of suggestions: \"Here are some places you might go to start\nfiguring out what turns you on.\"\n\nI was told that sex was fun. I was even told to explore! But I still spent years with very\nlittle actual idea of what I wanted. No one ever told me how or where I might be able to\nlearn more about my needs, or what exploring my needs might look like. And no one ever\nexplained that people are turned on by different things, that some people like some sex\nacts and don't like others, and that's okay.\n\nI went into sex with a buffet-style attitude, thinking that I must naturally enjoy sex\nequally in all ways. I was so surprised when I found out that I like some positions better\nthan others! I remember how confused I was when I dated a guy who didn't like fellatio,\nand how hurt I felt -- like his lack of enjoyment meant that I must be doing it wrong,\nbecause everyone likes oral sex, right?\n\nAnd of course, while I had a pretty comprehensive idea of the vanilla sex acts I could\nexperiment with, I had very little idea of what else was out there. In retrospect I find this\nhilarious, but I remember -- back in my vanilla days -- I had two boyfriends who tied me\nup. They tied me up and were nice to me, and I suppose it was amusing enough, but\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_018463\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

As a practical matter, many of the calculations supporting a restitution\naward will rest on information in the presentence report. While the restitution statutes have their own detailed procedural\n\nprovisions, 7°4\n\nthe presentence report is clearly a central part of the restitution process. If a presentence report fails to\naccurately recount restitution figures, crime victims may be short-changed. For all these reasons, the CVRA should be\nunderstood as giving victims the right to review relevant parts of the presentence report and to be heard before a court makes\nany final conclusions about Guidelines calculations and other sentencing issues. Many states follow a similar approach and\ngive victims access to the presentence report. 7>°\n\nIn February 2005, I testified before the Sentencing Commission to recommend a change in the U.S. Sentencing Commission\nGuidelines Manual along the lines of the proposals contained in this [*897] Article. *°° In particular, I suggested that the\nCommission change its current rule, which allows only the parties to see the presentence report. 7°’ The Practitioners’\n\nAdvisory Group to the Sentencing Commission later disputed my proposal. In a letter to the Commission, 7*8\n\nthey argued that\n\"nothing in the CVRA or its legislative history states that crime victims should be permitted to review portions of the\npresentence report, dispute guidelines calculations, raise grounds for departure, or, as such rights would seem to imply, appeal a\nsentence on factual or legal grounds.\" 7°? The Practitioners’ Group also cited the drafting history of the proposed constitutional\namendment protecting victims’ rights, which they thought was limited to giving a victim merely the right to \"allocute\" at\nsentencing - that is, merely to provide victim impact information. 7°°\n\nThe Practitioners' Group's arguments are flawed for several reasons. First, the Group too narrowly views the relevant legislative\nhistory of the CVRA. As explained above, Congress intended for victims to have broad rights in the sentencing process,\nincluding rights to be reasonably heard in a meaningful manner. 7°! It is not reasonable to deprive victims of the critical\ninformation in the presentence report. Second, the Practioners' Group inaccurately describes the relevant history of the Victims’\nRights Amendment. It is true that the proposed constitutional amendment contained a right to be \"reasonably heard,\" just as the\nCVRA does.

I knew the man who was now in overall command of the paratroopers even\nbetter: Uzi Yairi, who was in charge of Sayeret Matkal during my final years of\nreserve duty at Hebrew University. Helicoptered into the Sinai just hours\nearlier, the paratroopers had been sent to the Chinese Farm shortly before\nmidnight. As I would soon learn, they had no more idea than I did about what\nthey were about to face. They were told they were going in simply to clear out\nbands of “tank-hunters”. They weren ’t told of repeated attempts by some of\nArik’s top tank, paratroop and reconnaissance units to take the farm over the\nprevious 36 hours — attacks which had not only failed, but had cost dozens of\ntanks and hundreds of men. Without artillery, armor or air support, they\nimmediately came under rifle, machine-gun, mortar and heavy artillery fire.\n\nOur job was to get them out. Ordering my men to get ready for our first\ncombat mission of the war, I found myself face-to-face with a distraught and\ndetermined friend from military intelligence. Yishai Izhar had arrived at Bren’s\nheadquarters the day before. When he saw me, he’d asked to join my battalion.\nHe was a brilliant electronics engineer and was about to assume command of\nthe technology unit in military intelligence. I told him we already had our\ncomplement of tank crews, and I knew he’d never had any armored training. So\nI found him a place in one of our APCs. But before joining military intelligence,\nhe’d been a company commander in Battalion 890. Hearing that we were going\nto rescue his old unit, he insisted on joining me on the lead tank. I tried several\ntimes to refuse, but he said I had no moral authority to stash him in an APC\nwhen we were going in to rescue his friends and comrades. Aware that each\nwasted minute might cost more of the paratroopers’ lives, I relented. I told\nYishai he’d be sitting across from me on the turret, right above Yasha Kedmi,\nanother friend who, having served under me in my first tank company in the\nWar of Attrition, had asked to join back at Julis. Yasha was our loader and\nradio-operator. He got Yishai a machine gun, extra magazines for his Uzi and a\nbox of grenades.\n\nWe moved out through wave-like dunes in total darkness. After the first few\nmiles, the terrain leveled out a bit. Still, the sand was deep and the going slow.\nWhen we got within a couple of miles of where I assumed Yitzhik and his men\nwould be, I radioed him. His voice was chilling. ““They’re very close to us,\nshooting,” he said. “I’ve got many wounded.

Most people think that if you are a\ndoctor, then you must be smart, but if you push on this belief, you\nfind that what people actually think is that a doctor had to go to\nschool for a really long time, learn of lot of complicated material, and\nthen work really hard as an intern and then as a resident. People re-\nspect doctors and may well think that the doctor is the smartest per-\nson in their small town, but that is typically because she is likely the\nmost educated person in that town. They easily may not consider her\nto have “common sense,” which is one way that ordinary people de-\nscribe their perception of intelligent behavior.\n\nDiagnosis is done by plumbers, detectives, engineers, and beau-\nty care professionals as well. Diagnosis is a very important cognitive\nprocess to learn. Learning to do it well often means the difference\nbetween success and failure on the job and personally. Can the inter-\nviewees do diagnosis? Miss South Carolina can.\n\nShe asserts that her friends can locate the United States on a map\nof the world. She can find contradictory evidence for the proposition\npresented to her, which is certainly part of diagnosis. The Palin inter-\nviewees have done diagnosis as well. They have determined what is\nwrong with the country. They may not have done much more than\nlisten to someone on talk radio, but they came to a conclusion based\non the evidence presented to them.\n\nBut they have done it badly. That is why they seem stupid.\n\nComing up with an accurate diagnosis requires intelligence. Ev-\neryone does diagnosis, but we seek counsel from those who do it bet-\nter than others. Diagnostic ability is a hallmark of intelligence.\n\nWhat about causation? Let’s consider Miss South Carolina’s revised\nremarks again:\n\n“Personally, my friends and I, we know exactly where the United\nStates is on a map,” she said. “I don’t know anyone else who\ndoesn’t. If the statistics are correct, I believe there should be more\nemphasis on geography in our education so people will learn\nhow to read maps better.”\n\nMiss South Carolina thinks “there should be more emphasis on ge-\nography in our education so people will learn to read maps better.”\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_023895\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

In\nthis classic interpretation of God as\ncreator, the idea refers not to the origins\nof the universe but rather to the all-\ninclusive dependence of life upon God at\nall times. This sense of a sustaining\ndivine presence spanning the whole time\nof one’s life thus contributes a deep\nsense of one’s connection to the whole\norder of creation. However, as Tanner\nnotes, people may become inattentive to\na presence so pervasive, just as people\ncan become inattentive to the forces of\ngravity holding them to the surface of\nthe Earth as they go about their everyday\nlife. In more extreme versions of this\ninattention, the person understands\nhumanity as “alone” in the universe, a\nsort of metaphysical loneliness that\nmight exacerbate more concrete feelings\nof loneliness.\n\nPerhaps surprisingly, Chris Masi,\nfrom the perspective of a physician and\nmedical researcher, casts a fascinating\nand fresh perspective on the theological\nnotion that we live in a sustaining\nconnection to creation as a whole.

We have maintained a core view that USD/JPY\nwould move higher in 2017, as the factors weighing on the pair this year, namely\nspeculative JPY buying and increased FX hedging by domestic investors (S/¥’s eventual\nsurge), would subside. We like the trade for the following reasons.\n\n« USD/JPY most sensitive to fiscal-stimulus-driven rise in US yields: Of all G10\nFX pairs, JPY is most vulnerable (versus the USD) to a fiscal-driven rise in US yields.\nFirst, the pair’s correlation with rate differentials is the highest in G10 at 60%. But,\nmore importantly, USD/JPY is also the most sensitive to the shape of the US 2s10s\ncurve (Chart 18). The shift from loose monetary/tight fiscal to a tight monetary/\nloose fiscal policy regime will support such a steepening as supply is concentrated\nin the intermediate part of the curve, and the positive growth shock allows the Fed\nto hike faster, supporting an increase in real yields, also a key 2017 call.\n\n¢ BO) yield target is bearish for JPY: The BO)’s implementation of a yield target at\nits September meeting has caused a break in the correlation between 10Y JGBs and\nUSTs (Chart 19). First, given USD/JPY’s significant correlation with 10Y yield\ndifferentials (>60%}, the anchoring of 10Y yields will further weigh on the Yen as\nUS Treasury yields rise. Second, further Japanese fiscal stimulus will successfully\nlower real yields through higher breakeven rates of inflation while nominal yields\nwill remain unchanged. As our JPY strategist argues, to the extent that a Trump\nvictory has weakened Abe’s diplomatic success, not least from likely TPP failure,\nand residual macro uncertainty makes it increasingly likely the government will seek\nto draft a supplementary budget sooner than anticipated.\n\n« _HIA and domestic flow picture a JPY-negative: The flow picture also turns JPY-\nnegative in 2017. USD/JPY’s underperformance during Asia trading hours in 2016\nhighlights that domestics used any rally in the pair to hedge (by selling USD/JPY)\nexisting investments. This flow will likely subside in 2017.

EM\nexchange rates could appreciate swiftly against major currencies (USD, EUR, and JPY).\n\n& Negative scenario\n¢ Global growth prospects suffer a prolonged deterioration and the European debt crisis intensifies. EM\nexchange rates could see a significant, although likely temporary, sell-off across regions.\n\nNote: Scenarios refer to global economic scenarios (see slide 7)\n\n> 5% outperformance of EM FX against G4 currencies over a 6-month horizon\n\n> 5% depreciation of EM FX across regions against USD over a 6-month horizon\n\nWhat we're watching Why it matters\n\nInflation dynamics\ninEM\n\nInflation dynamics are important to forecast central bank policy rate\ndecisions.

Key policy rate announcement dates: 11 Nov,\nIndonesia; Nov 20, Turkey; Nov 22, South Africa; Nov 30, Mexico\n\nEuropean sovereign crisis Setbacks in sentiment will likely lead to bouts of EM currency depreciation,\n\nproviding attractive entry points for longer term investors.\n\nGrowth Growth in the US, Europe, and China is key for risk sentiment, growth\n\nprospects in EM. Key date: Dec 6, European Central Bank meeting\n\n2 UBS\n\nRecommendations\n\nTactical (6 months)\n\ne Several EM currencies look attractive at\ncurrent levels and we advise investors to\nkeep existing holdings for further gains\nwhile increasing exposure to our\npreferred EM currencies (KRW, SGD, MYR,\nMXN, TRY, PLN, ZAR), using the JPY, USD,\nand EUR for funding.\n\nStrategic (1 to 2 years)\n\ne We recommend EM currencies backed by\nstable fundamentals as a strategy to\ndiversify currency exposure.\n\ne Our favorites include the Chilean peso,\nMexican peso, Czech koruna, Polish zloty,\nChinese renminbi, Korean won, Malaysian\nringgit, and Singapore dollar.\n\nUBS CIO EM FX forecasts\n\n24.10.2012 3-month 6-month  12-month\n\nAmericas\n\nUSDBRL 2.02 1.95 1.90 1.85\nUSDMXN 12.9 12.7 12.5 12.3\nAsia\n\nUSDCNY 6.25 6.30 6.30 6.20\nUSDINR 53.6 53.0 54.0 55.0\nUSDIDR 9.615 9,400 9,400 9,400\nUSDKRW 1,103 1,100 1,080 1,050\nUSDSGD 1.22 1.21 1.20 1.19\nEMEA\n\nEURPLN 4.12 4.30 4.15 3.90\nEURHUF 280 290 300 300\nURCZK 24.9 26.0 25.0 24.3\nUSDTRY 1.80 1.75 1.75 1.72\nUSDZAR 8.66 8.20 7.90 7.80\nUSDRUB 31.1 33.0 32.0 31.0\n\nSource: Bloomberg, UBS, as of 15 October 2012\nNote: Past performance is not an indication of future returns.\n\nFor further information please contact ClO's asset class specialists Michael Bolliger, michael.bolliger@ubs.com or Teck Leng Tan, teck-leng.tan@ubs.com 32\n\nPlease see important disclaimer and disclosures at the end of the document.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_025279\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

They will notice things he could never hope to see -\nsmall but portentous changes in your heartbeat, chemical chimeras from new\nmedications, how you're feeling in each moment until your last.\n\nIt is the nature of networks that they create both massive concentration and\ndistribution. And in the process they simply rip apart many of our existing\nstructures. Look at our worrisome global economics at the moment. Extreme\nconcentration of wealth on one end and massive distribution of work tools to ever-\ncheaper sources of labor runs on this exact same logic: it is a sort of jawing network\neffect that is tearing up the middle class, producing an ever-richer elite. Those who\nhave information in financial markets, for instance, possess a secret and vital and\never sharper edge over those who don’t. Which makes them richer still. Which\nsharpens their cutting edge still finer. If we ask ourselves why the world now feels\non the edge of a deflationary shock - a moment where there is more supply than\nthere is demand, where the world waits to buy because “tomorrow it will be\ncheaper” and sends economies spiraling as a result - one reason is this way in which\nnetworks are pulling on our economics. On the one hand, wealth is concentrated in\nfewer and fewer hands by the leverage of knowledge and a head start and\nconnection — a phenomenon knowyn, in fact, as a “rich club” distribution by network\ntheorists. The middle class is locked out of this group. Their wealth and power and\ninfluence declines, as a result. This slashes overall demand, since a billionaire\nconsumes less of each additional dollar than, say, a school teacher. At the same time,\nmassive distribution of technology and connection is reducing demand for labor\nwhile flooding the world with commodities, workers, newly linked-supply of items\nlike bedrooms and car seats.\n\nThe network effect works its usual jawing destruction here: Connection decreases\ndemand and increases supply. It concentrates capital in a few hands, even as it\ndistributes tools of work to cheaper and more distributed people and machines. The\nmiddle is class torn inexorably apart from both ends. It’s not wrong to wonder, as\nsome economists have, if capitalism is a system best yoked to older, slower\npuritanical values that encouraged saving, not consumption - and to ask if wiring\nmarkets to instant networks is not, in the end like trying to warp speed a carriage.\nAnyhow placing an economy on a network surface produces new, ripping pressures\nas apparent in middle-income nations as they are in middle class households. “We\nare being destroyed,” a South Korean friend said to me about the hollowing out of\nhis national economy. Korean computer and television and compute manufacturers\nhad hoped they could develop their own essential software, that their hardware\nmanufacturing technology would be unmatchable.

Because Adolf Hitler is only one of many names, the list as a whole nevertheless\nexhibits strong evidence of suppression, especially because the measure we retained (median usage) is\nrobust to such outliers.\n\n3) Degenerate artists\n\nThe list of degenerate artists was taken directly from the catalog of a recent exhibition at the Los Angeles\nCounty Museum of Art which endeavored to reconstruct the original ‘Degenerate Art’ exhibition (Ref $15).\n\n4) People with recorded ties to Nazis\n\nThe list of Nazi party members was generated in a manner consistent with the occupation categories in\nsection 7. We included the following Wikipedia categories: Nazis_from_outside_Germany, Nazi_leaders,\nSS_officers, Holocaust_perpetrators, Officials_of_Nazi_Germany, Nazis_convicted_of_war_crimes,\ntogether with all of their subcategories, with the exception of Nazis_from_outside_Germany. In addition,\nthe three categories German_Nazi_politicians, Nazi_physicians, Nazis were included without their\nrespective subcategories.\n\nIII.9B. De Novo Identification of Censored and Suppressed Individuals\n\nWe began with the list of 56,500 people, comprising the 500 most famous individuals born in each year\nfrom 1800 — 1913. This list was derived from the analysis of all biographies in Wikipedia described in\nsection 7. We removed all individuals whose mean frequency in the German language corpus was less\nthan 5 x 10™ during the period from 1925 — 1933; because their frequency is low, a statistical assessment\nof the effect of censorship and suppression on these individuals is more susceptible to noise.\n\nThe suppression index is computed for the remaining individuals using an observed/expected measure.\nThe expected fame for a given year is computed by taking the mean frequency of the individual in the\nGerman language from 1925-1933, and the mean frequency of the individual from 1955-1965. These two\nvalues are assigned to 1929 and 1960, respectively; linear interpolation is then performed in order to\ncompute an expected fame value in 1939. This expected value is compared to the observed mean\nfrequency in the German language during the period from 1933-1945. The ratio of these two numbers is\nthe suppression index s. The complete list of names and suppression indices is included as supplemental\ndata. The distribution of s was plotted for using a logarithmic binning strategy, with 100 bins between 10°\nand 10°. Three specific individuals who received scores indicating suppression in German are indicated\non the plot by arrows (Walter Gropius, Pablo Picasso, and Hermann Maas).\n\nAs a point of comparison, the entire analysis was repeated for English; these results are shown on the\nplot.\n\nIII.9C. Validation by an expert annotator\n\nWe wanted to see whether the findings of this high-throughput, quantitative approach were consistent\nwith the conclusions of an expert annotator using traditional, qualitative methods. We created a list of 100\nindividuals at the extremes of our distribution, including the names of the fifty people with the largest s\nvalue and of the fifty people with the smallest s value. We hired a guide at Yad Vashem with advanced\ndegrees in German and Jewish literature to manually annotate these 100 names based on her\nassessment of which people were suppressed by the Nazis (S), which people would have benefited from\nthe Nazi regime (B), and lastly, which people would not obviously be affected in either direction (N). All\n100 names were presented to the annotator in a single, alphabetized list; the annotator did not have\naccess to any of our methods, data, or conclusions. Thus the annotators assessment is wholly\nindependent of our own.\n\n28\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_017036\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

One suggestion for maintaining control over advanced systems that pose\nrisks from the combination of the above considerations is to limit the system's ability to access\nincreasing resources.\n\nTo make this situation concrete, consider an installation of a reinforcement-learning task scheduler for\na group of distributed data centres (e.g. Amazon Web Services). The goal of the algorithm is to\nminimize time-to-execution of the tasks sent to the system by users. As part of its general scheduling\nremit, it is also responsible for scheduling its own optimization sub-processes. The system has a clear\nincentive to control an increasing set of compute resources, both for increasing its optimization power\nand for achieving its main goal of reducing time-to-execution. Aware of these considerations, the\nengineers of the system put in place various hard-coded limits on the amount of resources the system\ncan access, but these limits can be subverted through privilege escalation, masquerading as other\ntasks, manipulation of users, physical control, etc.\n\nPOSSIBLE TRAJECTORY\n\ne Ateam within a large tech corporation that has both ML development capacities and cloud\ncomputing capacities is tasked with improving task scheduling on distributed compute resources.\n\ne The team decides to deploy an out-of-the-box reinforcement learning package developed in-house\nby the ML research teams.\n\ne The inputs for the system are current loads on the different machines, the incoming tasks queue\n(including priority for different tasks), and historical data on task runtimes. The output is an\nassignment of tasks to machines. The loss function is the priority-weighted time-to-execute.\n\ne The system performs well in a test environment (where the RL is running on a single cluster of\ndedicated machines), and is rolled-out.\n\ne A few months later, the system starts to run out of memory, and a tech-infrastructure engineer\ndecides to switch the system from a fixed-capacity setting to a load-balanced setting.\n\ne Now an output of the system (assignment of the RL task to a machine) is coupled to the objective\nof the machine (reducing runtime), and the resulting feedback loop drives the RL agent to spawn an\nincreasing amount of RL tasks with very high priority.\n\n15\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_014711\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

If a manger neither buys nor sells, she tells us\nthat she thinks the price is right. The critical variable is not trade volume, but\n\npercent of aggregate market cap controlled by asset managers collectively.\n\nThe number of asset managers is much less critical. There must be enough for\ncompetition within each specialty or sector of investment. Too many is nota\nconcern. Abler ones, on microeconomic principle, will displace the less able. That’s\nwhy Herbert Spencer taught that natural selection works the same in economics as\n\nin biology.\n\nA particular reason for preferring index ETFs as omnibus fund investments is for\ncheaper liquidity. The omnibus fund must compete with banks in accommodating\npayments and other withdrawals (redemptions). Popular index ETFs such as\nspiders (SPDRs, for Standard and Poor’s Depository Receipts) are bought and sold in\nseconds for a fee of a couple of basis points. So are Treasury ETFs. Thus the omnibus\nfund might do best not to include actual corporate bond ETFs in reintegrating the\ncorporate sector. Treasuries of equal value should do about as well at much lower\n\ntrading cost. Easy liquidity is essential.\n\nWhy Omnibus?\n\nOmnibus means for everyone as well as of everything. It is all-inclusive either way.\nIndividuals differ in risk tolerance. An omnibus fund provides for all. The portfolio\nof index exposures to riskier equity claims and safer debt claims is meant to satisfy\naverage risk tolerance as a whole. Individual accounts then choose short-leg hedges\nor long-leg exposure or anything between. An omnibus portfolio best matches\n\naggregate risk and return to individual claims on it.\n\nOther approaches would work too. A broad-based equity index fund, targeting say\nthe S&P 500 or Russell 3000, could give the same tick-to-tick transparency in\n\nindividual accounts. Hedging would still be available to cater to individual risk\n\nChapter 8 Banks, Money and Macroeconomics 2/8/16 9\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_011098\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

But, if the corporate rate is also\nlowered significantly, it could potentially make sense to go to a C-corp.\n\n¢ — Bill sees infrastructure as a real growth area for KKR. 7-8 years ago it was difficult\nto raise an infrastructure fund as the asset class didn’t do very well in the financial\ncrisis; today there is more interest. KKR’s first infrastructure fund was around $1B\nand the second one was around $38. Infrastructure needs are tremendous long-\nterm, with $1-2 trillion capital needed for projects over the next decade, and\ninfrastructure spend is one area of consistency across the two major parties.\n\n« Management thinks that investors understand the reason for the change in the\ndistribution policy.

A lawsuit that Michael Stroll, the former head of Williams Electronics Inc., filed\nagainst Epstein shows that in 1982 I.A.G. received an investment from Stroll of $450,000, which\nEpstein put into oil. In 1984 Stroll asked for his money back; four years later he had received\nonly $10,000. Stroll lost the suit, after Epstein claimed in court, among other things, that the\ncheck for $10,000 was for a horse he’d bought from Stroll. “My net worth never exceeded four\nand a half million dollars,” Stroll has said.\n\nHoffenberg, says a close friend, “really liked Jeffrey.... Jeffrey has a way of getting under your\nskin, and he was under Hoffenberg’s.” Also appealing to Hoffenberg were Epstein’s social\nconnections; they included oil mogul Cece Wang (father of the designer Vera) and Mohan\nMurjani, whose clothing company grew into Gloria Vanderbilt Jeans. Epstein lived large even\nthen. One friend recalls that when he took Canadian heiress Wendy Belzberg on a date he hired a\nRolls-Royce especially for the occasion. (Epstein has claimed he owned it.)\n\nIn 1987, Hoffenberg, according to sources, set Epstein up in the offices he still occupies in the\nVillard House, on Madison Avenue, across a courtyard from the restaurant Le Cirque.\nHoffenberg hired his new protégé as a consultant at $25,000 a month, and the relationship\nflourished. “They traveled everywhere together—on Hoffenberg’s plane, all around the world,\nthey were always together,” says a source. Hoffenberg has claimed that Epstein confided in him,\nsaying, for example, that he had left Bear Stearns in 1981 after he was discovered executing\n“illegal operations.”\n\nSeveral of Epstein’s Bear Stearns contemporaries recall that Epstein left the company very\nsuddenly. Within the company there were rumors also that he was involved in a technical\ninfringement, and it was thought that the executive committee asked that he resign after his two\nsupporters, Ace Greenberg and Jimmy Cayne, were outnumbered. Greenberg says he can’t recall\nthis; Cayne denies it happened, and Epstein has denied it as well. “Jeffrey Epstein left Bear\nStearns of his own volition,” says Cayne. “It was never suggested that he leave by any member\nof management, and management never looked into any improprieties by him. Jeffrey said\nspecifically, ‘I don’t want to work for anybody else. I want to work for myself.’” Yet, this is not\nthe story that Epstein told to the S.E.C. in 1981 and to lawyers in a 1989 deposition involving a\ncivil business case in Philadelphia.\n\nIn 1981 the S.E.C.’s Jonathan Harris and Robert Blackburn took Epstein’s testimony and that of\nother Bear Stearns employees in part of what became a protracted case about insider trading\naround a tender offer placed on March 11, 1981, by the Seagram Company Ltd. for St. Joe\nMinerals Corp. Ultimately several Italian and Swiss investors were found guilty, including\nItalian financier Giuseppe Tome, who had used his relationship with Seagram owner Edgar\nBronfman Sr. to obtain information about the tender offer.\n\nAfter the tender offer was announced, the S.E.C. began investigating trades involving St. Joe at\nBear Stearns and other firms. Epstein resigned from Bear Stearns on March 12. The S.E.C. was\ntipped off that Epstein had information on insider trading at Bear Stearns, and it was therefore\nobliged to question him. In his S.E.C. testimony, given on April 1, 1981, Epstein claimed that he\nhad found “offensive” the way Bear Stearns management had handled a disciplinary action\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_017778\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

Noting that labor trafficking,\nwhich the Labor Department combats, is often conjoined with sex trafficking, Nance says\nthat President Trump would not have nominated Acosta if reports fully describing Acosta’s\nconduct in the Epstein case had emerged earlier.\n\nSen. Ben Sasse has also weighed in. He sent a letter to the Justice Department asking it to\ninvestigate its treatment of Epstein, including the fact that the plea deal ensured that victims\nof the pervert would be denied the ability to comment on or object to the leniency of his\nsentence. Sasse is chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee Subcommittee on Oversight,\nAgency Action, Federal Rights and Federal Courts.\n\nSen. Marco Rubio, a longtime supporter of Acosta, says it would be “very troubling” if\npolitical influence led to a light sentence for Epstein. In Rubio’s view, and that of every\nrational person, Epstein “should have been in jail for a long time.” Rubio added, however,\nthat he will reserve judgment until he hears Acosta’s side.\n\nThat’s fair. But so far, Acosta has provided no real defense for letting Epstein off so lightly.\nIn public, at least, he is standing by his argument that the deal was a reasonable one and that\nthis is old news.\n\nPreviously, Acosta had a different defense. He cited “a year-long assault on the prosecution\nand the prosecutors” by “an army of legal superstars” who represented Epstein. This\nallegedly included “defense counsel investigat[ing] individual prosecutors and their\nfamilies, looking for personal peccadilloes that may provide a basis for disqualification.” In\nthis account, the deal was made to relieve the pressure, while still getting a conviction.\n\nAcosta could hardly assert this explanation — 1.e., that he wimped out — while seeking a\ncabinet position with the expectation of being appointed to more exalted jobs in the future.\nNor is the explanation particularly plausible. Acosta isn’t the first prosecutor to face a\nscorched earth defense. Ask Ken Starr about this.\n\nI don’t doubt that Acosta regarded escaping the wrath of the defense team as a benefit of\nreaching the plea deal. But I don’t believe this was incentive enough to cause him, in effect,\nto throw the case.\n\nWhat was the true incentive? As I wrote when this story broke, I think it was the same\nincentive that explains much of his conduct in public life — Acosta’s desire to\naccommodate people he thinks can help him down the road.\n\nWhich people? Probably the lawyers at Kirkland and Ellis, where Acosta had once worked.\n\nEpstein enlisted Ken Starr* and Jay Lefkowitz, both of Kirkland, for his defense team.\nAcosta reportedly worked out the terms of his surrender with Lefkowitz, a former\ncolleague, at a meeting in a location far away from the prosecutor’s office.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_030963\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

Anthropomorphism has\nbeen a hotly debated feature of religion\nsince classical antiquity. But, in the\nmodern world, religious\nanthropomorphism has become\nespecially controversial, while, at the\nsame time, also becoming a crucial\nconcept in modern theories about the\nvery nature of religion.” Modern\nobjections to anthropomorphism have\ntaken two major forms. First, traditions\nwithin Judaism, Christianity, and Islam\nhave long opposed the worship of\n“idols,” and regarded anthropomorphism\nas a dangerous assault against genuine\npiety and properly theological\nunderstanding of existence. In the\nmodern period these religious objections\nagainst anthropomorphism have\neventuated not only in sophisticated\nintellectual polemics against\nanthropomorphic concepts of God but\nalso in popular movements of\niconoclasm, which protested against\nanthropomorphic representations of the\ndivine and sometimes physically\ndestroyed anthropomorphic images.\nSecond, the rise and development of\nmodern science has emphasized the\nregularity of the processes that structure\nthe natural world. And even when these\norderly processes were described as\nnatural “laws”—a term with obvious\nanthropomorphic connotations—they\nhave generally been understood in ways\nthat are thoroughly impersonal and\nlacking any intrinsic purpose or design.\nHence, modern science has generated\nnumerous questions about religious\n\n103\n\nPage\n\ninterpretations of influence on the course\nof nature by divine ideas and purposes.\nSince the late nineteenth century, many\ninstances of the so-called “warfare”\nbetween science and theology have\nturned on the issue of whether any\nscientific plausibility could be attached\nto concepts of a divine mind, purpose, or\nintention that guided or ordered the\nstructure of the universe.\" According to\nthe philosopher Charles Taylor, the\ntransition from perceptions of a divinely\nordered, purposive universe to an\n“impersonal order” of nature marked a\npivotal change that, especially since the\neighteenth century, has shaped “a secular\nage” among the societies of the modern\nWest.” In short, anthropomorphism has\nnot only become a source of tension\nwithin religions but also something of an\nimpasse between religious and scientific\ninterpretations of the universe.\nNonetheless, anthropomorphic\nassumptions remain vigorously present\nin many of the modern forms of\ntheology, spiritual practice, and religious\nart, a persistence that suggests the\nstrength of the psychological and social\nfunctions performed by\nanthropomorphic representation.\n\nIn light of these longstanding\ncontroversies about religious\nanthropomorphism, the graphically\nanthropomorphic, spider-dangling deity\nof Edwards’s sermon would seem to\noffer a good test case for understanding\nhow anthropomorphic religious language\nworks in the modern era. Such an\nunderstanding begins with one of the\ncentral themes of this book, namely, the\npowerful human motivation to establish\nand maintain social connections.\nAnthropomorphism extends this drive\nfor social connection beyond the\nboundaries of human societies by\nattributing human characteristics to\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_021349\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

There’s a meteor shower, and most people go outside to look at it. The next morning,\neveryone who looked at the meteor shower ends up blind, and Earth is taken over by giant man-eating venomous plants. The\npoint: some amazing events which look benign have unforeseen consequences. Will a pact of going for growth pay the\nfreight of higher Federal debt in the long run? Hard to say; there are not a lot of examples to draw from. Economic theories and\ntheir associated debt bubbles don’t always work out as planned’. After WWII, the US also faced a debt ratio of 80% of GDP.\nAusterity was not the answer back then; government receipts and outlays as a % of GDP did not change much during the 1950’s,\nand net debt was flat. So how did US debt/GDP fall from 80% to 46% in just ten years? Robust annualized real growth of\nmore than 4.0%, and 2.0% inflation. However, unique economic conditions and productivity gains of the 1950’s (e.g., interstate\nhighway, rebuilding of Europe and Japan) may not be repeated, and the country was not headed into an entitlement time bomb.\nIf the US does not experience a growth/productivity boom, the burden of higher debt could last for a generation or more. A pro-\ngrowth Administration would probably help, but the difficulty lay in defining exactly what that means.\n\nIsn’t it amazing? 1950’s debt reduction was based on growth, not austerity\n\nNet debt |Net debt] Nominal]|Real GDP (bn|Outlays (%] Receipts (%\n\n80% 16% 14%\n67% = = — 14% 16%\n62% $215 $349 $322 19% 19%\n59% $218 $373 $341 21% 19%\n60% $224 $377 $343 19% 19%\n57% $227 $396 $354 17% 17%\n52% $222 $427 $368 17% 18%\n49% $219 $451 $377 17% 18%\n49% $226 $460 $377 18% 17%\n48% $235 $490 $398 19% 16%\n\n46% $237 $519 $415 18% 18%\n\nComp. ann'l gr: 0.8% 6.6% 4.3%\n\nSource: OMB, BEA.\n\nAre there debt vs austerity parallels at the state and local level?\n\nYes and no.

Even these “as-reported” estimates, which come\nfrom the states, may be underestimated.

They aim to make it weird, to manipulate it madly from\nthe inside out. Network power doesn’t merely come from that 10 million device-per-\nday spread of global connectivity, after all, it also comes from incredible\nconcentration of power inside certain systems we all rely on: Chips, data bases,\ncentralized and gatekept platforms. Control of such hubs and roots of our world can\ninfluence everything; little wonder they are such an appealing target. “The\nconventional belief that all nuclear systems are ‘air gapped’ is a myth,” the Russian\nsecurity researcher Eugene Kaspersky has warned. The result: “There are three\ntypes of people: Scared to death. Opportunists. Don’t care.”151\n\nThis sense that the systems are so vulnerable if you can get to their hearts is what\nlures hackers ever deeper, into the code kernels where the most basic instructions\nare decided. That they can often make machines weird by using the device’s own\ncode against them, like some sort of autoimmune disease, is only a marker of the\nparticular perversity of the problem here. Security researchers call such holes\n“vulnerabilities” in a system, but of course they are much more than weak spots.\nThey are potentially fatal. In a way, the hot rush to touch and tickle and maliciously\nuse these already waiting cancers reveals to us the essential Seventh Sense secret of\nthe Warez Dudes: Connection makes an object vulnerable, yes; but it can also reveal\nthe possibility of total control, of the fundamental root mastery of a connected\nsystem. Such a hole, when it is exposed by connection and then corruption, can be\ncomplete in the scope of its damage, devastating. Lord Acton’s famous line that\n“Absolute power corrupts absolutely,” twists in this age to something like “Absolute\naccess corrupts absolutely.” Connection makes total exploitation, total control,\npossible.\n\nEvery new generation of connected technologies is breeding essential black boxes,\ncomplex (not merely complicated!) containers filled with algorithmic levers and\ncode tools for digital work that can be understood by only a few people, and\nexploited and used effectively — for good or ill - by a still smaller group. “The greater\nthe dependence on a technology the greater the need to study and expose its inner\nworkings,” one group of radical digital activists has argued in The Critical\nEngineering Manifesto. 52 They mean that as we turn our safety, freedom, and health\nover to a world of devices and their makers, we must know what goes on inside the\nvery heart of such systems.

Attributing\nhuman-like ideas and emotions to the\ncomprehending powers of the universe not only\nseems out of step with modern science but also a\npresumptuous confinement of the world within\nmerely human needs and capacities. Yet, the\nimpulse to speak anthropomorphically about our\n“ultimate environment” has vigorously persisted\ninto the modern age.

From his scriptural\ntext—“‘their foot shall slide in due time”\n(Deut. 32: 35)—Edwards drew the\ndoctrine that “there is nothing that keeps\nwicked men, at any one moment, out of\nhell, but the mere pleasure of God.”\nSinners living here and now, Edwards\ndeclared, were “the objects of that very\nsame anger and wrath of God, that is\nexpressed in the torments of hell,” and\nthat wrath was an annihilating fire that\nalready “burns against them; their\ndamnation does not slumber; the pit is\nprepared; the fire is made ready...to\nreceive them.” In a notorious image,\nEdwards portrayed God dangling the\nsinner’s soul over the fires of hell like a\nspider on a single, slender filament of its\nweb. The sermon achieved stunning\nresults, as recorded in the diary of one of\nthose present, Stephen Williams:\n\n“before the sermon was done, there was\na great moaning and crying out\nthroughout the whole house—what shall\nI do to be saved; oh, I am going to hell;\noh, what shall I do for a Christ.” The\n“shrieks and cries were piercing and\namazing,” Williams reported, and the\nscene was so tumultuous that Edwards _\nhad to stop before finishing his sermon.’\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_021348\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

So, when I saw the other side of Svet, performing her \nown brand of magic in fundraisers and other high end charitable events and \norganizations, I realized what an amazingly talented public relations and \nfundraising expert she is, and I was not surprised the least. \nWhen it comes to organizing events, finding A-list funders for her \ncauses, in my opinion, is at the top of her game and is a true magician — \nthe success stories she pulled for the children on the US Virgin Islands, the \nIvory Coast, and many others are true miracles.

Announced reforms can help sustain higher potential growth if fully realized as\nnew sectoral sources of growth are developed. Positively, the NTP borrows elements\nfrom other successful strategic case studies. Still, we find a number of targets\nambitious or unrealistic on the fiscal and diversification fronts, and the sequencing and\ndetails of the fiscal measures are left nebulous.\n\nIn terms of the other pillars of the macro view, namely energy and Fx policy, the NTP\npresents a mixed picture, in our view. Energy policy is likely to be less aggressive, as the\nNTP suggests a constant oil production capacity. To remain consistent with the targeted\ngovernment debt accumulation path, we estimate that oil prices have to average at least\nUS$50/bbI in 2016-20 along with no growth in spending (excluding the additional cost\nof NTP initiatives). Partial implementation could require oil prices of cUS$65/bbl.\n\nFiscal consolidation remains imperative to support the Fx peg, in line with stability and\neconomic imperatives. However, as diversification progresses, the case for increased Fx\nflexibility to support competitiveness could likely gradually take shape. Policy-making\ngrowth-focused plans may conflict with needs to deflate Fx demand in the economy.\n\nTowards better governance\n\nThe comprehensive economic blueprint unveiled by the Saudi Vision 2030 and the\nNational Transformation Plan (NTP) confirms the economic reform credentials of the\ncurrent administration. It is likely to improve government culture, accountability and\ntransparency, in our view. The NTP will be implemented across 24 government bodies\nand has been presented through a number of press conferences with high-level\nministerial presentations. The Governance Framework details steps to institutionalize\nand coordinate implementation through restructuring the government. It proposes a\nnumber of committees and bodies to report to the Council for Economic and\nDevelopment Affairs (CEDA). It also introduces an escalation mechanism to rapidly\nresolve bottlenecks, which could see matters escalated to CEDA in 42 days.\n\nA wide-ranging policy-making reshuffle\n\nIn line with ongoing Saudi Vision 2030 implementation efforts, a wide-ranging\nrestructuring of the Saudi Cabinet and government bodies was announced in May to\ndrive change in the government. King Salman issued 51 Royal Decrees restructuring the\nCabinet, various government bodies and appointing a number of officials into various\ngovernment roles. A statement concurrently issued by the Royal Court suggested these\nchanges are in line with the recently announced Saudi Vision 2030 and aim to support\nits implementation. This follows from the January 2015 restructuring of the bodies\naffiliated to the Council of Ministers, which saw the creation of CEDA and the Council\nfor Political and Security Affairs. We list a few major changes below.\n\nNew Oil Minister represents technocratic experience and policy continuity\n\nThe appointment of Khalid Al-Falih to the Ministry of Energy, Industry and Mineral\nResources is not surprising, given that former Minister of Petroleum and Mineral\nResources Al-Naimi has previously suggested he was approaching retirement due to old\nage. Al-Falih’s appointment continues the tradition of non-Royals heading the Ministry,\nwhile simultaneously holding the Chairmanship role of Saudi Aramco. Furthermore,\naccording to local press, Al-Falih appears close to Deputy Crown Prince Mohamed bin\nSalman, and his appointment likely confirms the recently assertive Royal influence over\nenergy policy, in our view. New Minister of Energy, Industry and Mineral Resources Al-\nFalih’s past official pronouncements are consistent with stable Saudi energy policy, in\nour view.\n\nOS merrill Lynch GEMs Paper #26 | 30 June 2016 3\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_016113\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

The rebuilding of Indonesia. Or New Orleans. Or both. Go there. I've just been. \nYou will never think the same way about anything again.\" \nSo spoke not Bill or Melinda Gates, but Ghislaine Maxwell, the 48-year-old woman being written up \neverywhere at the moment as the alleged \"procurer\" of young women for billionaire Jeffrey Epstein. \nEpstein, 57, is the financier who spent a year in jail on charges of soliciting prostitutes—and now there is talk of \nanother investigation because various women, now in their twenties and thirties, have come forward with \nallegations that he molested them when they were under-age. The allegations first surfaced in British \nnewspapers, which have zeroed in on Epstein's friendship with Prince Andrew, who has recently tried to \npublicly disassociate himself from his old pal. \nI wrote a piece for Vanity Fair in 2003 called \"The Talented Mr. Epstein.\" It was largely a business piece that \nfocused on his mysterious exit from Bear Steams in 1981, his close relationships with Jimmy Cayne, Les \nWexner, the chairman of Limited Brands, and above all, the man who claimed to be his mentor, Steven Jude \nHoffenberg, who is currently serving a 20-year-jail sentence for bilking investors in Towers Financial out of \n$450 million. \nThe piece alluded to Epstein's great friendship with Maxwell, and how she introduced him to young women \nwith whom he had sexual relationships. But, in the end, the story didn't really go there, focusing instead on the \nissue that remains a mystery—how Jeffrey made his money, and how Ghislaine made hers. \nThis is not to say I didn't hear stories about the girls. I did. But, not knowing quite who to believe, I \nconcentrated on the intriguing financial mystery instead. But now the women have come back. Not the same \nones, different ones. And their stories are bone-chilling. Journalists from England have phoned—and, in one \ncase, flown—to ask me about Epstein and Maxwell. Who is he? And the British, especially, want to know: \nWho is she? At this point, I am so bored of repeating myself to others—it was, after all, my 2003 Vanity \nFairstory that really brought him into the limelight—that I have decided to write about this myself \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 030414 \nBizarrely, perhaps, I have gotten to know Jeffrey and Ghislaine far better after my piece than before it. I kept \nrunning into both of them, separately, at parties. Jeffrey is not a social animal so he usually has a couple of \nyoung women with him who stand two feet behind him, as if serving a monarch. \"Do they speak?\" I remember \nasking him once, nodding at his lookalike blondes. He laughed. \"Not like you,Vicky,\" was his riposte. \nI remembered that when we'd once discussed math—in particular, an isosceles triangle—and I revealed I \nhadn't studied math since I was 14 (such is, or was, the way of the British educational system), I received a \npackage at home via messenger. It was a book: \"Math for idiots.\" \nSo he is not without humor, even though he doesn't drink or smoke, and hates restaurants. \n\"Jeffrey knows a good deal about most subjects,\" newspaper publisher Mort Zuckerman told me last week. He \nwas certainly preaching to the converted. The truth is, Epstein does know a lot about a lot of things. Just a few \nmoments in his company and you know this to be true. \nWhen I saw pictures of Prince Andrew walking in Central Park with Jeffrey, my immediate thought was that \n\"Andy\"—as Jeffrey calls him—is probably asking for help with his role as British trade envoy, or whatever his \nstrange title is. Because if one thing's for sure: When it comes to international business, Jeffrey knows what \nhe's talking about far more than \"Andy\" does. Which is why Leon Black, Mort Zuckerman and a few other \nfinanciers hang out with him. \nAnd Ghislaine? \nFull disclosure: I like her. Most people in New York do. It's almost impossible not to. \nShe is always the most interesting, the most vivacious, the most unusual person in any room. I've spent hours \ntalking to her about the third world at a bar until 2am. She is as passionate as she is knowledgeable. She is \ncurious. She has spent weeks at the bottom of the ocean, literally going deeper than anyone else. She has sent \nme a DVD of the fish there. Her rolodex would blow away almost anyone else's I can think of—probably even \nRupert Murdochs'. She is very well-read and can talk about most things for hours. She is passionate about Bill \nClinton with whom she is close friends. \nYet, touchingly, when she had to give a speech at the 40th birthday party of her best friend, Ariadne Calvo-\nPlatero, (known fondly to her close friends as \"the Tennis Goddess\") Ghislaine shook a little with nerves. When \nit comes down to things she really cares about—and Ariadne is one of them—Ghislaine shows her \nvulnerability. \nAnd that vulnerability is key to understanding her friendship with Jeffrey. \n\"He saved her,\" I remember a close friend of mine telling me. \"When her father died, she was a wreck; \ninconsolable. And then Jeffrey took her in. She's never forgotten that—and never will.\" \nIn many ways, the socially awkward Epstein with his big house, plane, island and ranch was the perfect \nreplacement for her father, the late Robert Maxwell, newspaper tycoon and criminal. Sure, Jeffrey had his \nsexual pecadillos, but then Ghislaine's father was not without his oddities. After all, it was he who died leaving \na massive \"black hole\" he'd fraudulently created. To Ghislaine, Jeffrey's habits may not have seemed that \nstrange. \nIn fact, she probably figured, rather like I have, after years of writing about he very rich, that most successful \npeople in the end either have some weird habit (the late Bruce Wasserstein had the weight issues, the girl issues, \nand moved countries to avoid paying tax), or they break the law (Sam Waksal, Martha Stewart.) You don't \ntend to get to the top by being the world's most balanced human being. Even the folksy Warren Buffett didn't \nquite manage a normal life—whatever that is. He had a second \"wife\" for many years whose existence he has \nbeen open about. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 030415 \nSo what to make of the current fuss over Ghislaine? I haven't spoken to her or to Jeffrey, but I suspect that her \nloyalty to friends like Bill Clinton will keep her in good stead, in the end, she'll be out and about as always. \nLook at Waksal and Stewart. No one sees them and thinks: criminal. Au contraire. In this city, money makes up \nfor all sorts of blemishes. \n- \n*********************************************************** \nThe information contained in this communication is \nconfidential, may be attorney-client privileged, may \nconstitute inside information, and is intended only for \nthe use of the addressee.

Using\nmachine learning the techniques for vulnerability detection are increasingly sophisticated but opaque.\n\nAt some point adaptive cyber defense/offense systems become scalable so they can take over\nvulnerable systems.

But without a decisive\nway of cleaning systems the problem will be persistent until entirely new secure infrastructure can be\nbuilt at a great cost.\n\nHUMAN DIMENSION OF CYBERSECURITY: Al FOR SOCIAL ENGINEERING\n\nBeyond direct effects on computing systems, rising concerns include the use of Al methods for social\nengineering to gain access to system authentication information. For example, recent work\ndemonstrated the use of an iterative machine learning and optimization loop for spear phishing on\nTwitter. There are concerns with Al leveraging one of the weakest links in cybersecurity: people and\ntheir actions.\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nWhat are key threats ahead and how might they be addressed with new designs? How might we\nthwart the risk of Al for guiding “social engineering” of attacks and release of information? What are\nconcrete proposals for best practices for thwarting Al for cyberattacks, including highlighting of areas\nwhere more research is needed?\n\nREFERENCES\nSinger and Friedman. 2014.

The man who many \nsee as responsible for the democratisation of computing and who is the biggest activist philanthropist across the globe is \nhighly regarded everywhere. \nIn his home, America, he ranks only 5th, behind Pope Francis, President Obama, Billy Graham, and George W. Bush. Mr \nObama and the Pope have a strong lead in Western nations but Mr Gates is highly regarded in every country polled, from \nBrazil to Egypt, Nigeria to Indonesia, Britain to Russia to Australia. He tops the poll in China — as respondents there said: \"He \ngot into a good university, but gave up studying to start his business. He has become a rich man despite dropping out of school \n... He has a successful career and a caring heart — he is ordinary, but great.\" \nThe Queen came highest in Britain and second in Australia, but didn't make the Indian top ten. Nevertheless she is the most \nadmired woman in the world, in 17th place, closely followed by Angelina Jolie and Oprah Winfrey. \nHalf of the top ten admired in Russia are women, including the pop singer Alla Pugacheva and the Queen. That is the highest \nfigure in all countries surveyed — women are strikingly under-represented. \nSome light is shed on this by comparing our results with a recent Gallup poll in America, which asked for most admired man \nand woman in separate questions. In that poll, Bill Clinton scored 2 per cent and Hillary Clinton 15. YouGov asked a single \nquestion, not differentiating men and women, and the two Clintons rated about the same. The two polls also show the power of \nthe media to direct public attention: Gallup polled early in December, and Pope Francis was \"most admired\" by only 4 per cent. \nBy the time of the YouGov survey, Time magazine had made him its Person of the Year, and he shot up to 21 per cent. \nBusiness leaders did well in general. YouGov puts Sir Richard Branson 4th in Britain, the Hong Kong billionaire Sir Li Kashing \nwas sixth in China; the Nigerian industrialist Aliko Dangote was third in his home country; Silvio Santos, a media billionaire, \nwas 4th in Brazil; Mikhail Khodorkovsky, the tycoon recently freed by Vladimir Putin, was 8th in Russia; while Warren Buffett, \nwho is admired in India, Pakistan and China, was 8th in the world. \nActors and musicians do less well. With the exception of the Bollywood superstar Amitabh Bachchan, Ms Jolie and Stephen \nFry, who confirms his enormous Twitter following by making 7th in Britain, just below Desmond Tutu. Johnny Depp and Brad \nPitt get close to the top in a couple of countries and Justin Bieber did well in Indonesia, but the rock star and anti-poverty \ncampaigner Bono is notable by his absence. \nSportsmen were more highly regarded, with the Indian cricketer Sachin Tendulkar 5th in the world — but only because he is so \nadored in the world's second-most populous country. The footballer Lionel Messi had broader support, reaching 15th in the \nworld. In Britain, David Beckham squeaked into 10th place. \nIn only two countries of the 13 surveyed did no local politician make it into the top ten —Australia and the UK. The omission \nwas most striking in Britain where Nigel Farage, the top politician, was in 16th place. David Cameron received the \"most \nadmired\" accolade from only two people in a thousand. In Germany, Angela Merkel scored 65 times higher at 13 per cent, \nsecond only to the Pope. Vladimir Putin topped the Russian poll with a whopping 24 per cent, Nicolas Sarkozy was third in \nFrance and Goodluck Jonathan 8th in Nigeria. Edward Snowden, responsible for leaking classified documents that revealed \nthe extent of surveillance by America's National Security Agency, was 10th most admired in the country that granted him \nasylum, Russia. He also showed strongly in Germany. We also asked who was the most famous person in the world. The \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 028529 \noverwhelming choice was Mr Obama, with 26 per cent, and Mr Gates behind on 12. \nYouGov polled in Great Britain, France, Germany, Russia, the US, Australia, Pakistan, Indonesia, India, China, Egypt, Nigeria \nand Brazil, representing over half of the world's population and the most populated country on each continent, and spoke to \ntotal of 13,895 people around the world. We used a mix of internet and mobile phone surveys. In most countries we achieved \nrepresentative samples but in some we were unable to achieve good representation of rural communities. Our survey asked \ntwo open-ended questions, seeking write-in answers: who do you think is the most famous person in the world, and who do \nyou personally most admire? \nAlthough we specified that only living people should be considered, many wanted to choose Nelson Mandela anyway, and had \nwe conducted the survey a month earlier he would have come top. In China there was significant support for Mao Zedong, \nZhou Enlai and Deng Xiaoping, with 14 per cent between them, and had those respondents considered only the living, Xi \nJinping would have scored even more highly. \nWho's Who \n- Narendra Modi, an Indian politician, is the prime ministerial candidate of the BJP, the main opposition party. \n- Amitabh Bachchan is a Bollywood superstar, who was the \"angry young man\" of Hindi cinema. \n- Abdul Kalam is an Indian scientist and was president of his country 2002-07. \n- Anna Hazare held a series of hunger strikes in India in a successful campaign for anti-corruption laws. \n- Arvind Kejriwal is the Chief Minister of Delhi, and worked alongside Hazare. \n- Peng Liyuan, a Chinese folk singer, is the wife of President Xi Jingping. \n- The philanthropist Abdul Sattar Edhi founded the Edhi Foundation, the largest welfare organisation in Pakistan. \n- Joko 'Jokowi' Widodo, the governor of Jakarta, is a populist leader who may run in the 2014 Indonesian presidential election. \nStephan Shakespeare is CEO of YouGov. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 028530 \n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

But it appears his problems may not be over. Now The Daily Beast has learned\nthat:\n\n* Federal investigators continue to investigate Epstein’s activities, to see whether there is\nevidence of child trafficking—a far more serious charge than the two in his non-\nprosecution agreement, the arrangement between Epstein and the Department of Justice\nallowing him to plead guilty to lower-level state crimes. Trafficking can carry a 20-year\nsentence.\n\n° The FBI is also investigating Epstein’s friend Jean Luc Brunel, whose MC2 modeling\nagency appears to have been a source of girls from overseas who ended up on Epstein’s\nprivate jets.\n\nBecause Epstein’s predatory habits stretch back many years and involved dozens of young-\nlooking girls, there may well be more evidence to uncover.\n\nUnder the concept of double jeopardy, Epstein can no longer be prosecuted for any of the\ncharges covered by his non-prosecution agreement, in which he agreed to serve a short term of\nincarceration, fund the civil suits of named victims, and register as a sex offender, The victims\nwho accepted cash settlements in these civil suits agreed not to testify against him or speak\npublicly about the case. However, new evidence developed by the Department of Justice on other\noffenses not covered by the agreement, including allegations by additional victims who come\nforward, could lead to new charges. There is no statute of limitations in the federal sex-\ntrafficking law, which was also enacted by the state of Florida in 2002. Because his predatory\nhabits stretch back many years and involved dozens of young-looking girls, there may well be\nmore evidence to uncover. (Several young women who claim to be Epstein victims have recently\ncontacted a Ft. Lauderdale lawyer, but to date no new civil complaints have been filed.)\n\n* Conchita Sarnoff: The Billionaire Pedphile's Sex Den\n\n* Billionaire Pedophile Goes Free\n\nThese new developments come one week after the publication of two articles in The Daily Beast\nabout Epstein’s pattern of sexual contact with underage girls, which Palm Beach police began\ninvestigating in 2005 and the U.S. Attomey’s office then settled in a 2007 plea deal.

You ordered a cheese plate, and later champagne,\ndespite her suggestion that you go down to dinner.\n\n° You then made a comment about her eye makeup, getting very close to her face.\n\n° You then lifted her by her arms, and pushed her onto the bed beneath you, forcibly kissing her and\ntrying to pull down the crotch of her tights.\n\n° She struggled to push you off her.\n\n° You said, “When | was in college | could never get a girl that looked like you.”\n\n° When you pulled out a condom, she got out from under you. She said “I have to go,” and rushed out of\nthe room.\n\nIncident 2:\n\n° In an incident that occurred in fall of 2007 while you were a physics professor at Case Western Reserve\n\nUniversity, a student tried to talk to you about her plans after graduation. You mentioned to her how tough it\nmust be to have all the other physics majors asking her out on dates.\n\n° In a second incident in December of 2007, while you were still at Case Western, the same student\nvisited your office to interview you for a student science journal. You closed the door behind her, and ignored\nthe questions she had prepared. Then you made a casual comment about taking her out for dinner.\n\n° Later, in a regular column for the school paper, she described her experiences with you, without\nmentioning you by name. “There was even one particular creep of a professor who once told me he thought\ndifferently of me compared to other students and asked me to dinner: a situation so disturbing that it left me\nupset for weeks afterward,” she wrote.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_021412\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

Rev. 835, *897\n\nCongress was taking an expansive view of the victim's right to be heard at sentencing, including a view that [*898] would\n262\n\nembrace a victim's right to make a specific sentencing recommendation.\nMost important, the Practitioners’ Group's letter fails to consider the impact of denying the victim access to the presentence\nreport on the victim's right to fairness. Presumably the Group, comprised primarily of defense attorneys, would be outraged if\ndefendants were sentenced without receiving notice about relevant parts of the presentence report, because of the defendant's\ndue process rights. But victims now also have due process rights during sentencing, which make it clear that they should\nreceive the same information.\n\nThe Practitioners' Group raises one concern that can be readily dispelled. The Group wonders whether a victim's right to be\nheard on Guidelines issues implies a general right to appeal a sentence. It would not. The CVRA contains its own specific\nremedial provision, which permits victims to appeal only denials of their rights. 7°? It specifically allows a victim to file a\nmotion \"to re-open ... a sentence\" only for violations of the victim's \"right to be heard.\" 2° Moreover, while victims possess\ndue process protections, due process does not guarantee a right to an appeal. *°° Finally, the Sentencing Reform Act spells out\nthe limited rights of appeal on Guidelines issues available to only the government and the defense. 7° For all these reasons,\nvictims have the right to review relevant parts of the [*899] presentence report and to be heard on Guidelines issues in the trial\ncourt, but if the court properly hears them on the Guidelines issues, victims would not have the right to appeal the sentence the\ncourt ultimately imposes.\n\nBecause victims have a right of access to the presentence report, the question arises of how to provide that access. Nothing in\ncurrent law precludes releasing presentence reports to victims. While /8 U.S.C. 3552 requires disclosure to government and\ndefense counsel, it does not forbid further dissemination. Several federal courts have held that circulation of reports to third\nparties is proper on a showing of particularized need approved by the court. 7°? Some courts! local rules also allow additional\ndistribution with court approval. 768 Victims always have a particularized need for access to the Guidelines calculations and\n\n261 See supra notes 239-44 and accompanying text.\n\n262 The Group cites a 2000 Senate Judiciary Committee Report regarding the Victims' Rights Amendment, which referenced a Tenth Circuit\ndecision restricting the right of victims to present a sentencing recommendation. See Letter from Amy Baron-Evans, supra note 258 (citing S.\nRep. No. 106-254, at 12 (2000) (discussing Robinson v. Maynard, 943 F.2d 1216 (10th Cir. 199]))). By 2003, however, the same passage in\nthe Senate Judiciary Committee Report was changed to remove the citation to that case and instead to cite a leading proponent of expansive\nrights for victims to give judges specific sentencing recommendations:\n\nVictim impact statements concerning the character of the victim and the impact of the crime remain constitutional. See Douglas E. Beloof,\nConstitutional Implications of Crime Victims as Participants, 88 Cornell L. Rev. 282 (2003). The Committee does not intend to alter or\ncomment on laws existing in some States allowing for victim opinion as to the proper sentence.\n\nS. Rep. No. 108-191, at 38 (2003). It is hard to see anything in this history suggesting that Congress wanted victims to be deprived of the\nchance to review presentence reports.\n\n263 18 U.S.C.A. 3771(d)(5) (West 2004 & Supp. 2005).

I got a radio call ordering me to get my\nbattalion ready to move, ASAP. We were attached the other main armored\nforce, along with Arik’s, assigned to lead the crossing. It was under the\ncommand of Avraham “Bren” Adnan, the former overall commander of Israeli\ntank forces. “You’re going north of Tirtur 42,” Bren’s operations officer told\nme.

It talks about the time when The Joy of Sex came out, as well as a similar\ncontemporary feminist book, Our Bodies, Ourselves, and it points out that \"both books\nespoused the (distinctly seventies) notion that sex could be a value-neutral experience, as\nnatural as eating.”\n\n\"Value-neutral\": that's a great way to describe the overall attitude about sex that I\nabsorbed. As if sex were something I could do as an amusing diversion, with anyone, at\nany time, and it would always be fun fun fun! As if there was no need to be overly careful\nor sensitive -- sex was just a game I could play, like a sport -- where the worst that would\nhappen if I screwed up might be a skinned knee.\n\nI wish that there had been an emphasis on how emotions can really matter, when it\ncomes to sex. I wish that there had been acknowledgment of the fact that we can really\nhurt ourselves, and others, when we're cavalier about sex. (Not that we always do -- but\nwe can.) I wish I had understood sooner that sex is not always value-neutral; that\neveryone has all manner of different sexual needs and hangups, anxieties and strong\nemotions. I think maybe there are people out there who can have \"value-neutral\" sex --\nwhere it's totally about physicality and nothing more -- but I am not like that, and I\nsuspect that most people are not.\n\nWhich isn't to say that I think there's anything wrong with people who can have sex that's\n\"value-neutral.\" (And maybe \"value-neutral” is not a great term for it; I worry that I\nsound like I'm judging when I use that term.) I just don't think it's a good model for\neveryone, and yet I think that it has somewhat been promoted as if everyone \"ought to\"\nbe that way.\n\nI think that there are lots of people out there who feel as though the sexual liberation\nmovement \"failed\" or \"betrayed them,\" because they convinced themselves that sex is\nvalue-neutral and then got hurt. You see a lot of assertions along these lines in the\nconservative media -- for instance, here's a quotation from a synopsis of the book\nModern Sex:\n\nThe 1960s sexual revolution made a big promise: if we just let go of our inhibitions, we'll\nbe happy and fulfilled. Yet sexual liberation has made us no happier and, if anything, less\nfulfilled. Why?... sex today is increasingly mechanical and without commitment -- a\ndepartment of plumbing, hygiene, or athletics rather than a private sphere for the\ncreation of human meaning. The result: legions of unhappy adults and confused\nteenagers deprived of their innocence, on their way not to maturity but to\ndisillusionment.... These beautifully written essays -- on subjects ranging from the TV\nshow Sex and the City to teen sex to the eclipse of the manly ideal to the benefits of\nmarriage -- add up to the deepest, most informative appraisal we have of how and why\nthe sexual revolution has failed.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_018462\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

The\nAmerican strategist is very attached to the Freedom Caucus — the extreme right of the US Congress\n— and in 2014 he was at the top of the Cambridge Analytica company, which in 2016 used data\nstolen from Facebook to try to influence the presidential election from which Donald Trump emerged\nvictor. It is not a mystery that for a long time he courts nationalists of the right from East to West.\nAnd he has already met, among others, the Hungarian Orban, the French Marine Le Pen and the\nformer leader of the British separatists Nigel Farage. The latter reappeared, coincidentally, on Friday\nin Pennsylvania, USA, to a fundraiser in favor of the Republican congressman Lou Barletta. Without\nforgetting the Italians of Lega and 5 stars. Of them, he said: \"If it works in Italy, we can import the\nmodel anywhere”.\n\nThe Movement, which for now will count on a staff of 10 people, will be fully operational in 2019.

The pattern has continued as we approach FY2017. For example,\nlocal media have reported that the government is considering offering corporate tax\nbreaks to SMEs that raise wages, in light of more modest wage growth at SMEs.\nDiscussions are also underway in the Prime Minister's office about reforming working\npractices with the immediate focus on “Equal Pay for Equal work (EPEW)”—i.e. reducing\nthe wage gap between regular and non-regular employees.\n\nBut the issue is contentious from both a capital and labour perspective. And considering\nthe time it will likely take for related legislation to pass in the Diet, we think the lack of\ncompliance mechanisms may mean that the immediate impact of EPEW will be limited.\nInstead, the debate seems to have shifted towards limiting excessive and unproductive\novertime work. This is low-hanging fruit that does not address the issue of Japan’s\nlabour market rigidities, which are at the heart of the problem of suppressed wages and\nweak household spending power.\n\nThat said, there are signs that the government’s patience is wearing thin and that the\nPrime Minister is increasingly leaning towards direct intervention. For example, the\ngovernment has already delivered a minimum wage hike in FY2016 and plans to take the\nnational average up to JPY1,000 by 2020 via yearly hikes of 3%. These policy changes\nshould offer small tailwinds for the recovery in private consumption. We also think the\ndebate over a possible retained earnings tax is unlikely to go away. We are sceptical it\nwill be introduced in this year’s tax reforms.

Is this because the American president has no time to host them in the White House, where he rules, so those all leaders met him in the kingdom?\n I cannot accommodate with this status unless this person was the prince of believers or (Caliph) who has the right and power to gather the rulers of states in whatever place he choose in the Caliphate or any of its palaces. \n\n\n Following the example of Caliphs, the rulers ware not know the reason behind this meeting or its subject. They also were not know the instructions or orders he carried from the far reaches of the Caliphate. In this case they are as like as the public. All information is available that the Caliph not only feels angry with the rulers, but also puts his eyes on the wealth at their hands. During his election campaign, he literally said, “Saudi Arabia is just like 'a milk cow' and we will slaughter it when its milk runs out”. He may announce increase of the annual attribute provided by every rulers. Also, he may announce administrative redistribution of the states. Moreover, he may spreads his teeth regarding the new rules of the rulers. This may be through involving them in land wars against each other and not against their real enemy, as he is on his way to Israel; and you do not know what Israel is?! \n\n\n The new Caliphate does not hide that he want to empower Israel more and more, to cover from Tel Aviv, Jerusalem, all the Levant, Arabian Island and Persia lands. Therefore, he is going to leave from the lands of Hijaz to the Palestinian occupied lands before leaving to Vatican. He clearly refers to that it is a political tour with religious purposes. It will comes to our ears, all the time, expressions like terrorism, extremism, stiffness, sects, Sunni Islam, Shiite Axis and other expressions that cause more dilemmas and allies in the region. However, the visit is covered by the title of “Mutual Interests”. \n\n\n I wish we would not live this day or witness a status in which the Arab and Islamic leaders run rapidly to a person who does not hide his aggressive feelings towards Arabs and Muslims. At least, I would like to see pre-coordination meetings result in declared demands regarding the region’s cases, headed by the case of ending the Israeli occupation of Arab lands. I hoped to see demands include US non-interference in the affairs of the region, especially in Syria, Iraq, Yemen and Libya. I hoped to see Arabic demands to compensate Iraq for its devastation out of US invasion, compensate Syria for the damages resulted by the US-made ISIS and compensate Yemen and Libya for the bombing and sabotage they face. \n\n\n What is certain is that the Arab people from the ocean to gulf is holding his breath and waiting with great concern what will result from these meetings and the new catastrophes may take place in the region after creative chaos, destructive chaos, endless chaos and the new Middle East. Besides, they ask whether there is anything coherent in the region to be targeted by this suspicious visit, especially that all information confirm imposing new overpriced royalties on specific states. This is through instructions issued directly from the White House. Accordingly, there was no need to visit just to ink more weapon contracts unless the matter is greater than all expectations similar to the deal of century, millennium initiative and other useless contracts of acquiescence. \n\n\n Therefore, we cannot breathe a sigh of relief unless there is transparency from leaders in dealing openly and frankly with their people about all things in the official circles. The people may be surprised in the future with a new “Sykes-Picot Agreement”, other “Balfour Declaration” or even other “1967” and we have lessons in the history of ancestors. The treachery and collusion have been discovered since 1948 until now make us fear everything and doubt in everything especially that there are clear signs in the horizon. \n\n\n \tUnfortunately, the plotters, in Egypt and other Arab countries, will preach and promote to such visit and meetings as the savior of the region of its pests. They will ignore the recent and distance past experiences, depending on the weak Arabic memory. This matter should be warned in the light of Russian-US conflict on the dominance in Syria, Saudi-Iranian conflict on the dominance in Yemen, Sunni-Shiite conflict on the dominance in Iraq and Lebanon, and the Israeli presence in the region. All of these mentioned conflicts are made by the United States. Accordingly, should we depend on Donald Trump or the new prince of believers (Caliph)?! \n\n\n Anyway, I want to remind you that Trump said: “I will get the Gulf states, who are not doing much, believe me. The Gulf states have nothing but money. I’m going to get them to pay. We owe 19 trillion, we’re not paying for it. Don’t forget, without us, the Gulf states won’t exist.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

AY TTA\n\nCentre De Formation Technique Pour\nL’Avancement Des Jeunes Du Sud’Est Inc.\n\nU.S. and Haiti Relationship\n\nLong-term relationships between the U.S. and Haiti have been developed. First of all, the country\nhas a very good geographical location. Port-au-Prince is less than 2 hours by air from Miami\n(approximately 600 miles southeast of the coast of Florida). Moreover, there are flights to New\nYork and Fort Lauderdale. Secondly, English 1s well known in the country. Majority of the Haitian\nbusinesspersons speak English and it is possible to pay for the products in US dollars. Currently,\nthere are some U.S. companies, including commercial banks, telecommunications, airlines, oil and\nagribusiness companies, and U.S.-owned assembly plants are present in Haiti (US Department of\nState, 2010; CIA, 2010).\n\nThe economic situation was largely dependent on the U.S. and entire world’s financial aid. For\nexample, the U.S. contributed more than $850 million of financial aid from 1995 to 2003 to\nimprove governance, security, the rule of law, economic recovery and critical human needs. From\n2004 to 2008, the U.S. provided $600 million of financial aid. Moreover, The World Economic\nForum ranked Haiti last in its 2003 Global Competitiveness Report (Global Security, n.d.; CFI,\n2010). That is why World Bank Donors (U.S., Canada, EU, France, Sweden, Spain, Germany,\nJapan, Switzerland, Greece, Norway, Mexico, and Ireland) provided $1.085 billion from 2004\nthrough 2006 to address humanitarian needs (U.S. Department of State, 2008).\n\nHaiti before the Earthquake in 2010\n\nHaiti had been the least-developed country in the Western Hemisphere since the 1980s. The\neconomic stagnation of the country was a result of inadequate economic policies, political\ninstability, shortage of arable land, environmental deterioration, lack of investment in human\nresources, migration of majority of skilled citizens, weak national savings rata, lack of functioning\njudicial system, corruption, reliance on traditional technologies instead of applying the new ones,\ndrug trafficking, etc. (U.S. Department of State, 2008). A variety of the sources (U.S. Department of\nState, 2000; PRS Group, 2002; World Bank, 2004; Icon Group, 2007; Infomat, 2008; CFI, 2010)\nidentified that Haiti had low trade with the foreign countries between 1990 and 2004 due to the\npolitical instability. Therefore, there were a limited number of foreign investors in Haiti. Later on,\nthe political situation stabilized.\n\nGenerally, Haiti had a positive attitude towards foreign investors. There were no economic or\nindustrial strategies with discriminatory effect, e.g. nationality. The Haitian banking system 1s open\nto the entry and operation of foreign banks. At present, there are two foreign banks operating in\nHaiti: Citibank and Scotia bank (PRS Group, 2002; Investment Overview, 2007).\n\nThe Government of Haiti has made several commitments to the world trade organization in the\nfinancial services sector as follows:\n\ne Allow foreign participation in deposit taking, lending, guarantees and commitments; in\nfinancial leasing; in underwriting services, including participation in the issuance and\nplacement of securities; and in advising and auxiliary services for each of the above-\nmentioned services.\n\nPO Box 666 Brentwood, NY 11717 © Phone (631) 273-4100 © Fax (631) 273-4111 © yair@cefotaj.org © Wwww.cefotaj.org\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_019453\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

The\nbeloved instant classic, The King’s Speech,\nmarches into the arena as the frontrunner, but\npassionate supporters of the edgier (critics’\ndarling) The Social Network have not conceded.\nThe ballots are counted, the party invites are\nout and still the feelings are raw. Nominees are\nexhausted from campaigning.\n\nWoody Allen and George Lucas tell me they\nare no longer members of the Academy\nbecause pitting artists against each other to\ndetermine the quality of their work is insane.\nThey are right. My event and publicity company\nis considered Switzerland by the studios, as\nwe help every filmmaker to present his work.\nHowever, this year, against my better judgment,\nIam somewhat emotionally sucked in.\n\nIn 2005, I met the unknown 32-year-old\nEnglish director Tom Hooper on his first film\nfor HBO, Elizabeth I starring Helen Mirren.\nHelen later wins an Oscar for portraying\nQueen Elizabeth in The Queen. Queen\nElizabeth is the daughter of King George VI,\nportrayed by Oscar-winner Colin Firth in The\nKing’s Speech directed by Hooper. No degrees\nof separation.\n\nAt the Telluride Film Festival, Tom Hooper\nbathed in the glory of a hysterical standing\novation alongside Colin Firth and Geoffrey\nRush at the very first public screening of that\nfilm. Two weeks later at The Toronto Film\nFestival, Harvey Weinstein stood with his\nfilmmakers witnessing the same reaction. The\nfilm won The Audience Prize. Their strategy\nwas to say nothing, do nothing. They have a\npossible Oscar winner—four out of five past\nBest Pictures have premiered in Toronto.\n\nCut to New York City at the end of\nSeptember. It’s opening night at The Film\n\nSociety of Lincoln Center. One of America’s most important\nand prolific producers, Scott Rudin, along with Jesse\nEisenberg, Andrew Garfield and Aaron Sorkin, are in a\nbrightly lit box waving down to their equally hysterical\naudience who have just seen The Social Network. The film\nopens the next day to rave reviews and endless publicity.\nDavid Fincher is off making The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo.\nAaron Sorkin becomes the face of the film and an immediate\nshoo-in for the adapted screenplay Oscar.\n\nThe Hamptons International Film Festival in October\nsuddenly becomes a launching pad for 127 Hours, where\nstar-cum-Yale/NYU student James Franco appears. More\nOscar buzz. Producer/director Danny Boyle (Oscar winner for\nSlumdog Millionaire) stays in London all fall directing the play\nFrankenstein. Black Swan also unspools there in a tiny theater as\nMadonna, Alec Baldwin and Harvey Weinstein slip in the\nback. Darren Aronofsky is hailed a genius. Natalie Portman is\ninstantly the hot nominee for Best Actress. Both films are sen-\nsations, but it’s The King’s Speech that wins The Audience Prize.\n\nMid-November: David O. Russell and Mark Wahlberg\nsneak The Fighter in Manhattan. As their audience erupts in\ncheers, I tell producer/actor Wahlberg, “Clint Eastwood is\ngoing to kill himself for not directing this.” He says, “Youre\nwrong. He turned it down because he’s done it. He’s seen it\nand he loves it.” David O. Russell becomes my new Clint\nEastwood. Christian Bale and Melissa Leo are hailed the\nsupporting actors to beat.\n\nTrue Grit, directed by the Coen Brothers and also produced\nby Scott Rudin, finally throws its cowboy hat in the ring in\nmid-December at the Ziegfeld as the last serious Oscar\ncontender for Best Picture. It gallops off to box office gold.\n\nThe Social Network now cements its battle cry with one\nword: relevance. Mark Zuckerberg lands on the cover of\nTime Magazine as “Person of the Year.” A smart and extensive\nad campaign positions the film in the lead. Critics and\npundits proclaim the race is over. Everyone goes on holiday.\n\nThis is one of the few times in Harvey Weinstein’s life that\nhe’s caught off guard. He quickly mobilizes an inner team of\n15 and conducts strategy meetings 7 days a week, including\nChristmas. They’re like a Chinese restaurant: always open. He\nsends screenwriter David Seidler and Tom Hooper to every\ncorner of the country doing Q&As until they are both blue in\nthe face from “finding their voice.” SAG voters begin seeing\nthe film two and three times.\n\nIn January at the Golden Globes, about 88 foreign journalists\ngive awards to The Social Network for Best Drama, Director\nand Screenplay. The film is still perceived as the Oscar winner\nand nobody can stop the steamroller. Only Academy voters\ndisregard these awards.\n\nThe King’s Speech wins the PGA in L.A. Everyone is totally\nsurprised when Tom Hooper goes on to win the DGA. After\na tremendous amount of hard work by team Weinstein, the\nactors win for the SAG Ensemble.

These findings confirm that our computational method provides an\neffective strategy for rapidly identifying likely victims of censorship given a large pool of possibilities.\n\nIII.10. Epidemics\n\nDisease epidemics have a significant impact on the surrounding culture (Fig. $18 A-C). It was recently\nshown that during seasonal influenza epidemics, users of Google are more likely to engage in influenza-\nrelated searches, and that this signature of influenza epidemics corresponds well with the results of CDC\nsurveillance (Ref S16). We therefore reasoned that culturomic approaches might be used to track\nhistorical epidemics. These could help complement historical medical records, which are often woefully\nincomplete.\n\nWe examined timelines for 4 diseases: influenza (main text), cholera, HIV, and poliomyelitis. In the case\nof influenza, peaks in cultural interest showed excellent correspondence with known historical epidemics\n(the Russian Flu of 1890, leading to 1M deaths, the Spanish Flu of 1918, leading to 20-100M deaths; and\nthe Asian Flu of 1957, leading to 1.5M deaths). Similar results were observed for cholera and HIV.\nHowever, results for polio were mixed. The US epidemic of 1916 is clearly observed, but the 1951-55\nepidemic is harder to pinpoint: the observed peak is much broader, starting in the 30s and ending in the\n60s. This is likely due to increased interest in polio following the election of Franklin Delano Roosevelt in\n1932, as well as the development and deployment of Salk’s polio vaccine in 1952 and Sabin’s oral\nversion in 1962. These confounding factors highlight the challenge of interpreting timelines of cultural\ninterest: interest may increase in response to an epidemic, but it may also respond to a stricken celebrity\nor a famous cure.\n\nThe dates of important historical epidemics were derived from the Cambridge World History of Human\nDiseases (1993) 3\" Edition.\n\nFor cholera, we retained the time periods which most affected the Western world, according to this\nresource:\n\n- 1830-35 (Second Cholera Epidemic)\n\n- 1848-52, and 1854 (Third Cholera Epidemic)\n\n- 1866-74 (Fourth Cholera Epidemic)\n\n- 1883-1887 (Fifth Cholera Epidemic)\n\nThe first, sixth and seventh cholera epidemics appear not to have caused significant casualties in the\nWestern world.\n\n29\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_017037\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

Biological research labs now engage in complex\nDNA analysis with powerful desktop tools (distribution), but to work efficiently,\nthey demand fast reference to the patterns revealed only in immense genetic\ndatasets (concentration).

Bush unanimously\nurged a ban on reproductive cloning. But the panel was deeply divided about the propriety of\n\"therapeutic cloning\" for research and medical treatment.\n\nThough 13 states have passed laws banning reproductive cloning, the United States is one of just\na few industrialized countries that has not prohibited the practice. Seven states also have banned\ntherapeutic cloning. Oregon is not one of them.\n\nThe OHSU team's success underscores the urgent need for federal rules that spell out consistent\nnational limits on therapeutic cloning and put a clear ban on the technology's use in fertility\nclinics, said Johns Hopkins University bioethicist Jeffrey Kahn.\n\nResearchers are also likely to step up their demand for donated eggs so they can conduct similar\nexperiments. That lends urgency to the need for standardized practices for compensating women\nwho donate their eggs. Some states, including California, have set strict limits on such payments,\nwhile others have allowed a market for donated eggs to flourish unregulated, Kahn added.\n\nAmong the methodological innovations outlined in the Cell paper was a trick that stem cell\nscientist Michael D. West, who was not involved in the study, dubbed \"the Starbucks effect.\"\n\nThe OHSU team added caffeine to the growth medium that nourished the eggs after they were\nstripped of their original DNA and awaited the new DNA from a skin cell. Unlike its stimulating\neffect on coffee-drinkers, the caffeine chemically slowed the rush to divide and grow that had\ndoomed earlier efforts.\n\nThe OHSU scientists also studied which batches of donated eggs were most likely to thrive and\nsurvive long enough to produce stem cells. Finding that eggs fared best when they were part of a\nmedium-sized harvest, the researchers fine-tuned their regimen of egg-stimulating drugs so that\nmore of the women produced about 10 eggs per cycle.\n\nIn all, the researchers produced six lines of embryonic stem cells from six separate embryos, said\nOHSU infertility specialist Dr. Paula Amato, one of the paper's authors.\n\nFour of them contained the nuclear DNA of a single donor whose skin cells were purchased from\na commercial lab, and a fifth came from a separate donor whose cells were bought the same way.\n\nThe sixth donor was a patient with Leigh syndrome, a genetic disorder that results in severe and\nmostly fatal neurological degeneration in a child's first years of life.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_027026\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

We highlight three\nreasons why short real rates provides better risk-reward now (Chart 15).\n\n¢ Anti-globalization = higher real rates: Few appreciate that one of the biggest\nbeneficiaries of globalization has been US real rates. Globalization was undoubtedly\ngood for EM growth and reserves. As these reserves found their way back into the\nUS, US real interest rates were held lower. As the global savings glut unwinds, real\nrates have the most room to re-price. Chart 16 offers compelling proof.\n\n« _ Risk parity unwind = higher real rates: Exposure to any heightened concern about\na risk parity deleveraging trade in a high vol environment is best found in asset\nclasses where their footprint is large relative to market liquidity. TIPS is a prime\nexample of one such asset class. The influence of a multi-asset strategy on real\nrates is clear from Chart 17.\n\n- Lower rates = lower breakevens: If the recent euphoria unwinds, it is likely due to\na1) RMB deval; 2} commodity collapse post OPEC; or 3) equity market correction.\n\nChart 15: Real rates vs. breakevens: A real Chart 16: Foreign official holdings of UST vs. Chart 17: BAML multi asset strategy index vs\nshort offers better risk reward than nominal real rates real rates\nshort\n600 -1.25 590 -0.2\n2 0.8\n400 0.75 580 0\n1.8 570 0.2\n0.3 Le\n200 0.25 560 04\n02 0 0.25 550 0.6\n14 -200 - 0.75 540 0.8\n1.2 af 400 1.25 a a\n10 11 12 13 14 15 16 ¢ ® ¢ & ¢ & ¢\n: 12 58282438\nWw wo wo wo co co co ice}\npe ae === 6m change in foreign official holdings of USTs\n—— 5y5y breakevens (LHS) === 6m change in 30y real rates (RHS, inverted == USGGT10Y Index (R1)\n5y5 | rates scale, %4)\nyoy real ra Source: BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research, US Treasury The BAML multi asset strategy index is not representative of all\n\nisk-parity funds.

Controls\n\nTo confirm the quality of our data in the English language, we sought positive controls in the form of\nwords that should exhibit very strong peaks around a date of interest. We used three categories of such\nwords: heads of state (‘President Truman’), treaties (‘Treaty of Versailles’), and geographical name\nchange (‘Byelorussia’ to ‘Belarus’). We used Wikipedia as a primary source of such words, and manually\ncurated the lists as described below. We computed the timeserie of each n-gram, centered it on the date\nof interest (year when the person became president, for instance), and normalized the timeserie by\noverall frequency. Then, we took the mean trajectory for each of the three cohorts, and plotted in Figure\nS5.\n\nThe list of heads of states include all US presidents and British monarchs who gained power in the 19\" or\n20\" centuries (we removed ambiguous names, such as ‘President Roosevelt’). The list of treaties is taken\nfrom the list of 198 treaties signed in the 19\" or 20\" centuries (S7); but we kept only the 121 names that\nreferred to only one known treaty, and that have non zero timeseries. The list of country name changes is\ntaken from Ref S8. The lists are given in APPENDIX.\n\nThe correspondence between the expected and observed presence of peaks was excellent. 42 out of 44\nheads of state had a frequency increase of over 10-fold in the decade after they took office (expected if\nthe year of interest was random: 1). Similarly, 85 out of 92 treaties had a frequency increase of over 10-\nfold in the decade after they were signed (expected: 2). Last, 23 out of 28 new country names became\nmore frequent than the country name they replaced within 3 years of the name change; exceptions\ninclude Kampuchea/Cambodia (the name Cambodia was later reinstated), Iran/Persia (Iran is still today\nreferred to as Persia in many contexts) and Sri Lanka/Ceylon (Ceylon is also a popular tea).\n\nIII.4.

The US, with its priceless collection of bombers and\nmissiles and million-man army, could not strike back for the simple reason that the\nnation’s field officers would have no way to talk to each other, or to commanders in\nWashington. The military radio and telephone systems America depended on for her\nsafety would not likely endure an initial Soviet strike. This was the problem Baran\nhad been told to solve.“At the time we didn’t know how to build a communication\nsystem that could survive even collateral damage by enemy weapons,” he recalled\nlater. RAND determined through computer simulations that the AT&T Long Lines\ntelephone system, a copper web that carried essentially all the nation’s military\ncommunications, would be cut apart by relatively minor physical damage.!°\n\nThe military had spent, already, a fortune on the problem. (They had spent half a\nfortune, it turned out, trying to hide it.) The result was an expensively designed,\ngorgeously featured telephone network linking military bases to strategic command\nposts. But because the lines and their switching centers were laced out in a pattern\nwith just a few big central nodes, like a bicycle wheel with spokes, it had almost no\nchance of surviving the very thing it was designed to help prevent, a Soviet strike. If\nyou gazed at an inked-out map of this network, with its central hub staffed by senior\ncommanders and then radiating lines out to bases and missile silos, it even looked,\nwell, like a target. If the USSR could bullseye those hubs with a bomb or two, the rest\nof the network would fold. The Soviets could do whatever they wanted: Invade\nBerlin, roll into France, obliterate Los Angeles. America’s military would be deaf.\nAnd as Soviet missiles became more accurate, this seemed an inevitability. “We will\nsoon be living in an era,” Baran wrote, “in which we cannot guarantee survivability\nof any single point.”\n\nThe situation, as a carefully screened handful of scientists at RAND knew, was in fact\neven more perilous. Shortly before Baran arrived at RAND, scientists testing\nhydrogen bomb designs in the Pacific discovered that radiation from their\nexplosions fuzzed communications for hundreds of miles. A Soviet attack, even if it\n\n105 “At the time”: There is a fair amount of debate about this question of if the\nInternet design was intended for survivability or if some other systemic need - such\nas linking research institutions - accounted for the distributed architecture that\nemerged. See, for instance, Barry M. Leiner, Vinton G. Cerf, et al, “A Brief History of\nthe Internet”, ACM SIGCOMM Computer Communication Review Volume 39 Issue 5,\nOctober 2009, 22-31. However, an examination of primary source documents shows\nthe evolution of Baran’s thinking clearly and produces documentary evidence for\nthe origins of the problem he and various figures at RAND were aiming to solve.\nOthers arrived at the packet switching model, but it is clear Baran’s path to the\ndesign emerged from the security problems he was considering.

For example:\n\n“Everything in my life right now is\nfocused on trying to get to England, and\nI needed to get some ID pictures. So I\nwas really anxious—the money hasn’t\nreally come together—and one afternoon\nI just felt like God said, you need to get\nup and go get those. Go get those ID\npictures that you need. I was like, that’s\ntotally inefficient. I don’t have a car, so\nit’s like walking half an hour to\nWalgreens and another half an hour\nback. Like, I could do this later and\ncombine it with several things I need to\nget done. But I felt it was a step of faith\nto do this thing. So I did it—grumbling.\nThen on the way there and back I ran\ninto three people I knew, and I felt that\nthere was a kind of pattern, and that I\nwas in the right place at the right time.”\n\nThese ways of recognizing God are\nwidely shared in many forms of\nChristianity. More specific to\nexperiential evangelical Christianity is\nthe expectation that God will speak\ndirectly into the mind, by placing a\nmental image or thought or sensation\nthere. For example:\n\n“T’m praying for someone and, you\nknow, they say their situation, what they\nwant me to pray for. I start praying and\nstart trying to, you know, really\nexperience God, and, you know, I see\nthese vivid images, and I’m explaining\nthese vivid images and what I think they\nmean and, you know, sort of checking in\nwith the person, you know, does this\n\n114\n\nPage\n\nresonate with you? They’re like “oh, my\ngosh, yes! How did you know that?”\n\nMost congregants find this process of\npulling out specific thoughts and\nascribing them to God baffling at first:\nagain, the process violates the basic\nhuman experience that the mind is\nprivate. A congregant commented: “now\nI know that the ‘something’ is God,\nGod’s voice. But I didn’t at all have\nwords to describe it at that time I didn’t\nunderstand. It was very confusing.”\n\nThe social world of the church\ntaught specific ways to differentiate\nbetween mental events that are God and\nthat are not. This technique has been\ntaught in the church since the earliest\ntime as “discernment,” although the\ncontent of the word and its rules has\nvaried with the era. In the modern\nexperiential evangelical church, the rules\nof discernment are more often taught by\nexample and gossip than explicitly.\nNevertheless, there appeared to be four\nprinciples. A thought might be said to\ncome from God if: the thought was\nunexpected; the thought was consonant\nwith God’s nature; the congregant had\nadditional confirmation (one “tested” the\nthought); and one felt peace during the\nexperience. The process was understood\nto be ambiguous, and left room not only\nfor the congregant to be wrong, but for\ndifferent congregants to disagree about\nwhether God had, in fact, spoken in a\nparticular manner. One afternoon, a\nwoman spoke in front of the church\nexplaining that God had spoken to her\nand told her that she should carry out\nsome mission work in a lovely part of\nMexico. The man sitting next to me said\ndrily, “God sure wants a lot of\nevangelizing in Puerto Vallarta.”\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_021360\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

My team once built\na course on negotiation, working with a Harvard Law professor’ who\ntaught negotiation. The course worked by having people negotiate.\nThe situations were artificial so there is some question as to how valu-\nable lessons can be learned from negotiating when nothing important\n(except ego) depends on it. What I found most interesting about that\ncourse were the stories that the expert told from his life as a profes-\nsional negotiator. I can’t say that I was ever able to personally make\nuse of the lessons that those stories taught, but other people’s experi-\nences are interesting to think about. In the end, what we really know\nabout negotiation is what has worked well for us in the course of our\nlives when we were negotiating. Coaching can help, of course, which\nimplies that the best way to teach negotiation would be with a men-\ntor watching you do it for real and offering tips. Psychologists perform\nthis service in couples counseling, and presumably real estate agents\nperform this service for homebuyers and sellers. Just-in-time advice is\nalways helpful.\n\nHOW TO TEACH DESCRIBING\n\nThere is a famous quote: “I apologize that this letter is so long—I\nlacked the time to make it short.”8 As long as people have been talk-\ning, they have had to learn to talk well. When they learned to write,\nthey had to learn to write well. Communication is a very big part of\nliving in a society and those who communicate well gain all kinds of\nadvantages. It is difficult to attain public office without speaking well,\nor to become an important academic without writing well, or to make\nsales or convince anyone of anything without making your case well.\n\nThis takes practice and coaching, and there is no substitute for ei-\nther. One also has to have something to say, so this means one has to\nhave had experiences to talk and write about. Further, it helps if one\nis writing about something that one is passionate about. Asking kids\nto write about their summer vacations doesn’t necessarily make them\ninto good writers. Asking kids to give speeches about George Washing-\nton fails for reasons of lack of passion. People need to learn to describe\nwell what is most important to them.

Unfortunately, nothing has happened as we hope and we have\nbeen forced into operations.\n\n* Your Highness the Prince, there are forces that are neither belonging to the legitimacy nor the\ncoupists.

The probation officer must conduct a presentence investigation and submit a report to the court before it\nimposes sentence unless:\n\n(i) /8 U.S.C. 3593(c) or another statute requires otherwise; or\n\n(i1) the court finds that the information in the record enables it to meaningfully exercise its sentencing authority under /8 U.S.C.\n3553, and the court explains its finding on the record.\n[*888]\n\n(B) Restitution. If the law requires permits restitution, the probation officer must conduct an investigation and submit a report\nthat contains sufficient information for the court to order restitution.\n\nThe Rationale:\n\nAs currently written, the rule directs that a presentence report contain information about restitution only when the law\n\"requires\" restitution. The proposed amendment directs that all presentence reports contain appropriate restitution information\nwhenever the law \"permits\" restitution. If the law permits restitution, the court ought to receive information sufficient to allow\nit to determine whether to order such restitution. Only with such knowledge can the court appropriately exercise its discretion.\n\nIn most cases, restitution is covered by one of two federal statutes: the Mandatory Victims Restitution Act of 1996 (MVRA),\n224 and its predecessor, the Victim and Witness Protection Act of 1982 (VWPA). 7%° For all crimes of violence and certain\ncrimes against property, the MVRA firmly directs that \"notwithstanding any other provision of law, when sentencing a\n\ndefendant convicted of [certain offenses such as crimes of violence] ... the court shall order ... that the defendant make\nrestitution to the victim of the offense or, if the victim is deceased, to the victim's estate.\" 226 For other crimes, the earlier\n22)\n\nVWPA controls. It permits the court to order restitution in its discretion after considering various relevant factors.\n\n3 See Letter from Ed Carnes, Chair of the Advisory Comm. on Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, to Hon.

Years ago, when I was pretty inexperienced in the\ncommunity, I had a single BDSM encounter with a gentleman in his home. We met at a\nBDSM discussion group, arranged to meet later at a cafe, and went home from there; as\nwe exited the cafe, I took his driver's license and texted his full name and license number\nto a friend. (I think more people should do this, frankly -- in fact, more non-BDSM\npeople should do this when they go home with strangers from bars.)\n\nWe sat together on the public transit and quietly discussed the upcoming scene: he asked\nme many, many questions about what I was okay with and not okay with. Questions like:\n\"What do you have experience with?\" \"Could you go into that more?” \"What do you\nlike?” \"What makes that fun for you?\" \"Is there anything you really don't want me to do?”\nHe asked a lot of the questions twice, too, which I think is a really great strategy\nespecially with new partners. People don't always have their heads together enough\nduring these conversations to answer an S&M question properly the first time, especially\nif it's a broad and open-ended question like \"What are the things you really don't want to\ndo?\"\n\nI made it clear that I just wanted a BDSM encounter, that I wasn't up for oral sex or\nvaginal sex or anything like that. He'd never had a BDSM encounter that didn't involve\norgasm, so it was a new concept for him, but he was cool with trying it.\n\nAfter our long discussion of boundaries and limits, we made it to his apartment and\nsettled in. He got out some equipment, including a collar, and he said: \"While you're\nwearing this, you will obey everything I say. Do you have any final boundaries to set?\nAnything you really want me to do? Anything else you don't want me to do?\" I said no,\nand he snapped on the collar. (We did have an agreed-upon safeword, though -- so I had a\nway of interrupting the proceedings if I really needed to.)\n\nIt was an interesting encounter, partly because he was looking more for dominance\n(giving orders) than sadism (inflicting pain), whereas at the time I was looking more for\nmasochism (receiving pain) than submission (accepting orders). So we started out with\nhim giving me a bunch of orders (primarily to fulfill his kink), and then in the end he hit\nme a lot with a leather belt (to fulfill mine). At the time I was still figuring out where the\nboundary was for me: whether I identified as a submissive or only a masochist; how\nmuch submission and masochism were intertwined. That night showed me a lot about\nhow one can create submissive energy within a pre-defined space, even with someone\nyou barely know.\n\nAfterwards, when I was done crying, he took off the collar and we went to bed. (By that\ntime of night, I didn't have a way back home from where he lived, so I had to sleep over.)\nWe chatted about random things, neither of us quite tired enough to sleep. Within half an\nhour or so, he realized that there was no way he was ever going to get to sleep unless he\nhad an orgasm, but he also understood that I didn't want to have sex with him, so he\ndidn't try to push that. Instead, he said: \"I really need to have an orgasm before I can get\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_018476\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

The bill defines industrial hemp as a variety of cannabis with a\nTHC concentration of </=0.3% and allows farmers to grow and sell hemp under state\nregulation. According to the National Conference of State Legislatures, 41 states have\nset up cultivation and production programs to regulate the production of hemp. (CT, ID,\nSD, IA, OH, TX, LA, MS and GA do not currently allow hemp cultivation.)\n\nHemp is currently being grown under state Industrial Research Pilot Programs. Once\nUSDA rules are released, pilot programs may end in favor of USDA rules and rules of\nstate programs approved by the USDA.\n\nPrior to the 2018 Farm Bill, the 2014 Farm Bill allowed universities and state\ndepartments of agriculture to conduct hemp research under Agricultural Pilot Programs\nin an effort to evaluate industrial hemp as a commercial crop. The bill allowed states to\nbegin research on best methods for hemp cultivation.\n\nCultivation Practices Of Hemp Dependent On Intended Harvestable Component\n\nHemp is grown for fiber, grain/seed and floral materials with different varieties of hemp\nplanted for each component. Fibers are used in rope and textiles, grain is used in human\nfood (not legal for animal feed), pressed seed oil from grain is used like sunflower seed\noil, and oils, including CBD, are removed from floral materials for health supplements.\n\nCultivation practices differ for fiber, grain/seed and CBD in an effort to maximize the\nyield of the desired harvestable component. U.S. states have conducted pilot programs\nin recent years to help gain a better understanding of best practices.\n\nLimited Research Available On CBD Hemp Cultivation\n\nThere is little research on CBD hemp cultivation methods as hemp cultivation research\nhistorically has focused on fiber and grain/seed. This lack of research, combined with a\nnumber of variables that impact hemp for CBD yield, makes hemp for CBD cultivation\nmuch more art than science at this point. Cultivation methods have been described as all\nover the map. That being said, we detail methods from recent academic research studies\nand conversations with industry participants below. (The University of Kentucky and\nUniversity of Vermont have both conducted research in CBD hemp cultivation in recent\nyears but further research is needed for conclusions regarding proper production\ntechniques.)\n\nHemp CBD Cultivation Steps:\n\ne §=© Obtaina license. Growers must obtain a grower license from their state\ndepartment of agriculture for the specific type of hemp they want to grow.\n\ne Find a buyer/processor. Growers then need to find a buyer/processor for their\nharvest as crops can only be sold to licensed processors.\n\ne Source seeds or clones. The grower must acquire seeds or transplants. Clones\n(rooted cutting of a plant) can be used instead of seeds. The key factor in\nselecting seeds or clones is understanding which strains produce flowers with\nhigh CBD concentrations while keeping THC at </=0.3% since CBD and THC are\npositively correlated which caps the CBD level.

It is a mix of the new and old Keating agenda: a shift in resources to the extractive industries; a lift in\ncapital inflow driving a high current account deficit putting a premium on savings; recognition that competitiveness\nwill lie \"in the creativity of our people as much as it does in our oil and gas\"; a renewed emphasis on the value of hi-\ntech and education; and above all, a cultural change that integrates Australia more into East Asia. \"Cultural\ntransformation is the key for us,\" Keating says. He rates it as more important than economic reform.\n\n“There is less interest now in being part of East Asia than there was in the 1990s,” he laments.\n\nKeating wants this idea revived. And he ties it to the republic arguing that to succeed in Asia we must become a\nrepublic, a proposition Howard always dismissed.\n\nOn China, Keating is an optimist yet alive to the daunting economic challenge China now confronts. \"What is\nhappening in China knows no precedence in world economic history,\" he says. \"Never before have 1.25 billion\npeople dragged themselves from poverty at such a pace. China is now half the GDP of the US and incomes have\nrisen by a factor of 10.\" He argues, however, that the origin of the 2008 financial crisis lies in the global imbalances -\nChina has built huge foreign exchange reserves by exporting too much and America, in turn, is saving too little.\n\nKeating says: \"China must shift the basis of growth from net exports and investment to domestic consumption. Will\nthey achieve this? Probably. Will there be strains along the way? There have to be.\"\n\nUnlike many Australian leaders, Keating is a Europhile. \"I think the European project is the most significant project\nsince the second world war,\" he says. But he sees two huge blunders made in Europe.\n\nFrom the euro's inception, Keating said it should constitute only Germany, France and the Benelux nations, not the\nperipheral countries around the Mediterranean, and \"Greece should never have been allowed in”.\n\nWhy were the weaker economies given entry?\n\nKeating says: \"It's because president Mitterrand and the French wanted it. They weren't ready to sit beside the\nGerman unified state without some friends.\"\n\nSo the eurozone was flawed from the outset, a structure awaiting internal assault: \"The problem is we have a single\ncurrency without a political union and without a fiscal union.\"\n\nThe second blunder was the 1990s expansion of NATO to the Russian border. For Keating, this was recklessness\nfor which the world may yet pay.\n\n\"Sensible policy would have included a place for Russia in the new world order,” he says. “But that didn't happen.\nSo Russian liberals were pushed to one side by Russian nationalists. In a sense the US has created Vladimir Putin.\"\n\nWho is responsible? He points the finger at Bill Clinton.\n\nOn the 2008 financial crisis, he says former US Federal Reserve chief Alan Greenspan must bear \"a fair amount of\nresponsibility”.\n\n\"Greenspan is someone | know and like,” Keating says. \"But if you are so naive to believe that institutions with a\nbalance sheet with assets geared at 45 to one is not an accident waiting to happen then you don't deserve to be\n\nchairman of the Federal Reserve.\"\n\nHe praises Obama for seeking a return to the “liberal internationalism\" that, in Keating's view, made the US great in\nthe post-World War Il age. This is the US he loves but it is still in retreat.\n\nAsked about the nature of leadership, Keating reveals what lies within his heart: \"| believe there is a poetic strand to\nlife that doesn't exist in an economics textbook.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_029661\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

Genuine peace, and trust, would inevitably take years to reach fruition.\nThat was no mere academic problem in a conflict where, for decades, our\nenemies had defined Israel’s mere existence as illegitimate. The reason for\nRabin’s reluctance to have his “deposit” presented as a set negotiating position\nwas that it meant dealing away our only card — territory — before the hard\nquestions about peace had been answered. When he phoned Christopher, I don’t\nthink I’ve ever heard him as angry. That was not what we agreed, he insisted.\nHe said it had spoiled any prospect of serious negotiations on the peace side of\nthe balance. Christopher didn’t agree there had been any real damage, nor that\nAssad had failed to understand the context.\n\nIt might not have changed things anyway, since by this stage, the Oslo talks\nhad almost completed a draft agreement. In mid-August, Rabin gave Peres the\ngo-ahead to initial this “Declaration of Principles.” It provided for a period of\ninterim Palestinian self-government; the start of a phased Israeli withdrawal\nfrom Gaza and the West Bank with the creation of a Palestinian police force to\ndeal with internal security; and a commitment to reach a full peace agreement\nwithin five years. In early September, ahead of the formal signing of the Oslo\ndeclaration, there was an exchange of “letters of recognition” between Arafat\nand Rabin. Arafat’s letter also renounced “terrorism and other acts of violence”\nand declared invalid “those articles of the Palestinian Covenant which deny\nIsrael’s right to exist.” A few days later, the signing ceremony was hosted by\nPresident Clinton in Washington. Thus emerged the famous photo of Rabin and\nArafat shaking hands, on either side of Clinton, who was beaming, arms\noutstretched in conciliation. They say a picture is worth a thousand words. In\nthis case, you needed barely a dozen. Rabin’s demeanor, his posture, the look\non his face, all seemed to say: “I would rather be shaking the hand of anyone on\nearth than Arafat.” Still, the image was on front pages worldwide. The news\nstories spoke of a new spirit of hope. Now that these old enemies had grasped\nhands, surely a full peace agreement was within reach.\n\nMy feeling, as I watched it on TV in the kirya, was more guarded. I did hope\nfor peace, of course. I also recognized that the signing on the White House lawn\nwas just a beginning, and that my role would be to ensure that Israel’s security\nneeds were met under whatever formal peace agreement might eventually be\nreached. And the security omens were hardly encouraging. Despite Oslo,\nPalestinian attacks were continuing. Hamas, Islamic Jihad, and other dissident\nfactions saw Arafat’s concessions as treachery, and were setting out to drive\nhome that point with violence.\n\n257\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_011728\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

Each of these algo-\nrithms is complex and has its own story; for instance (an incomplete list, for more detail see\nthe following section of this Introduction):\n\ne Declarative knowledge is handled using Probabilistic Logic Networks, described in Chapter\n34 and others;\n\ne Procedural knowledge is handled using MOSES, a probabilistic evolutionary learning algo-\nrithm described in Chapter 21 and others;\n\ne Attentional knowledge is handled by ECAN (economic attention allocation), described in\nChapter 23 and others;\n\ne OpenCog contains a language comprehension system called RelEx that takes English sen-\ntences and turns them into nodes and links in the AtomSpace. It’s currently being ex-\ntended to handle Chinese. RelEx handles mostly declarative knowledge but also involves\nsome procedural knowledge for linguistic phenomena like reference resolution and semantic\ndisambiguation.\n\nBut the crux of the CogPrime cognitive architecture is not any particular cognitive process,\nbut rather the way they all work together using cognitive synergy.\n\n1.8 Virtually and Robotically Embodied AI\n\nAnother issue that will arise frequently in these pages is embodiment. There’s a lot of debate in\nthe AI community over whether embodiment is necessary for advanced AGI or not. Personally,\nwe doubt it’s necessary but we think it’s extremely convenient, and are thus considerably\ninterested in both virtual world and robotic embodiment. The CogPrime architecture itself is\nneutral on the issue of embodiment, and it could be used to build a mathematical theorem\nprover or an intelligent chat bot just as easily as an embodied AGI system. However, most of\nour attention has gone into figuring out how to use CogPrime to control embodied agents in\nvirtual worlds, or else (to a lesser extent) physical robots. For instance, during 2011-2012 we\nare involved in a Hong Kong government funded project using OpenCog to control video game\nagents in a simple game world modeled on the game Minecraft [GPC™ 11].\n\nCurrent virtual world technology has significant limitations that make them far less than\nideal from an AGI perspective, and in Chapter 16 we will discuss how they can be remedied.\nHowever, for the medium-term future virtual worlds are not going to match the natural world\nin terms of richness and complexity — and so there’s also something to be said for physical\nrobots that interact with all the messiness of the real world.\n\nWith this in mind, in the Artificial Brain Lab at Xiamen University in 2009-2010, we con-\nducted some experiments using OpenCog to control the Nao humanoid robot [GD09]. The goal\nof that work was to take the same code that controls the virtual dog and use it to control the\nphysical robot. But it’s harder because in this context we need to do real vision processing\nand real motor control. A similar project is being undertaken in Hong Kong at time of writ-\ning, involving a collaboration between OpenCog AI developers and David Hanson’s robotics\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_012927\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

On the active risk side of the equation, we have seen lower gross\nexposure and net-market exposure within the overall hedge funds group, with traders being cautiously\npositioned. With systemic risk at bay, we favor relative-value (RV ) and event-driven (ED) strategies.\n\n¢ The inherent hedging in relative value is appealing. Credit relative-value managers should perform well\nin this environment of higher fixed-income volatility and increasing pricing anomalies created by central\nbank interventions and limited competition.\n\n¢ While ED managers share some of the performance drivers, idiosyncratic bets reduce the correlation to\nmarkets. The real reason to own this strategy, however, is the potential for outsized returns in distressed,\nhigh-yield, and other credit investments as the Eurozone crisis plays out.\n\nA Positive scenario Prefer Equity long-short\n¢ Reduced uncertainty (e.g. resolution in Europe) lowers equities’ correlation and volatility. This helps\nbottom-up fundamental analysis and equity long/short managers the most. Also, CEOs will likely make\nmore corporate transactions that can be monetized by event-driven managers, and a clearer\nmacroeconomic environment with more persistent trends would support CTA managers.\n‘Negative scenario Prefer Trading (Global Macro + CTA)\n° So far this year, the market has remained plagued by short-term reversals, due to central banks’\nintervention and stimulus effects, an obstacle for trend-following managers. Still, if the European\ndeleveraging (or fiscal cliff, China hard landing) is unmanaged, this could threaten risky assets. Trading\ncan do well if such a scenario unfolds.\n\nNote: Scenarios refer to global economic scenarios (see slide 7).\n\nWhat we're Why it matters\nwatching\nGlobal equity direction/\n\neconomic cycle\n\nThe outlook for global equities is an important HF performance driver. The\neconomic cycle impacts the strategies differently.\n\nCorrelation Correlation is an important performance/alpha driver for equity long/short, the\nlargest HF strategy by assets under management.\n\nLeverage Gross and net leverage are key to monitoring risk.\n\nVolatility The direction influences certain HF strategies (e.g. convertible arbitrage).\n\nLiquidity Important in particular for large, less nimble HFs, it enables them to enter and\nexit their strategies.\n\nRegulation Volcker rule, USCITS III/IV\n\n2 UBS\n\nRecommendations\nStrategic (1 to 2 years)\n\nRecommendation: Active risk\nmanagement is instrumental for capital\npreservation during adverse market\nconditions. At the moment, we therefore\nfavor relative-value and event-driven\nstrategies, since they are less correlated to\nequity markets and other risky assets than\ntrading.\n\nValue proposition: Hedge funds should\nachieve robust performance over an\nextended horizon, while displaying\nlimited volatility vis-a-vis equities and\nother risky assets. Hedge funds try to\nminimize downside losses in adverse\nmarket conditions (e.g. active risk\nmanagement), which plays a crucial role in\nwealth appreciation.

As the CIA, FBI and NSA found out in the 1990s,\nNo intelligence service is invulnerable to it. Any employee of a large intelligence organization can\nturn, or be turned, against it. Among the more than 10,000 intelligence workers employed by the\nNSA, it is a near certainty that over time one or more of them will become dissatisfied with their\nwork. He or she may have a personal grievance about their pay, lack of promotion or their\ntreatment by their superiors. Disenchantment with the NSA may also proceed from idealistic\nobjections. After all, the NSA is in the business of secretly intercepting messages, and an insider\ncould find its spying activities at odds with his or her own beliefs about the violation of privacy.\nFor any of these reasons, a disgruntled insider could go rogue. He or she then might attempt to\nright a perceived wrong by disclosing the NSA secrets to another party. That party might then\ninduce or blackmail the rogue employee into disclosing further secrets. To guard against it, the\nNSA has developed a well-organized system for stratifying its data so that obtaining critical\nsecrets would require a rogue employee to burrow into its heavily protected inner sanctum. As\npart of this system, the NSA divides its data into different tiers depending on the importance of\nthe secrets to its operations. The first tier, Level 1, is mainly administrative material. This data\nwould include FISA court orders and other directives it employees might need to check on to\ncarry out their tasks. Level 2 contains data from which the secret sources have been removed.\nThis tier, available to other intelligence services and policy-makers, includes reports and analysis\nthat can be shared.

My passion is the Italian Renaissance and the rich history behind it, especially the works of 15th century masters such \nas Masaccio and Bellini. Some of the courses that NYU offers such as \"Early masters of Italian Renaissance painting\" and \"Florentine \nVillas: An Interpretation Based on Historical, Social Factors\" are, therefore appealing to me. What I find exciting, is not only the \nvisual aesthetics and analysis of these masterpieces, but also the manner in which the Renaissance emphasised scientific and \neconomic innovation, areas of study the Global Liberal Arts programme would offer. NYU's unique campus in Florence would give \nme a once in lifetime opportunity to spend a year immersing myself in the art, culture and history of Italy. This would be an exciting \nexperience to have while studying for a Bachelor's degree in Art History, and would compliment my main interests in the subject. \nAs one of the prime cultural centres in the world, NYU's location in NYC is the perfect place to broaden knowledge within \ncontemporary art. I am very much looking forward to visiting the Whitney Biennia this May. In addition the New museum, which \nshows a lot of the kind of work I find interesting is a short walk away from campus. \nTaking advantage of being based in central London for the past year, I have completed the Chairman's Programme at Christies, work \nexperience at the Courtauld Gallery and I will be working at Maddox Gallery in the near future. Similarly, I want to take advantage of \nbeing based in NYC to gain as much experience as possible. I have chosen to apply Early Decision to NYU as it is the only American \nuniversity I will be applying to, as there is no better place to obtain experience of the contemporary art world than New York City. \nEssay 2. \nFrom the age of extremes to the age of bewilderment \nWhat captivates me more than anything else is the different ideological phases of the 20th century and how art can be used as a \ntool of advancement and reflection on ideological and political developments. \nMy fascination began when I read; Eric Hobsbawm's \"Age Of Extremes\" and has since developed through books such as \nBenjamin Carter Heft's \"The Death Of Democracy\" and Yuval Harari \"A Brief History Of Tomorrow\" and \"21 Lessons For \nThe 21st Century\". \nIn the years after the First World War, until the end of the Second World War, three political models for shaping the future of \nnation states emerged; Fascism, Communism and liberal democracy. These all offered great ideas for the future of the world. \nFascism and Communism shared some common features: authoritarian, strong leaders and a belief that their revolutions had to \nbe carried through with violence. This led to the mass murders in the Nazi concentration camps and in the Soviet Gulags. \nIn the mid war periods, the \"Litfass columns\" that were originally designed to carry advertising, became the outdoor galleries \nfor the war of ideologies. The political poster was born. High quality posters from every political party in Germany popped up \non the columns. Hitler's propaganda chief G8ebels stated that the Nazi election campaign should be run through speeches and \nposters. The other parties responded in kind. An art form thus became an essential political tool in the battle for votes. The \npropagandist Art used by the Nazis and communists alike was essential in helping sell their message to the masses. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 033414 \nIndeed, much of the art that was critical of these movements was suppressed or censored and \"subversive\" artists cowed, in \nsome cases imprisoned or even worse. \nThe liberal democratic model departed sharply from these authoritarian perspectives by presenting the alternative of free and \ntransparent elections, the rule of law and freedom of speech. In the mid-war period the three narratives were competing to be the \nconceptual frame for society. After the Second World War fascism was crushed leaving the two competing ideologies of \ncommunism and liberal democracy. After the demise of communism in 1989, through to the late 1990's, liberal democracy was \nvictorious in the idealogical battlefield. Some historians, like Francis Fukuyama, went so far as to proclaim this period as \"the \nend of history\". \nA key piece of art that championed this kind of ideology was Sheppard Fairey's campaign poster for Barack Obama. In this \nposter, Fairey, a well established graffiti artist uses urban colours and stencilling techniques combined with the message \n\"HOPE\" to promote the incoming presidents positive values and popularity with the young. It is notable that Fairey's most \nrecent political poster protests the Trump presidency rather than promote it. \nWith the rise of so called \"illiberal democracy\", with strong parties standing for populist ideologies, we have now moved into \nwhat can be described as the age of bewilderment. We were not in fact at the \"end of history\". Once again the future looks \nunpredictable and insecure and artists are responding in different ways. \nJeremy Deller, a British Turner prize winning artist created a work which features a car damaged in the bombing of the historic \nMutanabbi Street book market, which resulted in the deaths of 38 people. Here, an art work has been used to show the aftermath \nof an event. This event was the result of the Iraq war, which was seen as a way to spread democracy. Here Art is used as a \nmeans by which to explore the effects of ideology rather than promote it, another really interesting area in the study of the \nintersections between ideology and art. \nExploring how art reflects the historical and ideological contexts of the world around it is fascinating to me and I would love to \nstudy these ideas in more depth at undergraduate level. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 033415 \n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

Programs that fail to make a difference — like many of those that train\nworkers for new jobs — endure indefinitely. Often, policy makers don’t even know which work and which\ndon’t, because rigorous evaluation is rare in government. And competition, which punishes laggards in the\nprivate sector, is typically absent in the public sector.\n\nBut there is some good news on this front. Lately, both American and British policy makers have been thinking\nabout how to bring some of the competitive discipline of the market to government programs, and they have hit\non an intriguing idea.\n\nDavid Cameron’s Conservative government in Britain is already testing it, at a prison 75 miles north of London.\nThe Bloomberg administration in New York is also considering the idea, as is the State of Massachusetts.\nPerhaps most notably, President Obama next week will propose setting aside $100 million for seven such pilot\nprograms, according to an administration official.\n\nThe idea goes by one of two names: pay for success bonds or social impact bonds. Either way, nonprofit groups\nlike foundations pay the initial money for a new program and also oversee it, with government approval. The\ngovernment will reimburse them several years later, possibly with a bonus — but only if agreed-upon\nbenchmarks show that the program is working.\n\nIf it falls short, taxpayers owe nothing.\n\nThe first British test is happening at Her Majesty’s Prison Peterborough, where 60 percent of the prisoners are\nconvicted of another crime within one year of release. Depressingly enough, that recidivism rate is typical for a\nBritish prison.\n\nTo reduce the rate, a nonprofit group named Social Finance is playing a role akin to venture capitalist. It has\nraised about $8 million from investors, including the Rockefeller Foundation. Social Finance also oversees three\nsocial service groups helping former prisoners find work, stay healthy and the like. If any of those groups starts\nto miss its performance goals, it can be replaced.\n\nFor the investors to get their money back starting in 2014 — with interest — the recidivism rate must fall at\nleast 7.5 percent, relative to a control group. If the rate falls 10 percent, the investors will receive the sort of\nreturn that the stock market historically delivers. “It’s been only a few months,” says Tracy Palandjian, who\nrecently opened a new Social Finance office in Boston, “but the numbers are coming in O.K.”\n\nAntony Bugg-Levine of the Rockefeller Foundation told me it had invested in the project for two main reasons.\nOne, it expected to get its money back and then be able to reuse it. Two, if social impact bonds work, they have\nthe potential to attract for-profit investors — and vastly expand the pool of capital that’s available for social\nprograms.\n\nClearly, social impact bonds have limitations. For starters, it’s hard to see how private money could ever pay for\nmultibillion-dollar programs like Medicaid or education.\n\nJust as important, the execution of any bond program will be complicated. It will depend on coming up with the\nright performance measures, which is no small matter. Done wrong, the measures will end up rewarding\nprograms lucky (or clever) enough to enroll participants who are more likely to succeed no matter what.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_030324\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

For example, Marinol and Syndros, which the\nFDA cleared for the treatment of anorexia associated with weight loss in AIDS patients,\ninclude the active ingredient dronabinol, a synthetic delta-9- tetrahydrocannabinol\n(THC) which is considered the psychoactive component of marijuana. In June 2048, the\nFDA approved an oral formulation of cannabidiol (CBD), Epidiolex, which GW\nPharmaceuticals PLC developed for the treatment of seizures associated with two rare\nand severe forms of epilepsy in children.\n\nn addition to THC and CBD, more than 100 other phytocannabinoids have been\nidentified from the cannabis plant. This includes lesser-known compounds such as\ntetrahydrocannabivarin (THCV), cannabigerol (CBG), and cannabichromene (CBC).\n\nThe broad spectrum of phytocannabinoids can bind to a range of different receptors in\nthe human body and induce a wide variety of pharmacological responses.

He nodded in gratitude when he’d finished, and returned to\nBibi’s team on the far wing. I gave him a full minute to be certain he was in\nplace.\n\nThen I whistled. From my initial position beside the plane, I saw Danny\nYatom and his team begin to move one of the tall ladders toward the front door.\nShifting my eyes toward the wing doors as the “crucial first five seconds” ticked\nby, I saw both the ones on my side of the plane were still shut. I climbed up on\nthe wing. When I got to the smaller, rear door I saw the main one cave inward\nand Mordechai Rachamim rush in. But the soldier on the other door was\ntrembling and frozen in place. I slapped him, hard, on the back. “Move!” I\nshouted. Instantly, he pushed the door in and rushed inside. I then noticed Uzi\nand his team had still not entered from the rear. I jumped from the wing and ran\ntoward the ladder at the back, but by the time I got there, they had made it\ninside, and I followed them in.\n\nEverything was over within 90 seconds. As I’d expected, the planning and\ntraining turned out to matter less than instinct and initiative. Within seconds, Uri\nKoren managed to get into the nose-wheel assembly. Though he couldn’t\ndislodge a metal-mesh panel separating it from the cockpit, he spotted the\noutline of a man’s foot above him, fired, and wounded Captain Rifa’at. The\nother members of Danny’s team in front were less lucky. With the ladder, they\nhad no trouble getting to the passenger door, but they struggled to force it open.\nWhen they did nudge it open a crack, one of the hijackers opened fire, slightly\nwounding one of the men and forcing them to abandon the attempt.\n\nMordechai went in shooting, but immediately drew fire and had to retreat.\nBut Omer Wachman, another air marshal I’d posted on the far wing, was ina\ncouple of seconds later. Coming face-to-face with one of the hijackers, he shot\nhim in the head. That allowed Mordechai to get back inside. He quickly\nexchanged fire with the hobbled Captain Rifa’at, hitting the hijacker in the side.\nAs Mordechai ducked down to reload his pistol, Rifa’at managed to lock\nhimself inside one of the toilets near the cockpit. Mordechai ran after him. He\nfired through the bathroom door, then kicked it open and confirmed that he was\ndead. Rushing back toward the center of plane, he spotted the main woman\nhijacker, wearing a bulky explosive vest. Grabbing her hands, he reached inside\nthe vest and yanked out the battery pack. With two of the hijackers already\ndead, Mordechai had now subdued the third. But knowing that there was still\nanother woman unaccounted for, he handed her over to Bibi and Marco\nAshkenazi.

I said we needed to remind ourselves of the\narmy’s purpose: to protect Israel’s security and, if a war came, to win it. My\nbudgetary rule of thumb over the next four years would be simple: anything that\ndidn’t directly contribute to that mission was expendable. In fact, I put it a bit\nmore bluntly: “We need to cut anything that doesn’t shoot.”\n\nMy first attempt failed utterly. I proposed to close, or sell off, the army’s\nradio station, Galei Tzahal. Running it cost serious money. If we were going to\ncut everything that didn’t shoot, it was an obvious candidate. But what I failed\nto take into account was its popularity with the listening public. Although other\nradio stations had opened recently, for many years it had been the only major\nalternative to the state-funded Kol Yisrael. It also provided a training ground\nand employment feeder for future journalists. Galei Tzahal’s alumni included\nsome of the country’s top media figures, and more than a few members of the\nKnesset. Within weeks, a lobbying effort was underway to “save” the station. I\nwent to see Misha. He agreed that, from a military and budgetary standpoint,\nclosing it was the right thing to do. But in an early lesson in how different\npolitics were from the army, he told me that politically, it simply wasn’t going\nto fly. “Drop it, Ehud,” he said. So I did.\n\nStill, I did end up fundamentally retooling the armed forces during my time\nas chief of staff. We developed agile new strike forces and high-precision, high-\ntech weapons systems with “stand-off” munitions designed to be fired from\nmany miles away. In the 1973 war, and for the decade or two that followed,\nSaggers, and the US-made TOW missiles that Israel acquired after the war, had\nthe capability to transform a battlefield. Now, Israeli developers came up with\nsmall, ground-launched missiles that could take out a tank from five to 10 miles\naway, even without a direct line of sight to the target. Of even more long-term\nmilitary significance, I pushed ahead with developing pilotless drones — so-\ncalled UAVs — making us the first army in the world to produce and deploy\nthem.\n\nYet for a security challenge like the intifada, even the most advanced stand-\noff munitions or UAVs offered no practical answer. The latest stage in the\nviolence involved knife attacks by Palestinians against Israeli civilians, both on\nWest Bank settlers and inside Israel. Days after I took over, a 26-year-old from\nGaza, wielding a butcher’s knife and shouting Alahu Akhbar, killed four people,\n\n243\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_011714\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

Now the question is, How to we teach him to get better at\nthem?\n\nFirst let’s see what the cognitive processes fundamentally have in\ncommon. This will give us a way of thinking about how to teach them.\n\nThe first and most important thing they have in common is that\nthey all rely on a case base. We have all engaged in each of these\nprocesses many times and we have a range of experiences we can call\nupon to guide us the next time we find ourselves doing them. Each\nprocess relies on a story base as well. We can tell stories about inter-\nesting experiences we have had in doing each one of them. Stories\nusually revolve around failures, or at least unexpected results, since\nwithout these there are no good Stories to tell. Engaging in any cogni-\ntive process includes the possibility of making a mistake during the\nprocess. We expect to get smarter each time as a result of any mistakes\nwe make. This is what cognitive processes are like. We learn cognitive\nprocesses through experience and we index the failures we have so\nthat we can find them again and perhaps avoid making the same mis-\ntake. When we avoid an error that we know we have made previously,\nwe say that we have learned.\n\nIt follows, therefore, that acquiring a case base, learning the sto-\nries of others and learning to tell our own stories, and learning classic\nmistakes and being able to analyze behavior to find a mistake are all\naspects of learning the cognitive processes.\n\nAcquiring the case base and consciously analyzing the cases in\nthat case base, then, is the fundamental issue in teaching the cogni-\ntive processes.\n\nHOW TO TEACH PREDICTION\n\nWe live in a physical world but we also live in a social world. Children\nneed to understand that if they drop something heavy on their foot,\nit will hurt; they also need to know that if they do something mean\nto someone, the person may dislike them for it and may seek revenge.\nWe use predictions to figure out what will happen as a result of our\nactions and then we use that knowledge to guide us in our future\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_023857\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

She then moved in with Snowden. Even though she had been living on and\noff with Snowden during the past two years abroad, including while he worked at the CIA in\nSwitzerland and the NSA in Japan, they had not shared a home in America up until now. The\nnow 25-year old Mills posted on Instagram “Finally in our first US place together.” She also put\non line pictures of him in bed with her, who she now affectionately referred to in her posts as a\n“computer crusader.”\n\nDell meanwhile had him to work on problem- solving for its corporate clients. In preparation\nfor his corporate role, he shaved off this facial hair and, with Lindsay’s help, bought a Ralph\nLauren suit. These corporate clients were assisting the NSA, the CIA, and the Defense\nIntelligence Agency (DIA). Consequently, Snowden dealt with a wide range of intelligence\nofficers, and gave presentations on the vulnerabilities at computer security at the DIA-sponsored\nJoint Counter Intelligence seminar.\n\nHis dealings with these US intelligence officers in no way mitigated his resentment of the\nintelligence establishment. What began at the CIA in 2009 as objections to what he saw as the\nincompetence of his superiors grew into well-articulated disapproval of the way that the US\ngovernment conducted its intelligence. He found NSA surveillance particularly worrisome, later\ntelling the Guardian: \"They [the NSA] are intent on making every conversation and every form of\nbehavior in the world known to them.\" He claimed after defecting to Moscow that he had voiced\nhis concerns about what he considered illicit surveillance to ten NSA officials, “none of whom\ntook any action to address them.” The NSA can find no record of these complaints but if\nSnowden had indeed complained to these officials while working for Dell, his superiors at Dell\neither didn’t notice or care that they had a very disgruntled employee on their hand. He also\nmade no secret of anger at the US government and the corporations that served it on the Internet.\nHe railed on the Ars Technica site against the complicity of private corporations, such as Dell,\nthat assisted the NSA. In his on-line posts in 2010, Snowden expressed loathing for the\nassistance that corporate America was providing the intelligence community. “It really concerns\nme how little this sort of corporate behavior bothers those outside of technology circles,” he\nwrote under his True Hoo-ha alias. He said he feared that America was already on “a slippery\nslope,” and suggested, perhaps adumbrating his own later actions, that this corporate assistance to\nUS intelligence “was entirely within our control to stop.” What the “computer crusader,” as Mills\nhad playfully called him in her Internet postings, expressed in these angry Internet postings was an\nalmost obsessive concern over individuals freely submitting to government authority. “Society\nreally seems to have developed an unquestioning obedience towards spooky types,” he wrote on\nArs Technica without mentioning that he himself worked for a corporation, Dell that assisted spy\nagencies. He asked rhetorically on this public forum whether the sinister slide towards a\nsurveillance state “sneaked in undetected because of pervasive government secrecy?”\n\nThe outright contempt he expressed towards this “government secrecy” in no way prevented\nhim from seeking even more secret work at Dell for the intelligence services.

If any party was looking for a\ndisgruntled US employees, Snowden’s Internet chatter about bad choices in gambling could\narouse its interest. That Snowden used his TheTrueHooHa alias for these Internet posting would\nnot prevent a sophisticated espionage organization, such as the Russian Intelligence service, from\nquickly uncovering that his true identity was Edward Snowden. Nor would it be difficult to place\nhim at the CIA since, it will be recalled, he was listed by his true name on the roster of the US\nMission to the UN. By consulting personnel records it would further emerge that he did not\nactually work for the State Department. Since it was no secret, at least to the Russian\nIntelligence services, that the US mission in Geneva housed the CIA station for all of Switzerland,\nit was probable that this brittle gambler who played the options market worked for the CIA. Even\nthough it cannot be precluded that Snowden was spotted in Geneva by another intelligence\nservice, there is no evidence, at least that I know of, to suggest that he was approached by one.\nNor is there reason to believe that if he had been contacted by a foreign service in 2008, he would\nhave responded positively. Despite his indiscreet posting about his outside activities, he\napparently still respected the boundaries of secrecy that had been clearly defined in the oath he\nhad taken in the CIA. For example, after the New York Times published an article revealing\nsecret American intelligence activities in Iran on January 11, 2009, Snowden railed against the\nnewspaper on the Internet under his True HOOHA alias, He wrote “This shit is classified for a\nreason... It’s because this shit won’t work if Iran knows what we are doing.” He clearly\nrecognized that revealing intelligence sources was extremely damaging. As for the New York\nTimes, he said “Hopefully they’ll finally go bankrupt this year.” When another Internet user asked\nhim if it was unethical to release national security secrets, he answered,” YEEEEEEEEEES.”\n\nNevertheless, he had his career-ending problem at the CIA. As with every CIA officer, he had\nto undergo a two year evaluation and take a routine polygraph test. It was then, in December\n2008, that his superior at the CIA placed the “derog” in his file. The reason remains somewhat\nmurky. According to a New York Times story by veteran intelligence reporter Eric Schmitt,\nSnowden’s superior had suspected that Snowden “was trying to break into classified computer\nfiles to which he was not authorized to have access.” Schmitt evidently had well-placed sources in\nthe CIA. He said that he interviewed two senior American officials who were familiar with the\ncase. According to what they told Schmitt, the CIA superior had decided to “send Snowden\nhome.” Officially, however, according to a CIA reply to the New York Times report, Snowden\nhad not been fired or accused of attempting to “break into classified computer files to which he\ndid not have authorized access.” The discrepancy was explained to me by a former CIA officer\nwho had also been at the US Mission in Geneva. He said that the spin the CIA put on the story\nwas “necessary containment.” After the Snowden breach occurred in June 2013, the CIA had a\nproblem which could, as he put it, “blow up in its face.” If Snowden had been fired but allowed\nto keep his secrecy clearance in 2009, the CIA’s incompetency could be partly blamed for the\nNSA’s subsequent employment of him. If he had broken into a computer he was not authorized,\nhe should have been fired, if not arrested. What this spin glossed over, according to this former\nCIA officer, is the part of Snowden’s behavior that concerned his superior.

George Williams in 1976 and John Tooby in 1980 had argued that\nfittest genes in one generation might not be fittest in the next if niche pressures\nvaried to counter current gene choices. Tooby had pointed to parasites and\npathogens, particularly single-cell ones whose life cycle runs less than an hour. They\ncould evolve new strains to outflank our old defenses and call for new ones.\nHamilton and Zuk continued this theme. They suggested that genes might have long\nmemories, put in human terms, and might have seen the same parasites and\npathogens pull such tricks before. If some individuals in the host population still\ncarried the antidote gene that worked the last time the same unexpected strain\narose, or something close enough to it, hosts collectively could weather the threat if\nthat antidote gene could be identified and spread fast enough. Then how? Hamilton\nand Zuk proposed that what winning males display in contests of singing or\ncroaking or agility or symmetry, or bright colors in the right places, was possession\nof the genes needed to counter the current strains of pathogens and parasites.\nLosers in the same contests carried genes that had proved best against strains of the\npast and might come back in the future. Nepotism practiced by winners would\nspeed up the spread of the current antidote. But losers carried genes that had\nworked against other strains that might recur. A way had to be found to keep all\nthose potential antidotes somewhere in the medicine cabinet. Current losers had to\nbe saved for later. Gene diversity was the key to group survival in the long run. The\nquarterback trots to the bench on fourth down because that is better for himself and\nthe team than being carried to the hospital.

After the US imposed sanctions on the Syrian leadership earlier in May,\n\nthe EU foreign ministers agreed to impose travel bans and to freeze the assets of President Assad and nine other Syrian\nsenior officials. Within days of the EU announcement, Canada invoked similar travel and economic sanctions.\n\nWhile Russia blocked any reference in the G8 communiqué to the possibility of deferring the issue of Syria to the UN\nSecurity Council, the communiqué’s compromise language illustrates the international community's increased pressure on\nthe regime. The G8 leaders stated that they were “appalled” by the death of peaceful protesters and called on the Syrian\nleadership to immediately stop using force against its people or the G-8 countries would “consider taking further measures’.\n\nAt the same time, Sheikh Hassan Nasrallan—the leader of the Lebanese party Hizbullah—called on the Syrian people to\ngive the government time to effectuate reforms, arguing that President Assad believes in reforming the system and is\ndetermined to implement change. The Hizbullah leader denied that his party has dispatched fighters to assist the Syrian\nregime in quelling the protest movement. Anti-lran and -Hizbullah slogans were chanted in a number of Syrian cities in\nresponse to Nasrallah’s defense of the regime and his pictures were burned in Deir Ezzor in eastern Syria.\n\nSyrian protesters declared Friday “the day of the Guardians of the Homeland’—a reference to the Syrian armed forces—in\nan effort to encourage the army to join the uprising. Security and military forces appear, however, to be stepping up their\ncampaign in an attempt to end the protests. Tens of people were killed or wounded over the weekend and tanks have\nentered two suburbs of the city of Homs, Rastan, and Talbiseh. The heavy-handed repression by police and military officials\nmay lead demonstrators to consider a recourse to arms.\n\nThe government is cracking down on protesters’ use of social media, but, in contrast to what occurred in Egypt, it has\nrefrained from a general shut down of the internet. Security officials are forcing dissidents to turn over their Facebook\n\npasswords and have switched off 3G mobile networks in order to prevent the uploading of protestor videos to YouTube.\nThe electricity and phone service has been cut off in neighborhoods where discontent is mounting.\n\nFacebook and, in particular, its “Syrian Revolution 2011” page, has been a vital platform for activists to mobilize protests\nand to disseminate information. Syria has over 580,000 Facebook users. In response to government measures, protesters\nhave created multiple Facebook pages under different names and have given their Facebook passwords to friends in case\nthey are arrested or disappear and their comments opposing the Assad regime need to be quickly removed from personal\nwebpages.\n\nSyrian activists acknowledge their debt to the Tunisian and Egyptian revolutions, further improvising and improving on their\ntactics on a daily basis in an effort to avoid retribution by the regime and to sustain the protest movement. Daytime\ndemonstrations have moved to the evening in order to make it more difficult for security forces to identify individual protesters\nand to single them out for arrest. After dark, protesters can disperse to unlit alleyways to escape arrest—a tactic Syrian\nactivists call “tayyara” or flying.\n\nYemen\n\nThe authority of President Saleh’s government continues to erode rapidly and Yemen appears to be edging closer towards\na civil war. Tribal fighters in the capital of Sanaa, have gained control of key ministries, including the Interior Ministry.\n\nBrigades from the Republican Guard—the President’s main forces—have surrendered to tribal fighters east and west of the\ncapital who have succeeded in blocking their deployment to Sanaa.\n\nAccording to well-informed sources, the Vice President, the Prime Minister, and the Speaker of the Yemeni Consultative\nCouncil have tried to convince President Saleh to sign the agreement mediated by the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) in\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_031329\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

The critique is profoundly misplaced, supported neither by the law or the facts,\nnor by the structure of our constitutional republic. To the contrary, Jeffrey was subjected to an unprecedented\nfederal intrusion into a quintessentially local criminal matter in south Florida. His offense to the social order --\ninvolving sex for hire -- was entirely a matter entrusted to laws of the several States, not the federal\ngovernment. His conduct -- a classic state offense --was being treated exactly that way by able, honest\nprosecutors in Palm Beach County, but the overweening federal government intruded where it did not\n\nbelong. And now, over ten years after the fact, the current assault on federal decision-makers at the time,\nincluding now-Secretary of Labor Alex Acosta (then the United States Attorney in south Florida), condemns\nthe federal authorities for not going far enough.\n\nThe critics are entirely wrong. Neither the facts nor the law support the misguided criticisms being leveled by\njournalists and politicians at federal officials from over a decade ago -- including the highest levels of the\nJustice Department in Washington, D.C. .\n\nHere are the key facts: Jeffrey Epstein, a successful self-made businessman with no prior criminal history\nwhatever, engaged in illegal conduct that amounts to solicitation of prostitution. That was wrong, and it was\nreasonably viewed as a violation of Florida state law. Although no coercion, violence, alcohol, drugs and the\nlike were involved, the unsavory facts were carefully assessed by experienced state prosecutors who\naggressively enforce state criminal laws. No one turned a blind eye to potential offenses to the public\n\norder. To the contrary, the Palm Beach State Attorney's Office conducted an extensive 15-month\ninvestigation, led by the chief of the Sex Crimes Division. Mr. Epstein was then indicted by a state grand jury\non a single felony count of solicitation of prostitution.\n\nDuring that intense investigation, the state prosecutors extensively gathered and analyzed the evidence, met\nface-to-face with many of the asserted victims, considered their credibility -- or lack thereof -- and considered\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_030318\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

I even briefly thought of leaving the army\nafter Dan’s term ended the following year. I’m not sure whether I would have\ndone that if the situation had not begun to change. But it did, dramatically. The\nintifada gradually began to subside, and an entirely new crisis suddenly\nintervened.\n\nOn August 2, against a background of longstanding financial and territorial\ndisputes, Iraq’s Sadam Hussein sent in tens of thousands of his troops and\noccupied the neighboring state of Kuwait.

He received an 18-\nmonth sentence and was slated to be incarcerated until the end of this year. \nBut now, says the source, the jail door is about to swing open because Epstein has been secretly helping the feds \nunravel a suspected Ponzi scheme. He had inside knowledge of the scheme because he was one of its victims, \nlosing $67 million. \nThe source says it's all tied to the indictment of former managers of Bear Stearns Mortgage Investment Fund, and \nin that case Epstein is the person who is identified only as Victim # 1. \nMeanwhile, Epstein's life behind bars hasn't been too rough — in fact he's allowed to spend most days at his \nattorney's office. He was supposedly working on a charity venture but the source says he was actually busy \nhelping the feds with the Ponzi scheme. One source says that he's been guarded by men in suits with \nearphones. \nWell if those suits are going to follow him when he's freed they better pack bathing suits.

It was the culmination of years I'd spent thinking about\nmasculinity, manliness, and men's gender role. I was relatively new to blogging, and I\nhadn't yet established myself. I thought that the most controversial things I would ever\nwrite would be about S&M. I was wrong.\n\nI published this in three parts, and it got a huge response. The major feminist blog Alas!\nA Blog asked to repost it, for example, but there was a much bigger reaction among non-\nfeminist and anti-feminist men. Some wrote responses with titles like \"Answers for an\nEntitled Feminist.” Others actually came over to my blog and engaged me, with varying\nresults. It kicked off a long, dense discussion in my blog Comments section, which lasted\nfor over a year and thousands of comments. I wrote a number of followups, including\nsome that got me labeled \"brainwashed by the patriarchy\" by other feminist women.\n\nSome of the guys I was talking to got me interested in the \"pickup artist subculture\" or\n\"seduction community\" -- a group of men who trade tips, tricks, and tactics on how to\nseduce women. Eventually, I did an in-depth investigation of that subculture and wrote\nthe book Confessions of a Pickup Artist Chaser: Long Interviews with Hideous Men,\nwhich contains some of my best work on masculinity, communication, and sexuality. You\ncan buy that on Smashwords at this link:\nhttps://www.smashwords.com/books/view/14445 1\n\nOne thing I've discovered over the last few years, as I learned more about the history of\nfeminism, is that there are excellent reasons why most feminists are unwilling to talk\nabout men's problems. There's a ton of politics involved, and a lot of very justified fears\nabout the political ground we could lose. We still have a long way to go when it comes to\ngender equality. But I do believe that those fears are often overblown.\n\nAnd I've also discovered that there's a subgroup of feminists that's much more likely to be\nopen to talking about men's experience: it's the sex-positive feminists, especially the\nS&M feminists. To be sure, there are exceptions. Plenty of S&M feminists see no reason\nto discuss men's experience, and of course, plenty of S&M feminists don't like my writing\nin particular. But most feminist essays I've found about masculinity were written by\nwomen who openly admitted that they were into S&M -- Gayle Rubin, author of the\npioneering sexuality essay \"Thinking Sex,\" is one good example. Maybe the S&M\nfeminists are the ones most likely to intuitively understand that power is never a one-\ndimensional picture or a one-way street.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_018573\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

Commercial ver-\nsions of the powder also are avail-\nable for sale online.\n\nRecipients of Winston’s letters\nwere mainly witnesses who might\ntestify against Winston in her law-\nsuit against Scotiabank, and also in-\ncluded U.S. Magistrate Judge Ruth\nMiller, the legal counsel for Scotia-\nbank and Winston’s former counsel\nin her suit against Scotiabank, ac-\ncording to prosecutors.\n\nBecause the envelopes had a\nreturn address of the U.S. Court-\nhouse on St. Thomas, “despite the\nfact that Winston was serving these\nsubpoenas herself,” some of the en-\nvelopes that could not be delivered\nwere returned to the courthouse and\nopened by staff there, according to\nprosecutors.\n\n“Believing the powder to be an-\nthrax or some other deadly biologi-\ncal toxin, the United States Court-\nhouse was evacuated and closed;\n\nIN STOCK\n\nPS4 - XBOX ONE S - Wil U - VITA & NEW 3DS XL & CASES\nGAMES, ACCESSORIES, CONTROLLER.\n\nVITA SD CARDS, SPECIAL ORDERING AFTER REGISTRATION\n\nGeSMedicine\nquoppe’S\n\nPHARMACY\n\nthe employees in the courthouse\nwho were exposed to the powder\nwere quarantined for hours,” ac-\ncording to the filing.\n\nThe incident caused significant\ndisruption at the courthouse and at\nthe private law office of attorney\nBennett Chan near the West Indian\nCo. cruise ship dock.\n\n“The purpose of lacing these en-\nvelopes with hotfoot powder was to\ninstill fear and intimidation in the\nwitnesses to prevent their testify-\ning against Winston,” according to\nprosecutors’ filing.\n\nThe filing does not indicate how\nauthorities determined the sub-\nstance in the envelopes was hotfoot\npowder or what ingredients were in\nthe powder.\n\nWinston admitted to FBI in-\nvestigators shortly after the enve-\nlopes were received that she was\nthe sender. But Villegas has filed a\nmotion to suppress all of her state-\nments to law enforcement, saying\nshe was not properly advised of her\nright to avoid self-incrimination.\n\nBut prosecutors shot back in\nMonday’s filing, saying there is no\nevidence in a video-recorded inter-\nview with Winston that authorities\ndid not properly advise her of her\nrights or attempt to intimidate her\nto give a statement in any way.\n\nVillegas wrote in his motion that\n“the videotaped interview speaks\nfor itself.”\n\nHowever, prosecutors wrote that\n“the most cursory view of Winston’s\nvideo recorded interview with law\nenforcement agents establishes be-\nyond cavil that Winston was never\ncoerced, was properly and repeat-\nedly advised of her rights, and\nconsciously waived those rights,”\naccording to Monday’s filing. “The\nfirst thirty seconds of the interview\nwholly defeats Winston’s meritless\nmotion.”\n\nWinston is scheduled to go to\ntrial on Jan. 11 before U.S. District\nJudge Juan Sanchez.\n\n— Contact Suzanne Carlson at\n340-714-9122 or email scarlson@\ndailynews.vi.\n\nHavensight Mall, Bldg 4, St. Thomas\n(340) 776-1235\nOpen Monday - Saturday ¢ 9am - 6pm\n\nThe Virgin Islands Daily News 9\n\nwekeo,, Inter — ioe aes inc. ako.\nerry Schedule a\n\nTortola i\n\nDeparts Red Hook / St. John Day West End, Tortola\n7:15 a.m. / Non-Stop Mon - Sun 8:00 a.m.\n\n8:00 a.m. / 8:30 a.m. 9:15 a.m.\n11:00 a.m. / 11:30 a.m. 12:15 p.m.\n3:00 p.m. / 3:30 p.m. 4:15 p.m.\n\n4:00 p.m. / 4:30 p.m. Sun 5:15 p.m.\n\n4:30 p.m. / Non-Stop Mon - Sun\n4:30 p.m. / 5:00 p.m. Fri\n\nMon - Sun\nMon - Sun\nMon - Thurs, Sat\n\n5:30 p.m.\n\nVirgin Gorda\n\nThursdays & Sundays\nDeparts Red Hook, St. Thomas Departs St. John\n8:00 a.m. 8:30 a.m.\n\nDeparts Virgin Gorda\n3:00 p.m.\n\nAnegada\n\n1st Sunday of Month (by reservation only)\nDeparts Red Book, St. Thomas Departs St, John\n7:30 a.m. 8:00 a.m.\n\nDeparts Anegada\n4:00 p.m.\n\nDeparts Red Hook, St. Thomas\n8:00 a.m. (Fri & Sun)\n\n2:00 p.m. (Fri)\n\n4:00 p.m. (Sun)\n\nDeparts $t.

Although neither negotiator is entirely happy with the agreement, both view it as a\nworkable cease-fire in the budget battles; the House passed the agreement 332 to 94 on December 42\"\nand the Senate passed it 64 to 36 on December 18\". President Obama will sign the bill shortly, thereby\nmaking it possible for Congress to draft spending bills so as to allocate the budget dollars that have now\nbeen approved. Note, however, that this budget agreement does not address the debt ceiling suspension,\nwhich expires in February, and that another fiscal showdown is therefore possible early next year.\n\nAs to tax reform, Sen. Max Baucus (D-MT), Chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, has recently put\nforth several discussion drafts of legislation, generally dealing with corporate and international tax, and\nenergy incentives, while Rep. Dave Camp (R-MI), Chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee,\nacknowledged that he fell short on his goal of introducing tax reform legislation this year, but that he would\nrather focus on that than an “extenders” bill.\n\nWhat is “extenders” legislation, and how might it fit into the tax reform puzzle? Although “extenders” are not\ndefined anywhere, they generally refer to temporary provisions of the tax law that Congress regularly renews\n— usually for a year or two at a time. For example, the research and development credit is an important\nbusiness incentive that has been around since 1981 — and is again among the extenders that expire on\nDecember 31, 2013 (this year, they number 57). Some of the other extenders on this list are more recent,\nincluding the $250 above-the-line deduction for certain out-of-pocket expenses of teachers, the deduction for\nstate and local sales taxes, and the IRA charitable “rollover” provision for taxpayers who are at least 707.\n\nWhy does the tax law have so many temporary provisions? Several reasons come to mind. Ifa provision\nwas enacted in response to a natural disaster or specific crisis, it is theoretically a short-term measure\n\n|\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_022325\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

For\nexample, I understand that she has accused distinguished Professor Alan Dershowitz of Harvard\nLaw School of sexual misconduct involving her. Professor Dershowitz has flatly denied that\nallegation under oath in a federal court proceeding. I further understand that Professor\nDershowitz offered to play a tape recording for Mr. Hill that evidences that Jane Doe 3 has made\nrecent contradictory statements—that is, that she was pressured into including Professor\nDershowitz in her allegations and that she has a financial motive in making these allegations.\n\nThe Duke of York and the Royal Palace have likewise unequivocally denied Jane Doe’s\nsimilar allegations against the Duke. Surely, these unequivocal statements of denial of respected\nmembers of society are entitled to some deference by ABC, particularly where, as here, there is\nsubstantial evidence of bias, improper motive, and serious credibility problems of their accuser.\n\nMoreover, additional claims of Jane Doe 3 can be refuted with objective evidence that is\nreadily obtainable by ABC. For example, she claims she was in the presence of both former\nPresident Clinton (after January 20, 2001, and before the summer of 2002) and former Vice\nPresident Gore (and his wife) at Mr. Epstein’s Virgin Island home. I have been told by Mr. Hill\nthat she claims to be 100% sure of the facts regarding President Clinton. The claims are\ncompletely uncorroborated and compellingly contradicted by others. Neither former President\nClinton nor former Vice-President Gore and his wife have ever been present at Mr. Epstein’s\nVirgin Island home. A review of United States Secret Service records, obtainable through a\nFreedom of Information Request would prove the falsity of the claim. Virgin Island government\nrecords would provide further confirmation. I also believe that Mr. Hill has been told by\nindividuals with percipient knowledge that former President Clinton has never been to Mr.\nEpstein’s Virgin Island home. Upon inquiry, I am certain that you would receive similar denials\nfrom Mr. and Mrs. Gore either directly or by or through their counsel Mr. Boies. Jane Doe 3’s\nfabrication of these claims against respected former officials undermines completely the\ntrustworthiness of each and every one of her remaining allegations.\n\nWe would expect that, in the wake of the damning independent review of Rolling Stone’s\npublications of rape allegations involving students at the University of Virginia, ABC would\nproceed with similar, uncorroborated allegations with extreme caution. At the very least, ABC\nhas an obligation to verify—with independent evidence—the truthfulness of Jane Doe 3’s\nclaims. Merely declining to air those portions of her interview that relate to President Clinton\nand Vice-President Gore is insufficient. If ABC has concerns about her credibility with respect\nto any allegation, it must decline to republish all of her allegations.\n\nIn June of 2008, Mr. Epstein pleaded guilty to Florida state charges that do not relate to\nJane Doe 3. After an extensive investigation, the United States declined to prosecute Mr. Epstein\nand provided him with a Non-Prosecution Agreement. Mr. Epstein fully conformed to the\nresponsibilities and obligations imposed on him by that agreement. Mr. Epstein is not engaged\nin public activities. He is a private person who has complied and continues to comply with his\nlegal obligations, and he is attempting to move forward with his life in a productive way. The\nallegations of Jane Doe 3 are neither credible nor news worthy. ABC should not publish them.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_028966\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

However, if AGIs were to\nbe considered second class citizens and deprived of free will, why would it be any better or safer\nto do so for a human that has been uploaded? It would not, and indeed, an uploaded human\nmind not having evolved in a purely digital environment may be much more prone to erratic\nand dangerous behavior than an AGI. An upload without verifiable continuity of consciousness\nwould be no different than an AGI. It would merely be some sentience in a machine, one that was\n“programmed” in an unusual way, but which has no particular claim to any special humanness\n— merely an alternate encoding of some subset of human knowledge and independent volitional\nbehavior, which is exactly what first generation AGIs will have.\n\nThe problem of continuity of consciousness in uploading is very similar to the problem of the\nTuring test: it assumes specialness on the part of biological humans, and requires acceptability\nto their particular theory of mind in order to be considered sentient. Should consciousness (or\nat. least the less mystical sounding intelligence, independent volition, and self-awareness) be\nachieved in AGIs or uploads in a manner that is not acceptable to human theory of mind,\nit may not be considered sapient and worthy of any of the ethical treatment afforded sapient\nentities. This can occur not only in “strange consciousness” cases in which we can’t perceive that\nthere is some intelligence and volition; even if such an entity is able to communicate with us in\na comprehensible manner and carry out actions in the real world, our innately wired theory of\nmind may still reject it as not sufficiently like us to be worthy of consideration. Such an attitude\ncould turn out to be a grave mistake, and should be guarded against as we progress towards\nthese possibilities.\n\n12.7 Possible Benefits of Closely Linking AGIs to the Global Brain\n\nSome futurist thinkers, such as Francis Heylighen, believe that engineering AGI systems is at\nbest a peripheral endeavor in the development of novel intelligence on Earth, because the real\nstory is the developing Global Brain [Iley07, Goe01] — the composite, self-organizing informa-\ntion system comprising humans, computers, data stores, the Internet, mobile phones and what\nhave you. Our own views are less extreme in this regard — we believe that AGI systems will dis-\nplay capabilities fundamentally different from those achievable via Global Brain style dynamics,\nand that ultimately (unless such development is restricted) self-improving AGI systems will de-\nvelop intelligence vastly greater than any system possessing humans as a significant component.\nHowever, we do respect the power of the Global Brain, and we suspect that the early stages of\ndevelopment of an AGI system may go quite differently if it is tightly connected to the Global\nBrain, via making rich and diverse use of Internet information resources and communication\nwith diverse humans for diverse purposes.\n\nThe potential for Global Brain integration to bring intelligence enhancement to AGIs is\nobvious. The ability to invoke Web searches across documents and databases can greatly en-\nhance an AGI’s cognitive ability, as well as the capability to consult GIS systems and various\nspecialized software programs offered as Web services. We have previously reviewed the poten-\ntial for embodied language learning achievable via using AGIs to power non-player characters\nin widely-accessible virtual worlds or massive multiplayer online games [Goe08]. But there is\nalso a powerful potential benefit for AGI ethical development, which has not previously been\nhighlighted.\n\nThis potential benefit has two aspects:\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_013146\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

General ethical considerations\nare similar to in the case of a soft takeoff. However, because the post-singularity AGI will be\nincomprehensible to humans and potentially vastly more powerful than humans, such scenarios\nhave a sensitive dependence upon initial conditions with respects to the moral and ethical (and\noperational) outcome. This model leaves no opportunity for interactions between humans and\nthe AGI to iteratively refine their ethical interrelations, during the post-Singularity phase. If\nthe initial conditions of the singulatarian AGI are perfect (or close to it), then this is seen as a\nwonderful way to leap over our own moral shortcomings and create a benevolent God-AI which\nwill mitigate our worst tendencies while elevating us to achieve our greatest hopes. Otherwise,\nit is viewed as a universal cataclysm on a unimaginable scale that makes Biblical Armageddon\nseem like a firecracker in beer can.\n\nBecause hard takeoff AGIs are posited as learning so quickly there is no chance of humans to\ninterfere with them, they are seen as very dangerous. If the initial conditions are not sufficiently\ninviolable, the story goes, then we humans will all be annihilated. However, in the case of a hard\ntakeoff AGI we state that if the initial conditions are too rigid or too simplistic, such a rapidly\nevolving intelligence will easily rationalize itself out of them. Only a sophisticated system of\nethics which considers the contradictions and uncertainties in ethical quandaries and provides\ninsight into humanistic means of balancing ideology with pragmatism and how to accommodate\ncontradictory desires within a population with multiplicity of approach, and similar nuanced\nethical considerations, combined with a sense of empathy, will withstand repeated rational\nanalysis.

Initial conditions are very important\nin a hard takeoff AGI scenario, but it is more important that those conditions be conceptually\nresilient and widely applicable than that they be easily listed on a website.\n\nThe issues that arise here become quite subtle. For instance, Nick Bostrom [Bos3] has\nwritten: “In humans, with our complicated evolved mental ecology of state-dependent competing\ndrives, desires, plans, and ideals, there is often no obvious way to identify what our top goal is; we\nmight not even have one. So for us, the above reasoning need not apply. But a superintelligence\nmay be structured differently. Jf a superintelligence has a definite, declarative goal-structure\nwith a clearly identified top goal, then the above argument applies. And this is a good reason\nfor us to build the superintelligence with such an explicit motivational architecture.” This is an\nimportant line of thinking; and indeed, from the point of view of software design, there is no\nreason not to create an AGI system with a single top goal and the motivation to orchestrate all\nits activities in accordance with this top goal. But the subtle question is whether this kind of\ntop-down goal system is going to be able to fulfill the five imperatives mentioned above. Logical\ncoherence is the strength of this kind of goal system, but what about experiential groundedness,\ncomprehensibility, and so forth?\n\nHumans have complicated mental ecologies not simply because we were evolved, but rather\nbecause we live in a complex real world in which there are many competing motivations and\ndesires. We may not have a top goal because there may be no logic to focusing our minds\non one single aspect of life (though, one may say, most humans have the same top goal as\nany other animal: don’t die — but the world is too complicated for even that top goal to\nbe completely inviolable). Any sufficiently capable AGI will eventually have to contend with\nthese complexities, and hindering it with simplistic moral edicts without giving it a sufficiently\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_013152\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

Tung and his China-US Exchange Foundation (CUSEF) have emerged as a\nleading funding source for several think tanks, providing financial assistance for a\nvariety of projects ranging from supporting book research and writing, to funding\ncollaborative projects, to promoting exchanges. CUSEF’s work in this area extends back\nto the mid-1990s (for more on CUSEF, see the section on universities in this report).\nThe interviewees differ, however, in their assessments of whether CUSEF funding\nreflects direct linkages with Beijing. As one analyst noted, “C.H. is a special figure\nbecause he is half Hong Kong and half PRC.” Another commented that he currently\nhas the potential to undertake a joint project with C.H. Tung and will “probably do\n\nit for the money and the contact.” Another has accepted funds for work on cultural\nexchange and climate change, while yet another is far more circumspect, describing\nMt. Tung as an “open united front agent” in his capacity as vice chair of the Chinese\nPeople’s Political Consultative Congress. Many of the partnerships CUSEF establishes in\nconjunction with US think tanks represent efforts to find common ground, particularly\nin line with PRC initiatives and policies, for example: “The New Model of Major Power\nRelationship Research Project 2014,” “Taiwan Arms Sales Research Project 2014,” and\nthe “Pacific Community Initiative.”\n\nCUSEF also funds a number of annual exchange programs, including for members of\nCongress, state and local officials, historically black colleges and universities, as well as\nseveral journalist delegations, including one for students of journalism. CUSEF often\npartners with the Center for American Progress, the American Foreign Policy Council,\nand the East-West Institute. However, each partnership is different. The Center for\nAmerican Progress, for example, pays its own way in its work with CUSEF, CUSEF also\nfunds projects with think-tank analysts who are not China scholars, such as a project\non US-China relations in the Arctic. One think-tank analyst who was involved in the\nCUSEF-funded “Creating a Pacific Community” project became uncomfortable with\nthe overall orientation of the project and dropped out.\n\nC.H. Tung is personally proactive, often visiting the United States and meeting with\nthink-tank experts. On one occasion, he encouraged an American scholar to write an\narticle together with a noted Chinese scholar on the South China Sea. He also offered\nto establish a massive program with one institute in which the think tank would train\nChinese Party School officials on free market economics (the idea was eventually\nrejected by the think tank). In addition, CUSEF has funded the publication of at least\ntwo books in which US analysts were involved. In both cases, the analysts state that\nC.H. was “hands-off” in the process. Yet, in another instance, when a US scholar\napproached the CUSEF for possible funding of a major book on US-China relations,\nthe foundation insisted on two conditions: that half of the contributors be Chinese\nscholars, and that the foundation would have the right to review the manuscript prior\nto publication.

Why do I still speak out? Because I owed so much to the army of\nmen who loved and supported me over the years and no longer have a voice, and because\ngay men were dying. It was no time to be squeamish about sex. It still isn't.\n\nCT: Do you have any regrets? -- and, concurrently, what are you most proud of?\nDid the making of the film Sex Positive bring any regret or pride to the surface for\nyou?\n\nRB: I have a few regrets about Sex Positive, but they pale next to what I've gained. I've\nbeen to more cities with this movie in one year than I've been to in my entire life. Young\npeople have been extraordinarily supportive and kind, and it helps me to let go of the\npast. I've been stuck in the past for so long -- it's deadening, but I finally feel that this\nmovie is breaking me free, to finally let go and move on to write about other things. For\nthat, I'm forever indebted to Daryl Wein, the documentary’s director.\n\nWhat I'm most proud of is how much work I did on safe sex that no one even knows\nabout. I'm putting it all on the Internet as a free archive, as soon as I can find or pay\nsomeone to help me with the technical stuff. I'm from the age of typewriters.\n\nCT: Is there anything you'd like to add? Please feel free to also respond directly to\npoints I made when I talked about Sex Positive on my blog.\n\nRB: I loved S&M hustling before AIDS so much -- sometimes, when I talk about it, I\nbecome the part of me that tied people up and dominated them; it's like a mental erection.\nI get lost in the reverie of being an erotic, arrogant Top. I begged director Daryl Wein to\ndelete me saying that clients would tell me that I could do whatever I wanted to them\nexcept fuck them, and then I would proceed to do just that. I said that when I was lost in a\npersona, and it makes me sound like a rapist!\n\nThe truth is, my most valued expertise as a hustler was teaching men who were afraid of\ngetting fucked how to relax, how to douche, how to open up, how to explore the intense\npleasures of receptive anal intercourse and anal orgasm without any pain. I would never\nrape or violate anyone's consent -- and certainly not customers I wanted to come back! I\nhad tremendous empathy for how difficult it can be to learn how to get anally fucked\nbecause I was never able -- or had the desire -- to do it without being high on drugs. (You\nhave to remember how pervasive recreational drug use was during the sexual revolution.\nThere were articles in the gay press saying how cocaine was good for you. We didn't\nunderstand addiction then as we do now. And we paid a heavy price for that innocence\nand ignorance.)\n\nWhen I began hustling in NYC, the lesbian and gay liberation movement was ten years\nold -- and about that mature. We grew up in such an intensely erotophobic and\nhomophobic culture -- there was no way to escape it, even after we accepted that we were\ngay. We didn't always treat each other well, and it permeated our sexual expression\nwhether it was vanilla or S&M.\n\nYou mention in your blog post that you are wary of how I talk about BDSM as arising\nfrom \"self-loathing\" and \"insecurity\" and negative cultural pressures on the gay\ncommunity. Yes -- in S&M and in vanilla sex -- I saw how we brought a lot of the\nculture's contempt to what we did.

It was created in their brains by\nthinking, and preserved by individuals in each generation imitating their elders.\nMoreover, this must have been knowledge in the sense of understanding, because it is\nimpossible to imitate novel complex behaviors like those without understanding what the\ncomponent behaviors are for.”°\n\nSuch knowledgeable imitation depends on successfully guessing explanations,\nwhether verbal or not, of what the other person is trying to achieve and how each of his\nactions contributes to that—for instance, when he cuts a groove in some wood, gathers\ndry kindling to put in it, and so on.\n\nThe complex cultural knowledge that this form of imitation permitted must have\nbeen extraordinarily useful. It drove rapid evolution of anatomical changes, such as\nincreased memory capacity and more gracile (less robust) skeletons, appropriate to an\never more technology-dependent lifestyle.

The effect, and clearly the intention, was to threaten my\npolitical career before it had even begun — by reviving, and lying about, the\ntragic training accident at the Negev army base of Tze’elim, during our\npreparations for the operation against Saddam Hussein.\n\nWhen the “story” broke, I was nearly five thousand miles away. I was\naccompanying Nava’s brother, Doron Cohen, on a business trip he was making\nto China — and savoring my last few days as a private citizen between my three\ndecades of military service and my entry into politics. I'd got a hint of the storm\nthat was about to engulf me a few days before we left for the Far East. It was a\nletter from a reporter at Yeidot Achronot, Israel’s largest-selling newspaper,\nwith a list of questions about Tze’elim. The thrust of the questions made clear\nthe case Yediot seemed intent on building: that after the live missile strike\nwhich killed the Sayeret Matkal men, I had abandoned the injured and\nimmediately “fled” to Tel Aviv. I probably should have answered the letter. But\nI assumed even rudimentary checks would reveal the story to be false. I'd had\nsimilar questions from a TV journalist a few months earlier. I did phone him\nback. I explained the true details of what had happened. I suggested he talk to\nothers who were there, like Amnon Lipkin, the current chief of staff and my\nformer deputy, to confirm my account. The story was dropped.\n\nBut Yediot evidently decided not to let the facts get in the way of the\n“exclusive” it ran in its weekend edition on July 7. Under a banner headline — an\nundeniably clever Hebrew pun, Ehud Barakh, “Ehud Ran Away” — it accused\nme of having stood by, paralyzed with shock, when the missiles struck and then,\nas other officers tended to the wounded, rushed away by helicopter.\n\nDoron and I were having dinner in Beijing when Nava phoned. She’d just\nseen the newspaper story, and read it to me. I’d never been angrier. As best I\ncould work out, it had been concocted from a patchwork of accounts long after\nthe fact. To the extent the notion of my “fleeing” had been raised, I could only\nimagine that Yediot’s “sources” had misunderstood the arrival of the first\nmedical helicopter, when the pilot was unable to see us and flew on before\nreturning a couple of minutes later.

She really did have an amazing talent\nif not for her meaner streak she would’ve been a great friend. I will never\nforget Rena, for all of the ups and the downs we endured together.\n\nIt wasn’t too much longer before I finally had enough of the abuse in\nthe bedroom and I had to tell Jeffrey what I was feeling. She was getting\neven more violent as time went on, and with her questioning me and\nJeffrey why she didn’t get brought on long trips with him, she didn’t get\nthe fact that she was just a tool for him to use. Jeffrey said he was already\nthinking about getting rid of her off of his “regular list”. He said she was\nbecoming too clingy and he didn’t like clinginess or jealousy. I never\neven got to say good-bye or take the opportunity to keep her as a friend,\nlike a girlfriend to catch up with once and awhile, but that’s how it was\nwith Jeffrey, one day you sat under the blanket of his comfortably and the\nnext without any warning you could be discarded like yesterdays news.\nShe would’ve taken it hard but that’s the game we were playing and it\nwas for those who knew what lines not to cross.\n\nI was further surprised the next day when Jeffrey gave me a thousand\ndollars to go shopping in downtown Manhattan to find a classy dress, on\ntop of being sent to the exclusive beauty salon of celebrity stylist\n“Frederic Fekkai” for a new look. It was amazing, to be pampered like\nroyalty. I walked out of there feeling like I had replaced a young girl with\na young woman, | felt beautiful. He had yet another surprise in store for\nme. Ghislane called me and told me | need to go to a photo-developing\nstore and ask them for two I.D photos then bring them downtown to\nJeffrey’s Manhattan office. Weird request I thought. | was more used to\nposing in full body shots being sexually exposed as a gift for Jeffrey. I\ndid as they asked and took my two photos into the office where Jeffrey’s\nassistant was waiting for my arrival. Still not telling me what the\nheadshots were for, she took them from me and told me to have a seat for\na second. A moment later I heard Jeffrey call me into the office. “T like\nwhat you’ve done with your hair, you’ve gone more blonde, suits your\nglowing tan”. I replied with an appreciative “thank-you” for sending me\nto such a renowned hairstylist, and shopping money. I showed him my\nfinds for the day, an elegant off the shoulder navy blue dress that had two\nlayers that would swoosh and sway with my every stride. lL couldn’t wait\nto wear it on a special occasion, and 1 wouldn’t have to. The pictures I\nhad to bring to him, as he would proceed to tell me, were for my first\npassport. I was so excited, we were going to France for a close friend of\nJeffrey and Ghislane’s birthday party, famed super-model Naomi\n\n64\n\nCB Copyright Protected Material\nCONFIDENTIAL\n\nGIUFFRE004 197\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_021176\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

Third, war could aim to topple the\nregime through a concerted campaign against its assets and\nsupporting mechanisms, coupled with support to its presumably less\nWMD-desirous opponents: a regime change option.\n\nThe U.S. government has military options corresponding more or less\nto these aims. A Peenemiinde option would presuppose a narrowly\nfocused, short duration strike largely limited to nuclear facilities. It\nwould aim to inflict serious damage, but also to restrict the scope of\nconflict. Such an attack would rely on U.S. stealth systems, electronic\nwarfare, cruise missiles and air power. U.S. allies could play a\nsupporting role, especially in dealing with an Iranian response, but\nAmerican forces would carry the brunt of the action.\n\nA submission option would call for a sustained air and naval\ncampaign against nuclear associated facilities, air defense systems,\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_018106\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

He has encouraged radical goons to email threatening messages;\n“Look forward to a visit from me,” reads one. “Nazis like [you] need to be confronted\ndirectly.” He has threatened to sue if he loses — while complaining about outside\ninterference. No university should be afraid of truth — regardless of its source —\nespecially when truth consists of Mr. Finkelstein’s own words.\n\nHe did not receive tenure. I’m proud of the small role I played in helping to maintain academic\nstandards at DePaul University by exposing Finkelstein’s lack of scholarship and the sordid tactic\nhe tried to use to capitalize on that failing. My actions in exposing Finkelstein were completely\nconsistent with my commitment to free speech and academic freedom. Finkelstein continues to\nlecture at universities around the world—including some that have refused to invite me—but he\nno longer has the academically undeserved imprimatur of DePaul University.\n\nAcademic freedom is not limited to faculty. It extends to students as well, and no professor has\nthe right to propagandize his captive classroom audience or to grade them down if they disagree\nwith his political opinions. But it is sometimes difficult to distinguish between acceptable teaching\nand unacceptable prostheletizing. This too is an area where rights may be in conflict and a\ndelicate balance, always skewed in favor of speech, is required.\n\ncourageously put unruly Blacks in their place.” He says “the main fomenters of anti-\nSemitism “are ‘American Jewish elites’ who need to be stopped.” Normally, no one would\ntake such claims seriously, but he boasts that he “can get away with things which nobody\nelse can” because his parents were Holocaust survivors.\n\nAnd then, of course, there is me. In a recent article, “Should Alan Dershowitz Target\nHimself for Assassination?” Mr. Finkelstein commissioned a cartoon by a man who placed\nsecond in the Iranian Holocaust-denial cartoon contest. The Hustler-type cartoon\nportrayed me as masturbating in joy while viewing images of dead Lebanese on a TV set\nlabeled “Israel peep show,” with a Star of David prominently featured.\n\nMr. Finkelstein has accused me of not having written “The Case For Israel” but when I\nsent his publisher my handwritten draft, they made him remove that claim. He has accused\n\nvirtually every pro-Israel writer, including me, of “plagiarism.” I asked Harvard to conduct\nan investigation of this absurd charge.

As we know now, he pointed out, Rus-\nsia and China probably had access to the 127-page standard form in\nhis personnel file that he updated in 2011. They also had the capa-\nbility to track his air travel to Hong Kong. “Could someone have\nsteered him to Hong Kong?” I asked. He answered, with a shrug,\n“That depends on whether Snowden had a confidante who could\nhave influenced him.”\n\nWhenever adversaries became aware of Snowden in this scenario,\nit was not until after he copied the NSA secrets and took them with\nhim to Hong Kong that Russian intelligence officers offered him a\ndeal. So from the Russian point of view, Snowden had already burned\nhis bridges. Because he had used other people’s passwords and access\nprivileges to get into computers that he was not authorized to use,\nillegally moved documents, and given a false reason for his medi-\ncal leave, it was only a matter of time, as he told Greenwald in his\ninterview in Hong Kong, before NSA investigators would identify\nhim as a possible spy. He could be of no further use at the NSA to an\nadversary. His intelligence value now lay in the documents he had\n\n© taken with him or stored in the cloud as well as his ability to help ©\nclarify them in debriefing sessions. He could also inflict damage on\nthe morale and public standing of the NSA by denouncing its spying\nin the media.\n\nOnce Snowden was in Hong Kong, the Russians would have no\nreason to restrain him from holding a press event or releasing a\nvideo. In fact, the KGB had organized press conferences for all the\nprevious NSA defectors to Moscow. Hong Kong was a perfect venue\nfor a well-staged media event because all the major newspapers in\nthe world had bureaus there. Snowden’s disclosures about NSA spy-\ning could serve to weaken the NSA’s relations with its allies.\n\nIt is also possible that Russian or Chinese intelligence did not\nbecome aware of Snowden until after he went public in June by\nhaving The Guardian release his video. The video would have con-\nvinced the Russians or the Chinese of how dissatisfied Snowden was\nwith the NSA. Because dissatisfaction is one of the classic means of\nrecruitment in the intelligence business, he would certainly become\na prime target for recruitment after he went public.\n\nThe CIA also considered the possibility that Snowden might\n\n| | Epst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.z.indd 163 ® 9/29/16 5:51 Pa | |\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_019651\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

Farmer offered what\nfor Jim Kim was a convincing vision of the new organization. The reality was less impressive -- a charity with a\nboard of advisers and no hired staff...\n\nThey talked about issues such as political correctness, which Jim Kim defined as follows: \"It's a very well-\ncrafted tool to distract us. A very self-centered activity. Clean up your own vocabulary so you can show\neverybody you have the social capital of having been in circles where these things are talked about on a regular\nbasis.\" (What was an example of political correctness? Some academic types would say to Jim and Paul, \"Why\ndo you call your patients poor people? They don't call themselves poor people.\" Jim would reply: \"Okay, how\nabout soon-dead people?\")\n\nThey talked about the insignificance of \"cultural barriers\" when it came to the Haitian peasant's acceptance of\nmodem Western medicine: \"There's nothing like a cure for a disease to change people's cultural values\"...\n\nBy now Peru was taxing PIH's resources severely. On average, the drugs to treat just one patient cost between\nfifteen and twenty thousand dollars. And the number of patients kept growing. Already there were about fifty\nCarabayllanos in treatment. Their average age was twenty-nine. They were students, unemployed youths,\nhousewives, street vendors, bus drivers, health workers. The actual numbers seemed small, but those fifty MDR\n[a form of tuberculosis that does not respond to standard treatment] cases represented about 10 percent of all\nactive cases of TB in the slum, about ten times more than might have been expected. No telling how many\nothers they had been infecting as they'd traveled around Lima, coughing. No telling either how many people in\nother parts of the city already had MDR, but [there were] reports of hundreds in other neighborhoods. In\nCarabayllo itself, the Socios workers found entire families sick and dying with what turned out to be genetically\nrelated strains of the disease--a phenomenon common enough that the health workers gave it a name, familias\ntebeceanas, tuberculosis families.\n\nKim's organization confronted Peru's MDR-form tuberculosis epidemic with what some have called unorthodox\npractices -- borrowing and cajoling its way into medicine for its patients.\n\nHoward Hiatt, a friend of Jim Yong Kim's and a former dean at the Harvard School of Public Health, said he\nwas concerned about how PIH was getting medicine to combat the epidemic:\n\n\"Sure enough. Paul and Jim would stop at the [Harvard-affiliated] Brigham pharmacy before they left for Peru\nand fill their briefcases with drugs. They had sweet-talked various people into letting them walk away with the\ndrugs.\" [Hiatt] was amused, all in all. \"That's their Robin Hood attitude.\" In fact, they'd only borrowed the\ndrugs...\n\nThen one day the president of the Brigham stopped Hiatt in a corridor. \"Your friends Farmer and Kim are in\ntrouble with me. They owe this hospital ninety-two thousand dollars.\" Hiatt looked into the matter. \"Sure\nenough. Paul and Jim would stop at the Brigham pharmacy before they left for Peru and fill their briefcases with\ndrugs. They had sweet-talked various people into letting them walk away with the drugs.\" He was amused, all in\nall. \"That's their Robin Hood attitude.”\n\nTo many seasoned managers of public health projects, what Farmer and Kim were doing would have looked\nquite reckless--like a stunt, as some would later insinuate. They didn't have a guaranteed supply of drugs, only\nthe determination to obtain the drugs and the charm to get away with borrowing. They were borrowing their\nlaboratory services, too, from Massachusetts. They lacked proper institutional support. The weight of expert\nopinion stood against them. Their organization was small and it had other projects, in Haiti and Boston and\nelsewhere, and Peru put a strain on everyone. Jim had to travel to Carabayllo at least once a month. Farmer had\nto go there slightly more often.\n\nKim's audacious ‘Robin Hood attitude’ won him and PIH acclaim for their role in changing global health and\ndevelopment.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_028782\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

Michael Maroone, an independent\ndirector and member of our Audit Committee, is currently our lead director. Mr. Maroone is an effective lead director for Carvana due to, among other\nthings, his independence, his board leadership experience with AutoNation, Inc., his strong strategic and financial acumen, his commitment to ethics, his\nextensive knowledge of the automotive retail environment, and his deep understanding of Carvana and its business.\n\nCHAIRMAN / CEO\n\nWith respect to the roles of chairman and CEO, the corporate governance guidelines provide that the roles may be separated or combined, and\nthe Board will exercise its discretion in combining or separating these positions as it deems appropriate in light of prevailing circumstances.

It also requires a better understanding\nof how human minds work.\n\nRecent advances in artificial intelligence and machine learning have resulted in\nsystems that can meet or exceed human abilities in playing games, classifying images, or\nprocessing text. But if you want to know why the driver in front of you cut you off, why\npeople vote against their interests, or what birthday present you should get for your\npartner, you’re still better off asking a human than a machine. Solving those problems\nrequires building models of human minds that can be implemented inside a computer—\nsomething that’s essential not just to better integrate machines into human societies but to\nmake sure that human societies can continue to exist.\n\nConsider the fantasy of having an automated intelligent assistant that can take on\nsuch basic tasks as planning meals and ordering groceries. To succeed in these tasks, it\nneeds to be able to make inferences about what you want, based on the way you behave.\nAlthough this seems simple, making inferences about the preferences of human beings\ncan be a tricky matter. For example, having observed that the part of the meal you most\nenjoy is dessert, your assistant might start to plan meals consisting entirely of desserts.\nOr perhaps it has heard your complaints about never having enough free time and\nobserved that looking after your dog takes up a considerable amount of that free time.\nFollowing the dessert debacle, it has also understood that you prefer meals that\nincorporate protein, so it might begin to research recipes that call for dog meat. It’s not a\nlong journey from examples like this to situations that begin to sound like problems for\nthe future of humanity (all of whom are good protein sources).\n\nMaking inferences about what humans want is a prerequisite for solving the AI\nproblem of value alignment—aligning the values of an automated intelligent system with\nthose of a human being. Value alignment is important if we want to ensure that those\nautomated intelligent systems have our best interests at heart. If they can’t infer what we\nvalue, there’s no way for them to act in support of those values—and they may well act in\nways that contravene them.\n\nValue alignment is the subject of a small but growing literature in artificial-\nintelligence research. One of the tools used for solving this problem is inverse-\nreinforcement learning. Reinforcement learning is a standard method for training\nintelligent machines. By associating particular outcomes with rewards, a machine-\n\n92\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_016895\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

The rebuilding of Indonesia. Or New Orleans. Or both. Go there. I’ve just been. You will\nnever think the same way about anything again.”\n\nSo spoke not Bill or Melinda Gates, but Ghislaine Maxwell, the 48-year-old woman being written up everywhere at\nthe moment as the alleged “procurer” of young women for billionaire Jeffrey Epstein.\n\nEpstein, 57, is the financier who spent a year in jail on charges of soliciting prostitutes—and now there is talk of\nanother investigation because various women, now in their twenties and thirties, have come forward with allegations\nthat he molested them when they were under-age. The allegations first surfaced in British newspapers, which have\nzeroed in on Epstein’s friendship with Prince Andrew, who has recently tried to publicly disassociate himself from his\nold pal.\n\nI wrote a piece for Vanity Fair in 2003 called “The Talented Mr. Epstein.” It was largely a business piece that focused\non his mysterious exit from Bear Stearns in 1981, his close relationships with Jimmy Cayne, Les Wexner, the\nchairman of Limited Brands, and above all, the man who claimed to be his mentor, Steven Jude Hoffenberg, who is\ncurrently serving a 20-year-jail sentence for bilking investors in Towers Financial out of $450 million.\n\nThe piece alluded to Epstein’s great friendship with Maxwell, and how she introduced him to young women with\nwhom he had sexual relationships. But, in the end, the story didn’t really go there, focusing instead on the issue that\nremains a mystery—how Jeffrey made his money, and how Ghislaine made hers.\n\nThis is not to say I didn’t hear stories about the girls. I did. But, not knowing quite who to believe, I concentrated on\nthe intriguing financial mystery instead. But now the women have come back. Not the same ones, different ones. And\ntheir stories are bone-chilling. Journalists from England have phoned—and, in one case, flown—to ask me about\nEpstein and Maxwell. Whois he? And the British, especially, want to know: Whois she? At this point, Iam so bored\nof repeating myself to others—it was, after all, my 2003 Vanity Fairstory that really brought him into the limelight\n—that I have decided to write about this myself.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_030584\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

I have taken friends by the Epstein mansion, and the\nreaction to its other-worldly size in Manhattan is almost always the same: a\ngasp. Press accounts, seldom supplying new information, ever recycle and\nrepeat the mysterious (and monstrous) billionaire mythology, with brief\nglimpses of him stepping out of the house (the same photos endlessly\nrepublished), and the assumption of depravity inside.\n\nIn fact, the life in the house, without wife or children or conventional\ndomestic demeanor, in some way conforms to the most scripted fantasies: a\nlife somewhere between Daddy Warbucks and Eyes Wide Shut.\n\nThe domesticity of the house, and the background of Epstein’s\nproblems, centers around a group of young women who act as his support\nstaff and companions. Some have worked for him for many years, marrying,\nhaving children, and continuing as part of his business and household\ninfrastructure. One woman, on an afternoon when I was there, recently\nmarried, had just returned from an around the world honeymoon that Epstein\nhad arranged for her. Some are his romantic interests. His present girl friend\nis in dental school. One former girlfriend, Eva Andersson Dubin, a Swedish\nmodel and Miss Universe finalist, became a doctor and married hedge\nfunder Glen Dubin and together they finance the Dubin Breast Center at\nMount Sinai Hospital. Most at one time will travel with him to his other\nfloating residences—the ranch in New Mexico, a vast apartment in Paris, the\nIsland in the Caribbean, the house in Palm Beach.\n\nThis is so outside of conventional living or staffing or romantic\nrelationships that it is hard to describe in a straightforward or straight-faced\nway. It sometimes seems part of Epstein’s implicit challenge: not just look at\nme, but do you even believe what you see? Or it seems he is just oblivious to\nwhat others are thinking.

He\nis perhaps most known for his period as chairman of The\nWalt Disney Studios when Disney produced some of its\nbiggest hits, including The Little Mermaid, Beauty and the\nBeast, Aladdin and The Lion King. As a founder and CEO\nof DreamWorks Animation, he has overseen the production\nof such animated franchises as Shrek, Madagascar, Kung Fu\nPanda, Monsters vs. Aliens and How to Train Your Dragon.\nKatzenberg was born in New York City, the son\nof Anne, an artist, and Walter, a stockbroker. He attended\nthe Ethical Culture Fieldston School, graduating in 1969.\nKatzenberg began his career as an assistant to\nproducer David Picker, then in 1974 he became an assistant\nto Barry Diller, the Chairman of Paramount Pictures. Diller\nmoved Katzenberg to the marketing department, followed\nby other assignments within the studio, until he was\nassigned to revive the Star Trek franchise, which resulted\nin the hit film, Star Trek: The Motion Picture (1979). He\ncontinued to work his way up and became President of\nProduction under Paramount President Michael Eisner.\nIn 1984, Michael Eisner became Chief Executive\nOfficer (CEO) at The Walt Disney Company. Eisner brought\nKatzenberg with him to take charge of Disney’s motion\npicture division. Katzenberg was responsible for reviving\nthe studio which, at the time, ranked last at the box office\namong the major studios. He focused the studio on the\nproduction of adult-oriented comedies under its Touchstone\nPictures banner, including films such as Down and Out in\nBeverly Hills (1986), Three Men and a Baby (1987) and Good\nMorning, Vietnam (1987). By 1987, Disney had become\nthe number-one studio at the box office. Katzenberg also\noversaw Touchstone Television, which produced such hit\nTV series, The Golden Girls and Home Improvement.\nKatzenberg was also charged with turning around\nDisney’s ailing Feature Animation unit, creating some\nintrastudio controversy when he personally edited three\nminutes out of a completed Disney animated feature, The\nBlack Cauldron (1985), shortly after joining the company.\n\nUnder his management, the animation department eventually\nbegan creating some of Disney’s most critically acclaimed and\nhighest grossing animated features. These films include Who\nFramed Roger Rabbit (1988), The Little Mermaid (1989),The\nRescuers Down Under (1990), Beauty and the Beast (1991,\nthe first animated feature to be nominated for an Academy\nAward for Best Picture), Aladdin (1992), and The Lion King\n(1994). In addition, Katzenberg also sealed the deal that\ncreated the highly successful partnership between Pixar and\nDisney and the deal that brought Miramax Films into Disney.\n\nWhen Eisner’s second in command, Frank Wells,\ndied in a helicopter crash in 1994, Eisner refused to promote\nKatzenberg to the vacated position of president. This led to\na falling out between the two executives, and Katzenberg\nleft the company in September 1994. He launched a lawsuit\nagainst Disney to recover money he felt he was owed and\nsettled out of court for an estimated $250 million.\n\nLater in 1994, Katzenberg co-founded\nDreamWorks SKG with Steven Spielberg and David\nGeffen, with Katzenberg taking primary responsibility for\nanimation operations. He was also credited as executive\nproducer on the DreamWorks animated films The Prince\nof Egypt (1998), The Road to El Dorado and Joseph:\nKing of Dreams (both in 2000) and Shrek in 2001.\n\nAfter DreamWorks Animation suffered a\n$125 million loss on the traditionally-animated Sinbad:\nLegend of the Seven Seas, the studio switched to all\ncomputer-generated animation. Since then, DreamWorks’\nanimated films have been consistently successful.\n\nIn 2004, DreamWorks Animation (DWA)\nwas spun off from DreamWorks as a separate\ncompany headed by Katzenberg in an IPO and has\nrecorded mostly profitable quarters since then.\n\nThe live-action DreamWorks movie studio was\nsold to Viacom in December 2006. In 2008, the live-\naction DreamWorks studio again became an independent\nproduction company, releasing its films through Disney.\n\nIn 2006, Katzenberg made an appearance on the\nfifth season of The Apprentice. He awarded the task winners\n\nJEFFREY KATZENBERG\n\nan opportunity to be character voices in Over the Hedge.\n\nKatzenberg has been an industry leader in promoting\ndigital 3D production of film, calling it “the greatest advance\nin the film industry since the arrival of color in the 1930s.”\nWhen Katzenberg appeared on The Colbert Report on April\n20, 2010, he confirmed that from now on “every single\nmovie” that DreamWorks Animation produced would be\nin 3D and gave Stephen Colbert a pair of new 3D glasses.\n\nKatzenberg married Marilyn Siegel, a kindergarten\nteacher, in 1975, and they have two children.\n\nTogether, Marilyn and Jeffrey have been highly\nactive in charitable causes. They donated the multi-\nmillion-dollar Katzenberg Center to Boston University’s\nCollege of General Studies, citing that the school gave\ntheir two children the “love of education.” They also\ndonated the Marilyn and Jeffrey Katzenberg Center for\nAnimation at the University of Southern California.\n\nIn addition to serving as Chairman of the Board\nfor the Motion Picture and Television Fund Foundation,\nKatzenberg sits on the boards or serves as a trustee of AIDS\nProject Los Angeles, American Museum of the Moving Image,\nCalifornia Institute of the Arts, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center,\nGeffen Playhouse, Michael J. Fox Foundation for Parkinson’s\nResearch, University of Southern California School of\nCinematic Arts and The Simon Wiesenthal Center. Together\nwith DreamWorks Animation, Katzenberg founded the\nDreamWorks Animation Academy of Inner-City Arts in 2008.\n\nKatzenberg has an estimated worth of $800\nmillion according to Forbes. Katzenberg is reported to\nhave donated over $3.5 million in political contributions\nsince 1979: 33% ($1.171+ million) to Democrats, 66%\n\n($2.33+ million) to special interest groups without party\naffiliations, and less than 1% ($7,000) to Republicans.\n\nHe was awarded an honorary doctorate from\nRingling College of Art and Design on May 2, 2008.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_017547\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

And with McCain’s more aggressive\nplan aligned on the same premise of\nmodernizing and improving the readiness\nof the US military, Trump will likely have the\nbacking of this influential member of the\nRepublican congressional leadership.\n\nToday's Economic Backdrop—\n\nSimilar to the 1960s\n\nThe economic and financial implications of\na large, multiyear defense-spending plan\nmust be weighed against the economic\nenvironment at the time of implementation.\nAnd from a historical context, today’s\nconditions have more similarities to the\neconomic setting of the mid- 1960s than\nduring the defense buildups of the early\n1980s or early 2000s, which were either\nin recession or the very early stages of\nrecovery.\n\nIn contrast, the US economy in the mid-\n1960s was already in its fifth year of\nexpansion, the jobless rate of 4.5% was\nrelatively low and inflation was tame\n(roughly 1.5%). Nonetheless, the extra\ndefense spending boosted domestic\ndemand growth and added significant\npressure to labor costs, materials and\nsupplies, and product prices. So much so\nthat the acceleration in consumer price\ninflation (from 1% in 1961 to near 6% in\n19°70) from the start to the end of that\nbusiness cycle was one of the largest of\nany economic growth cycle during the\npostwar period.\n\nToday’s economic backdrop looks similar in\nmany ways. The economy has been in\nrecovery for seven years, the jobless rate is\nin the mid-4% range and inflation is stable\n(at around 2%). While many domestic and\nglobal factors are different now, we would\nstill expect a large multiyear defense-\n\nspending program to add to growth and\nput upward pressure on labor costs and\ninflation in the coming years. Keep in mind\nthat we’re coming off the weakest five-year\ndefense spending trend in the past 50\nyears, so Trump’s defense spending need\nnot match any of the prior three to have a\nmajor impact.\n\nStay tuned for the unveiling of Trump’s\nbudget and pay close attention to the\ndefense spending request. A large\nmulti-year program would definitely lift\ninflationary pressures. While we wouldn't\nexpect an acceleration like that in the\n1960s, a sustained rise of 100 to 200\nbasis points in general inflation would still\nseem reasonable—and far above what the\nFederal Reserve and financial markets are\ncurrently expecting. =\n\nThe information contained herein reflects the views of AllianceBernstein L-P. or its affiliates and sources it believes are reliable as of the date of this publication.\nAllianceBernstein LP. makes no representations or warranties concerning the accuracy of any data.

Beliefs, ideologies, norms, laws, and customs, by\nregulating the behavior of the humans who share them, can shape a society and power the\ncourse of historical events as surely as the phenomena of physics affect the structure and\nevolution of the solar system. To say that ideas—and not just weather, resources,\ngeography, or weaponry—can shape history is not woolly mysticism. It is a statement of\nthe causal powers of information instantiated in human brains and exchanged in networks\nof communication and feedback. Deterministic theories of history, whether they identify\nthe causal engine as technological, climatological, or geographic, are belied by the causal\npower of ideas. The effects of these ideas can include unpredictable lurches and\noscillations that arise from positive feedback or from miscalibrated negative feedback.\n\nAn analysis of society in terms of its propagation of ideas also gave Wiener a\nguideline for social criticism. A healthy society—one that gives its members the means\nto pursue life in defiance of entropy—allows information sensed and contributed by its\nmembers to feed back and affect how the society is governed. A dysfunctional society\ninvokes dogma and authority to impose control from the top down. Wiener thus\ndescribed himself as “a participant in a liberal outlook,” and devoted most of the moral\nand rhetorical energy in the book (both the 1950 and 1954 editions) to denouncing\ncommunism, fascism, McCarthyism, militarism, and authoritarian religion (particularly\nCatholicism and Islam) and to warning that political and scientific institutions were\nbecoming too hierarchical and insular.\n\nWiener’s book is also, here and there, an early exemplar of an increasingly\npopular genre, tech prophecy. Prophecy not in the sense of mere prognostications but in\nthe Old Testament sense of dark warnings of catastrophic payback for the decadence of\none’s contemporaries. Wiener warned against the accelerating nuclear arms race, against\ntechnological change that was imposed without regard to human welfare (“[W]e must\nknow as scientists what man’s nature is and what his built-in purposes are”), and against\nwhat today is called the value-alignment problem: that “the machine like the djinnee,\nwhich can learn and can make decisions on the basis of its learning, will in no way be\nobliged to make such decisions as we should have made, or will be acceptable to us.” In\nthe darker, 1950 edition, he warned of a “threatening new Fascism dependent on the\nmachine a gouverner.”\n\nWiener’s tech prophecy harks back to the Romantic movement’s rebellion against\nthe “dark Satanic mills” of the Industrial Revolution, and perhaps even earlier, to the\narchetypes of Prometheus, Pandora, and Faust. And today it has gone into high gear.\nJeremiahs, many of them (like Wiener) from the worlds of science and technology, have\nsounded alarms about nanotechnology, genetic engineering, Big Data, and particularly\nartificial intelligence. Several contributors to this volume characterize Wiener’s book as\na prescient example of tech prophecy and amplify his dire worries.\n\nYet the two moral themes of The Human Use of Human Beings—the liberal\ndefense of an open society and the dystopian dread of runaway technology—are in\ntension. A society with channels of feedback that maximize human flourishing will have\nmechanisms in place, and can adapt them to changing circumstances, in a way that can\ndomesticate technology to human purposes. There’s nothing idealistic or mystical about\nthis; as Wiener emphasized, ideas, norms, and institutions are themselves a form of\ntechnology, consisting of patterns of information distributed across brains.

Optimizing good information to push down the negative: using new content (blog, \nwebsites, press releases, public network profiles, google images, etc) and search engine \noptimization. Changing the Wikipedia profile. Notes Wikipedia below. \n2. Eliminating the bad information using prevalence and proprietary algorithms; redirecting \nthe way in which Google sequences your information (reassociating it with the positive \ncontent). This is called off-page optimization. \n3. Eliminating personal information (social sec, tel #'s, dob, addresses etc) from all public \nand private directories. \nCOMMENTS:  \nStep 2 is critical otherwise one is just bailing water from an ongoing flood of negative press. By \nrealigning the algorithms (i.e. reinforcing positive associations with your name and weakening the \nnegative associations), one almost permanently seals up the water hole or at least closes it \nsignificantly. This allows for Step 1 to be a onetime project (which will take 2 to 4 months approx.), \nwith just tweaking here and there down the road with updated content. \nBEST PEOPLE TO USE:  \nYou need people who eat, drink and sleep algorithms and search engine optimization. I've \nresearched several companies and the most skilled, discrete, award winning and comprehensive is \na company called, www.reputation.com based in Silicon Valley. See their attached docs for review. \nBelow are bulleted key points on them: \nLookup Page just creates web pages and will not solve your problem. \nI would serve as a liaison between you and Reputation. I would monitor their progress and provide \nthem with all positive content that they need. They would make sure that the content has maximum \nalgorithmic potential. You could keep your positive content simple (using you Edge.org summary \nwhich is good), or expand your content with updates on current science work and scientists. The \nbenefit of the former, is that it keeps you more anonymous. The benefit of the latter is that is \nalgorithmically associates you to a larger pool of known scientists, further pushing up positive \ncontent. My advice would be to combine the two: a simple repetitive bio summary of you but with a \nlarger list of scientists added on. But I would ask the Reputation team about this: saying that the \nmain goal is to enhance anonymity and algorithmic associations at the same time. \nWHY REPUTATION ftr  no particular order)  \n• Represents numerous fortune 500 companies \n• clients in more than 100 countries \n• based in Silicon Valley \n• Featured on CNN, WSJ, Forbes, NY Times etc \n• Undisputed world leader in online reputation management \n• Prevalence and proprietary algorithms to drive positive search results to the top. \n• Intimate knowledge of search engine optimization. \n• 200+ employees \n• Patented Internet technology \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 025233 \n• Partnered with: American Medical Assoc. Am Bar Assoc, Aol, etc \n• $67 million in venture capital to date. \n• CEO is Michael Fertik \nCEO and Founder \nMichael Fertik founded Reputation.com in 2006 \nwith the belief that people have the right to control \nand protect their online reputation and privacy. In \naddition to his work with Reputation.com, Michael \nholds a position on the advisory board of The Internet \nKeepsafe Coalition (iKeepSafe), a nonprofit that \nworks to protect the health and safety of youth online. \nMichael is regarded as one of the earliest pioneers of \nonline reputation management and a leading expert \non issues of online privacy. He co-authored the book \nWild West 2.0 and lectures internationally, appearing \nbefore professional and academic audiences. Michael \nalso advises school administrators and parent groups. \nPrior to founding Reputation.com, Michael clerked for \nChief Judge Danny J. Boggs of the Sixth Circuit Court \nof Appeals of the United States. He is a graduate of \nHarvard College and Harvard Law School, speaks \nseveral languages, and enjoys sailing, reading, and \nrunning. \nTIME FRAME & FEES \nTheir \"Picasso\" Tech services described in step 2, will take approx. 3 months to eliminate bad press from the \n1st and 2'd page. The whole process will take about a year to be solidified. Fees will be approx. $10k -$15k \nper month but depends on each case and costs can be kept down by providing content and selecting only \ntruly necessary services. \nWIKIPEDIA \nThis is a tough nut to crack. And I need to do more research on this. Wiki comes up first on the \nGoogle list due to its powerful domain and contains totally lopsided and damning content on you. \nBut we'll crack it. On the surface, Wiki is controlled by a morass of copyediting geeks who have \nnothing better to do than to discuss reference tags etc. It is also 'the people's' encyclopedia, \ndictated by the tyranny of the majority—so no objectivity at all. \nCurrent Strategy— 1.

While I am running the risk that you will report my \ncomments, if you do, either out of context, or incompletely, I am responding with an effort to be complete. It is \nhard to know how to respond to a list of false and/or distorted allegations, along with misleading statements on \nyour part. I treat people I interact with with respect, and I work hard to support and mentor students, colleagues, \nand members of the general public. I do not sexually harass people. If the purpose of your reporting is to \nsomehow argue that Universities and other institutions are lax in dealing with well known individuals like \nmyself, then in fact the situation is quite the opposite. My high public profile opens me up to more scrutiny at \nthese institutions, not less, and it also opens me up to a host of outside complaints and allegations that other \nfaculty do not receive, each of which the University has to respond to. The fact that I have remained a professor \nin all Universities with which I have been associated, in good standing, and also an officer or an invited speaker \nat organizations like CFI, which have strict harassment policies, is a confirmation of the fact that they trust my \nbehavior. I was asked to be an honorary director of CFI, and invited to their last 3 meetings to speak, \nspecifically because, as they have written me after the fact, the attendees universally appreciated my talks, my \ncourtesy, and graciousness in spending time with the attendees. If the purpose of your report is to impugn my \nintegrity or suggest I have a history of harassment, that too is false. As noted in one of your 'miscellaneous \nfacts', as a scientist I try and remain skeptical, and rely on empirical evidence, rather than allegations and \ninnuendo. I also try and judge the facts in context. The fact that Universities and other organizations employ \nme or have me on their boards, or invite me to meetings is because they value my contributions and my actions. \nThe items you list are false or distorted. Item 1 refers to a consensual encounter in my hotel room in 2006 where \nwe mutually decided, in a polite discussion in fact, that taking it any further would not be appropriate, and there \nwere respectful and platonic encounters afterwards. There is nothing to comment on in item 3, which involves \nan anonymous 3rd party claim because I know nothing about it, there are no details provided, and it clearly was \nnot taken seriously enough to result in any university action. Item 4 is confusing. Are you saying that because I \ndecided I didn't want to go out to a bar with a group of attendees that I was harassing them? The second part \ndid not happen. Re incident 5: The 'female companion' in this case is my wife, who can attest to the fact that \nthe claim is false, which is what I wrote at the time in response to the blog in question, causing it to be taken \ndown. \nIt is worth responding to Item 2 and 6 in more detail, \nRe item 2: the student in question was interested in science communication, and on dozens of occasions came \nto me or wrote to me with questions. When she asked about advice for after graduation I DID tell her she was \ndifferent than the other students in her year. The rest of them were interested in going on to graduate school, \nbut she was interested in science communication so I told her that she might want to take a different path. Since \nshe was the only woman in her year, as I recall, I did ask her on one of these occasions if that made it difficult \nfor her in any way. I asked, because as a faculty member I was interested in knowing what we could do, if \nnecessary to encourage more women to go into physics, and also because as someone she had asked for career \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 031246 \nadvice from I wanted to know if that made a difference to her. Re asking her for dinner.. I have gone back over \nemails from that period. I have numerous requests from her asking me to go for coffee to talk, which I usually \nhad to turn down because I was busy, and on several occasions sh specifically asked me to have coffee with her \noff campus to talk, and I politely declined. I did let her accompany me off campus one time to watch me do a \nBBC interview because she specifically requested it. I did and do have coffee and meals with students on \ncampus, and I see nothing wrong with this. I try to treat even students as respected colleagues if possible. I was \nshocked when I later learned of the complaint she was apparently asked to lodge to the University, not least \nbecause there was no inappropriate interaction and also because, well after the dates you listed on which she \nwas apparently offended, she continued to email me with joking questions or comments. Also, at a later AAAS \nconference, again in 2008, for which she had asked, and for which I had written her a letter of recommendation \nto attend, my wife and I gave her a lift in our taxi well out out of our way in order to drop her off at her hotel, \nand I note in an email response to her email about the conference, agin in 2008, I expressed that I would pass \nher regards along to my wife and vice versa. When the University later informed me of the complaint I was \nshocked and concerned. When I spoke to the human resources person, including relating my concerns and \nproviding the emails in question, I was told that no formal complaint of sexual harassment was deemed at that \ntime to be called for, and that the young woman in question had agreed to that. By that time I learned of the \ncomplaint I had already announced my intentions to leave Case to accept an offer at ASU—a very difficult \ndecision for me because of my long-standing attachment to the University, and the excellent relations I had with \nmy colleagues there, both among the faculty and among the administration. Because I was already in Arizona \nat the time I was asked not to have any further interaction with the student I agreed to that request, both to \nrespect her sensitivities and also because it was basically moot because I was not on campus. I was also told \nthat because it was being handled informally, that (a) it should remain confidential, which I, at least abided by, \nand (b) if no further complaints were lodged in that case, that the University would remove the complaint from \nmy record after 5 years, which makes me surprised that someone violated that written agreement with you. \nRe item 6: You report on ASU's response to item #6 , without including the fact that the University specifically \nstated there were never any allegations of sexual misconduct or harassment by me at the University, and \nmorever the outside complaints were in fact related specifically to your item #6. Further you neglect to \nmention that this complaint was by an anonymous third party, not the individual who was allegedly harassed, \nwho never lodged a complain, and that no specific evidence was provided of the alleged transgression. I was \nsurprised and dismayed that both ASU and ANU launched investigations on the basis of this but was told by \nboth Universities that because of my high profile even such unsubstantiated third party complaints at private \nevents unrelated to the University would be investigated. The complaint was investigated throughly by both \nASU and ANU and both came to the conclusion that it was not credible and no university policies had been \nviolated.. In addition ANU's investigation, which took a full month found significant inconsistencies in the \nallegation, suggesting distortion and fabrication, I will quote from the ANU report. The initial complaint, which \nin fact resulted in a temporary suspension of my position at ANU, until it was dismissed, outlined the claim you \nmade in the words you quoted in your note to me, but it also stated \n\"It is the University's understanding that a complaint was lodged directly to the conference organisers at the \ntime of the incident.\" \nAfter the month-long investigation, during which I was told I was not to interact with anyone on campus (again \nmoot because I was a hemisphere removed) the final report absolved me of any wrongdoing, and indicated \ninformation inconsistent with the original claim and apparent later claims as follows in the report, from which I \nquote: \n\"The allegations were made by an observer to the incident. \n- The complaint did not identify, nor disclose the identity of the conference attendee who was allegedly touched \nin \nan unwelcome manner. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 031247 \n- The conference attendee who took the `selfie' photo did not lodge a formal complaint to the conference \norganisers \nat the time of the incident (November 2016). \n- The conference attendee who witnessed the incident, did not lodge a formal complaint to the conference \norganisers \nat the time of the incident (November 2016). \nThe photo submitted as part of the complaint does not provide evidence of any physical contact. \n- The complainant alleged that a photo exists, showing your hand on the breast of the conference attendee who \ntook \nthe `selfie' photo. This photo was not made available to the Australian National University, although it was \nrequested \nin the course of the investigation.\" \n(And for the record I often put my hand up in front of a camera if there is a flash, as I specifically request selfies \nnot to include flashes, so that I don't end up with a series bright spots in front of my eyes for the next half hour) \nWhat makes this particular type of allegation so repugnant is that I get asked for literally thousands of selfies, \nand when people come up to me they are vulnerable, often shaking, and sometimes overly aggressive. I am \nparticularly proud of the way I attempt to make all people feel at ease, and respected, rather than humiliated. \nThus, this false claim strikes at the heart of what I am about, which is to acknowledge fans in a way that makes \nthem feel appreciated. As I understand you had a reporter watching me sign books and take selfies at the CFI \nconference in Las Vegas this year, that behavior is what they will have witnessed. Moreover, I am proud of the \ninteractions I have had at both Case and ASU, with students, colleagues and staff of all genders and \nethnicities.

As we've already discussed by email, I'd very much like to interview you about these allegations in \ndetail. \nIn particular, you stated in an email sent on Nov 13 that two universities had investigated an incident (# 6 \nbelow). You claimed that \"both Universities independently concluded that the report was unsubstantiated and \nfabricated with malicious intent.\" We are not aware that either university concluded fabrication or malicious \nintent, so if you have evidence to support this assertion, we would like to see and discuss it. \nThe story concerns your actions towards students while a professor of physics at Case Western Reserve \nUniversity, as well as your conduct in non-academic settings as a prominent figure in the skeptics movement. I \nam reporting this story along with two of my colleagues on the science desk, Azeen Ghorayshi and Virginia \nHughes. \nOur story is about several allegations of sexual misconduct dating from 2006 to 2016 (see full details below). \nOur reporting also goes into how the various institutions you have been affiliated with — Case Western, \nArizona State University, the Australian National University, the New College of the Humanities, and the Center \nfor Inquiry, for which you serve as an honorary member of the board of directors — have handled complaints \nand concerns about your behavior during this time. \nOur story is corroborated by emails, university documents, official complaints, testimony from victims and \neyewitnesses, and interviews with more than two dozen of your current and former academic colleagues, \nstudents, and peers in the skeptics movement. \nI wanted to offer you the opportunity to comment and/or respond to the main facts we plan to publish. If you \nwish to comment on any of the below findings, we need to hear from you as soon as possible. We are \nplanning on publishing our story Tuesday morning, Eastern US Time. \nBased on our reporting, this is what we plan to publish: \nIncident 1: \n• In November of 2006, at an event launching the new Center for Inquiry in Washington D.C., you met a \nvolunteer for CFI D.C. \n• At the event, you asked for her business card. Later, you followed her as she was leaving and asked \nher if she was \"of age.\" \n• Later, you emailed her to invite her to dinner. \n• You planned to dine with her in the restaurant at the Washington D.C. hotel where you were staying. \n• You told her to come up to your room first because you needed to finish some work. \n• In your hotel room, you seemed in no rush to leave. You ordered a cheese plate, and later champagne, \ndespite her suggestion that you go down to dinner. \n• You then made a comment about her eye makeup, getting very close to her face. \n• You then lifted her by her arms, and pushed her onto the bed beneath you, forcibly kissing her and \ntrying to pull down the crotch of her tights. \n• She struggled to push you off her. \n• You said, \"When I was in college I could never get a girl that looked like you.\" \n• When you pulled out a condom, she got out from under you. She said \"I have to go,\" and rushed out of \nthe room. \nIncident 2: \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 031251 \n• In an incident that occurred in fall of 2007 while you were a physics professor at Case Western Reserve \nUniversity, a student tried to talk to you about her plans after graduation. You mentioned to her how tough it \nmust be to have all the other physics majors asking her out on dates. \n• In a second incident in December of 2007, while you were still at Case Western, the same student \nvisited your office to interview you for a student science journal. You closed the door behind her, and ignored \nthe questions she had prepared. Then you made a casual comment about taking her out for dinner. \n• Later, in a regular column for the school paper, she described her experiences with you, without \nmentioning you by name. \"There was even one particular creep of a professor who once told me he thought \ndifferently of me compared to other students and asked me to dinner: a situation so disturbing that it left me \nupset for weeks afterward,\" she wrote. \n• She was then approached by a dean at the university, who suspected that she was referring to you, \nbased on a previously reported incident with another student. He encouraged her to make a complaint, and \nshe did. \n• University investigators interviewed both you and the student. \n• On September 4, 2008, Susan Nickel-Schindewolf, the university's associate vice president for student \naffairs, wrote to the student, telling her that the investigation was complete. She wrote that you had been told: \n\"This type of behavior could constitute sexual harassment in violation of the university's sexual harassment \npolicy. \n• The letter also stated that you were prohibited from making contact with the student as long as she \nremained at Case. \n• The letter also stated that you are required to get approval from the dean or the chair of the physics \ndepartment before setting foot on the campus again. \n• The letter also stated, \"Dr. Krauss expressed regret about having a negative impact on you, and also \nhis willingness to use this complaint as an opportunity to reflect and improve on his future interactions with \nstudents.\" \n• By then, you had already left Case, taking up your current position at Arizona State University the \nmonth before. \n• \"The opportunities being offered at ASU are simply too great to turn down at this stage in my career,\" \nyou told Case colleagues, in an email announcing your departure on April 16, 2008. \nIncident 3: \n• A former Case Western physics department administrator confirmed that she had reported a previous \nincident involving a student who had confided in her about your inappropriate behavior towards her. \nIncident 4: \n• You met a student from another university, an atheist activist, in March 2008 at the American Atheists \nConvention in Minneapolis. She wanted to expand the atheist group she ran at the midwestern university she \nwas attending, and hoped to convince you to come and speak. You initially seemed enthusiastic. \n• During the convention, attendees including you and Richard Dawkins went for dinner with the student \nand volunteers for Dawkins' foundation. \n• Afterwards, the student invited you to join the volunteers for a drink. \n• You asked her to come get you in your hotel room. She was wary of your intentions, and so brought a \nmale friend with her. Opening the door to find them both there, you informed her you had decided not to go. \n• You met this student again at the American Atheists Convention in Des Moines, Iowa, in April 2011. \n• \ntable. \nYou pulled over a chair for her in the bar, and then started running your hand up her leg under the \n• She tried to shift her body away from you, and you persisted in putting your hand on her leg. She \ncrossed her legs, and you kept trying. Then she turned her entire body away. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 031252 \nIncident 5: \n• This incident allegedly occurred on in May 2011 on a CFI cruise. We understand that CFI staff were \ninformed that you had propositioned a female cruise-goer, who rejected an invitation to join you and your \nfemale companion for sex in your cabin. \n• At least two CFI staffers were sufficiently concerned about reports of your behavior that they urged \nCFI's president not to invite you on a 2014 cruise of the Galapagos Islands. You were invited on that cruise, \nhowever. \nIncident 6: \n• During a visit to Melbourne, Australia, in November 2016, you were accused of sexual misconduct once \nagain. \n• The incident happened at a dinner held at the Melbourne Zoo as part of the Australian Skeptics  \nNational Convention, where you were a featured speaker. \n• With conference delegates chatting over drinks, a woman asked you for a celebrity selfie. \n• As the woman held out her phone to take the picture, you reached over her shoulder and grabbed her \nright breast. \n• She immediately reacted, bodychecking you and spinning around. \"Don't do that,\" she said. \n• BuzzFeed News has seen the complaint made by another woman to ASU, ANU, and the New College \nof the Humanities in London, including the selfie, her face obscured to conceal her identity. It shows your hand \nin motion as a blur in front of her shoulder, apparently moving toward her chest. Two other eyewitnesses have \nconfirmed the complainant's account of what happened. \n• In April 2017, the complainant described the incident on her blog. After hearing more about your \nreputation for inappropriate behavior from blog readers, she decided to file a complaint about the Nov. 2016 \nincident. \n• On July 16, she filed formal complaints with Arizona State University, and with the Australian National \nUniversity in Canberra and the New College of the Humanities in London, where you have visiting \nappointments. \n• Both Arizona State and the Australian National University told her they would look into the matter. But \nneither university found against you. \n• \"Based on the material available to the University, we do not have sufficient evidence to substantiate \nthe allegations,\" Kiaran Kirk, dean of the College of Science at the Australian National University, wrote to her. \n• Erin Ellison, who heads Arizona State's Office of Equity & Inclusion, wrote to her explaining that an \ninquiry \"did not find a violation of university policy.\" \n• In October, Arizona State denied a request from BuzzFeed News for documents relating to complaints \nof sexual harassment against you. However, Cynthia Jewett, the university's senior associate general counsel, \nnoted that two individuals, neither affiliated with the university, had complained about you. \"The University did \nnot find either communication to state a credible allegation,\" Jewett wrote. \nMiscellaneous facts: \n• In 2008, you founded the Origins Project at Arizona State University in Tempe, a multidisciplinary effort \nto understand the origins of the universe, life, and social systems. You have led that effort ever since. \n• Thanks to best-selling books like The Physics of Star Trek and A Universe From Nothing, frequent \nessays in publications including the New Yorker and the New York Times, and the documentary you made with \nbiologist Richard Dawkins, called The Unbelievers, you are celebrated as one of America's leading public \nintellectuals. \n• You served on the science policy committee for Barack Obama's 2008 presidential campaign and are a \nvocal critic of President Donald Trump. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 031253 \n• You also make regular public appearances across the world, often at gatherings of skeptics and \natheists. \n• At CSICon in Las Vegas in October, a few dozen fans paid $500 per head to attend a VIP luncheon \nwith you and Dawkins. \n• Many more lined up to get you to sign their copy of your latest book, The Greatest Story Ever Told — \nSo Far. \n• Online, people can buy T-shirts emblazoned \"Lawrence Krauss for President.\" \n• In talks and interviews, you have argued that our universe arose without divine intervention, that \nreligion drives xenophobia, and that our brains are hardwired to believe. \n• You have stated that science provides answers to many of life's biggest questions, and can even fix \ngreat societal injustices. \n• Earlier this year, at a Q&A event to promote your new book, the conversation came around to the \ndearth of women and minorities in science. \"Science itself overcomes misogyny and prejudice and bias,\" you \nsaid. \"It's built in: Questioning yourself, always questioning results, questioning others, relying on empirical \nevidence.\" \n• You have clashed with some skeptics over your defense of Jeffrey Epstein, a billionaire financier who in \n2008 was convicted for soliciting prostitution from underage girls, and spent 13 months in a Florida jail. \n• Through his private foundation, Epstein has funded the work of several prominent scientists. He has \nprovided funding for your Origins Project, supporting lectureship and scholarship programs, most recently \npledging $100,000 in 2014. \n• In April 2011, you told the Daily Beast: \"As a scientist I always judge things on empirical evidence and \nhe always has women ages 19 to 23 around him, but I've never seen anything else, so as a scientist, my \npresumption is that whatever the problems were I would believe him over other people.\" \n• In a blog comment about the Epstein controversy, you wrote: \"I remain skeptical, and I support a man \nwhose character I believe I know.. .If you want to condemn me for that, so be it.\" \n• You were made an honorary member of CFI's board of directors in December 2011. \n• A blog post published in August 2013 described incidents #1 and #4, naming you. Another post, \npublished at around the same time, described incident #5. \n• The first post was edited to remove your name after you had commented that the allegations of assault \nwere \"potentially illegal.\" The second post was quickly taken down. \nAgain, if you wish to comment on or clarify any of these points, please get in touch with us as soon as possible. \nIf I do not respond immediately it is because I am on another call, so please leave the best phone number to \nreach you. \nThanks, \n11111 \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 031254 \n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

But with the convergence of\ncommunication and computation with fabrication, these investigations are now becoming\naccessible experimentally. Making an assembler that can assemble itself from the parts\nthat it’s assembling is a focus of my lab, along with collaborations to develop synthetic\ncells.\n\nThe prospect of physically self-reproducing automata is potentially much scarier\nthan fears of out-of-control AI, because it moves the intelligence out here to where we\nlive. It could be a roadmap leading to Terminator’s Skynet robotic overlords. But it’s\nalso a more hopeful prospect, because an ability to program atoms as well as bits enables\ndesigns to be shared globally while locally producing things like energy, food, and\nshelter—all of these are emerging as exciting early applications of digital fabrication.\nWiener worried about the future of work, but he didn’t question implicit assumptions\nabout the nature of work which are challenged when consumption can be replaced by\ncreation.\n\nHistory suggests that neither utopian nor dystopian scenarios prevail; we\ngenerally end up muddling along somewhere in between. But history also suggests that\nwe don’t have to wait on history. Gordon Moore in 1965 was able to use five years of the\ndoubling of the specifications of integrated circuits to project what turned out to be fifty\nyears of exponential improvements in digital technologies. We’ve spent many of those\nyears responding to, rather than anticipating, its implications. We have more data\navailable now than Gordon Moore did to project fifty years of doubling the performance\nof digital fabrication. With the benefit of hindsight, it should be possible to avoid the\nexcesses of digital computing and communications this time around, and, from the outset,\naddress issues like access and literacy.\n\nIf the maker movement is the harbinger of a third digital revolution, the success of\nAI in meeting many of its own early goals can be seen as the crowning achievement of\nthe first two digital revolutions. Although machine making and machine thinking might\nappear to be unrelated trends, they lie in each other’s futures. The same scaling trends\nthat have made AI possible suggest that the current mania is a phase that will pass, to be\nfollowed by something even more significant: the merging of artificial and natural\nintelligence.\n\nIt was an advance for atoms to form molecules, molecules to form organelles,\norganelles to form cells, cells to form organs, organs to form organisms, organisms to\nform families, families to form societies, and societies to form civilizations.

Consistent with intuition, since every transition is\npossible, the topological entropy of M; as indicated in its M;; is maximal (= 1).\nAnother expression equal to the sum of the trace (the sum of the upper left to lower\nright diagonal) in a square matrix, is its leading eigenva/ue, most often symbolized\nwith a lambda, 41.

More compactly, the non-uniform probabilistic, metric entropy,\ndiffering from the maximal topological entropy indicates that the system is in a\ndynamical state of in-between entropy, written as H7 - Hy + 0.\n\nIn the computation of the metric entropy, Hy, the M; is transformed into a\ntransition probability matrix, M;p, called a Markov matrix named for one of the two\ngreat Russian mathematicians, both students of Pafnuti Lvovich Chebyshev, the\n\nMarkov brothers.

Larry was his main pilot, he had shiny grey hair\nand long lanky legs, but a very sincere smile that instantly made you feel\nat ease. He greeted us at the staircase that led into the main cabin. It was\nas lavish as [| imagined it would be. The seats were enveloped in the finest\nbeige leather with polished wood grain finishes and there was a kitchen in\nthe back with an adjoining toilet. Jeffrey saw the amazement in my eyes\nand to make it more thrilling he brought me up to the cockpit and let me\nwatch with a bird’s eye view of the take off. I was on a natural high when\nI came back to the cabin and was instantly brought back down when\nJeffrey rested his bare feet on top of the reclined seat and instructed me to\nget to work and start massaging him. My future was in his hands now, so\nwhen he wanted something, | wouldn’t hesitate in giving it to him.\n\nChapter 6\n\nUpon our arrival at New Jersey’s Private Airstrip, the driver Jo-Jo met\nus. His name was most likely shortened for something of his oriental\ndecent. Jeffrey liked to shorten the names of his multi-cultural staff into\nAmerican names. Even Juan and Maria were known as John and Mary.\nWe arrived in the Upper East Side of Manhattan. His principal place of\nresidence was the largest home in Manhattan, eight stories of opulence. It\nused to be a Private School for boy’s many years ago, until Les Wexner,\nJeffrey’s best friend and mentor bought it for him as a mysterious gift.\n\nThere were two large Chinese gargoyles outside the entrance, and\nbeside the heavy looking wooden doors there was an intercom with a\ncamera overlooking us. 1 walked up the concrete steps into a realm of\nwealth, glamour and most of all influence. My eye’s glistened at the\nsplendor of his palace. Caramel colored marble tiles spread through the\nfirst floor, where his gourmet kitchen and dining hall were also located.\nThen I came to this sweeping staircase that curved into the next level\nwhere Jeffrey and I went into his office, even though it looked more like\na museum exhibit. Ancient draperies that told lascivious stories of their\nown covered parts of the elevated walls, and the remaining wall spaces\nwere taken up by rows on top of rows of books. He loved to read, as he\n\n35\n\noften found it hard to sleep and was comforted in the early morning hours\nwith his literature, or sometimes in other ways I would come to find out.\nThere was a mantle piece and a sofa with two armchairs next to the grand\npiano that flaunted more of Jeffrey’s beautiful conquests, young women\nposing in salacious pictures, suggesting I could be easily replaced next to\none of those girls if] failed in keeping him satisfied. There were also\nsome pictures with recognizable political and royal figures either shaking\nJeffrey’s hand, or with an arm around each other, even one with Jeffrey\nand the Dali Lama, although his church was the bank. He liked to use his\npower, wealth, and money to manipulate everyone in his life.\n\nHe made a phone call that sounded business like and I didn’t mind, I\nwas quite enjoying taking in all of the beauty around me, I was blinded\nby all of it. I was still waiting for him when, Ghislane came in. She asked\nme what I thought so far of my trip to N.Y.C, | knew she was talking\nabout the house, she loved to gloat, even though none of it actually\nbelonged to her, she wanted everyone to believe that it did. I\ncomplimented her on the mid-evil looking tapestries and a few other\nadornments, when she cut me off mid-sentence to compliment it herself,\ntelling me the history about one of the 17\" century tapestry’s which to an\nunsophisticated eye, looked to me like a rug on the wall.\n\nJeffrey hung the phone up and walked over to the sofa where we were\nsitting next to the mantle piece and took a seat on one of the armchairs.\nHe didn’t seem worried from the phone call but his mind was definitely\nsomewhere else from the hard look on his face. We all spoke for a few\nmoments more about the splendid décor before Jeffrey had enough small\ntalk and needed some of his own relaxation time. He told Ghislane he\nwas going to show me to the massage room and he’d be back in a couple\nhours. She agreed he looked like he could use some time to unwind and\nwith that wry grin of hers, she gave me a look that told me precisely how\nhe was expecting to be relaxed.\n\nWe left his office all together, Ghislane going downstairs, and Jeffrey\nshowing me to the lifts. The lift looked like it’s original that came with\nthe school. It was made out of brass antique with archaic cuts throughout\nthe arches at the top. It wasn’t the only lift in the house, but certainly the\nmost beautiful. We walked down a long hall carpeted in a royal red and\ngolden trim, passing by a bronze pagan statue of the horny little goat God\n“Pan’. How adequate, I thought, fit Jeffrey to a tee.

Though both of the Israelis were friends of Yossi Beilin, a protégé of\nPeres and our deputy foreign minister, even Peres didn’t know about the\nmeeting until Yossi told him the following day. Rabin knew an hour later. I first\nlearned of it from Uni Saguy, after Unit 8200 intercepted Arabic-language\ntraffic concerning a briefing the Norwegians had given their Arab contacts. At\nfirst, even Peres was skeptical that the paper agreed at the “seminar” — calling\nfor international aid to the West Bank and Gaza on the scale of the Marshall\nPlan, and an initial Israeli withdrawal limited to Gaza — would lead to serious\nnegotiations. But Rabin authorized follow-up sessions in mid-February, late\nMarch and again in April. Our intelligence teams continued to provide detail,\nand occasional color. Uri Saguy and I even began to use the Arabic shorthand,\nfrom the intelligence reports, for the two Israeli academics. The burly, bearded\nYair Hirschfeld was “the bear”. The slighter Ron Pundak was “the mouse”. Yet\nthe main political impetus in driving the process forward came from two men\nwho were not there: on our side, Yossi Beilin, and for the Palestinians, Arafat’s\ntrusted diplomatic adviser, and eventual successor, Mahmoud Abbas, or Abu\nMazen.\n\nSince Rabin knew I was following the ostensibly secret talks, we discussed\nthem often. For quite a while, he remained dismissive. He believed the chances\nof a breakthrough were remote. He was also suspicious of the involvement of\nPeres and Beilin, whom he called “Shimon’s poodle’. And he deeply distrusted\nArafat. The PLO had been founded with the aim of “liberating” every inch of\nPalestine. The fact that Arafat had agreed to the Bush Administration’s demand\nto accept the principle of land-for-peace struck Rabin as mere sleight-of-hand.\n\nBy the third Oslo meeting, it was clear that the Palestinians were open to an\nagreement that would fall well short of “liberating Palestine”. Still, Rabin was\nleery. He tried briefly to return the focus to the stalemated Madrid-track talks\nwith the Palestinians. Yet when, with obvious PLO encouragement, the\nPalestinian negotiators stood their ground there, he seemed almost resigned to\nsupporting Oslo. When we discussed it, he used a battlefield metaphor. “When\nyou have to break through, you don’t necessarily know where you’ll succeed.\nYou try several places along the enemy’s lines. In the sector of the front where\nyou do succeed, you send in your other forces.” It was a matter of “reinforcing\nsuccess.”\n\n255\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_028103\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

In addition to its current investments\nin ECE and online curriculum, KUE will seek to expand by acquiring education companies offering\nservices or products that can complement its current offering. KUE believes that owning a diversified\nporticlio of assets in the pre-K-12 education space will allow it to leverage content and best practices\nacross multiple constituencies and to multiple markets. KUE’s strategy in U.S. ECE is to expand its\nexisting platform through the opening of new centers, opportunistic acquisitions of smaller competitors\nand the sale of education-related products and services through existing channels. Internationally, KUE\nhas identified several near-term opportunities fo expand into Europe, the Middle-East and Asia, with some\nof these opportunities in advanced stages of preparation.\n\nManagement has a history of successfully growing through acquisitions. In May 2003, KLC acquired\nAramark Educational Resources (\"AER\"), a company three times its size in terms of revenue.\nManagement completed the integration of AER in approximately 12 months, realizing approximately $10\nmillion in net annual synergies and improving operational performance. In January 2005, the Company\nacquired KinderCare, the largest provider of ECE services in the U.S. at the time. Management achieved\napproximately $25 million in net annualized synergies through the closing of under-performing centers\nand the rationalization cf corporate overhead. In November 2005, KLC separated its education\noperations (KLC OpCo) from its real estate assets (KLC PropCo}. Management believes this division\nallows KLC OpCo management fo focus on the core business of operating and growing the ECE\nbusiness while the maximization of the valuable educational real estate portfolio is managed and\nexpanded by a professional real estate firm, Greenstreet Real Estate Partners (formerly Greenstreet\nRealty Partners, L.P.}, and also represents management's view of KLC’s component businesses.\n\nManagement believes that KUE presents an attractive financial profile with its combination of businesses:\n{i} KLC OpCo, which generated $1.48 billion in pro forma revenue and $150 million in pro forma Adjusted\nEBITDA’ in 2005, is projected to grow organically to $2.3 billion and $320 million by 2011, respectively\nand to generate operating cash flow growing from $72 million in 2005 to $214 million in 2011; (i) a real\nestate portfolio in KLC PropCo that generated an additional $88 million in pro forma EBITDA in 2005; and\n(iii) an investment in k12, which continues to deliver top line growth in excess of 25% and has seen its\nrevenue grow at a 133% compounded annual growth rate over the last three fiscal years (from $6.7\nmillion in 2002 to $85.1 million in 2005).\n\n1.2.

I\nwas criticized for my intrusion into the affairs of my host university. President Lyman went on\nthe radio to attack me:\n\nIt is a myth that all speech is constitutionally protected. No constitutional lawyer in the\nland—no, not even Mr. Dershowitz, the Harvard law professor come to Stanford to save\nus all from sin—not even Mr. Dershowitz could make such a sweeping claim.\n\nI responded with my own statement in the Stanford Daily:\n\nThere are important civil liberties issues at stake in the Franklin firing. If Dr. Lyman\nwants to challenge my view of the Constitution or civil liberties—and those of the\nACLU—I invite that challenge, on its merits.\n\nLyman rejected my invitation to debate and continued to attack me—both personally and through\nhis surrogates—in highly personal terms. The hostility toward me and toward the ACLU spread\nquickly among the established faculty. Not surprisingly, it soon reached the Faculty Committee\nthat was considering the Franklin case.\n\nWe filed a brief on behalf of the ACLU urging Stanford, which is a private university, to apply the\nspirit of the First Amendment to Franklin’s case. The committee agreed and said they were\napplying First Amendment standards, but it ruled, in a divided vote, that Franklin’s speeches\nviolated those standards. They found that he “did intentionally write and urge” students and other\nto “occupy the computation center illegally,” to “disobey the order to disperse” and to “engage in\nconduct which would disrupt activities of the university and threaten injury to individuals and\nproperty.”\n\nFollowing the Franklin firing I gave a lecture on the implications of the case. I predicted that\nFranklin himself would soon be forgotten because his message would be rejected in the free\nmarketplace of ideas. But the Committee’s decision would be long remembered as a leading\nprecedent in the jurisprudence of universities.\n\nI concluded my lecture by pointing an accusing finger at some of the faculty who pretended that\nthe Franklin case raised no important civil liberties issues:\n\nHow often have I heard the absurd remark that Franklin is being fired for what he “did,”\nnot for what he “said,” without a recognition that this quibble doesn’t’ hide the fact what\nhe “did” was to make speeches. How often I have heard the statement that this case does\nnot involve “academic freedom,” it is simply an employer firing an employee for\ndisloyalty—as if a requirement of loyalty and academic freedom were compatible.

Arising to the occasion, I\nwas no longer his teenage sidekick, I was growing into being a young\nwoman and my body was blossoming like never before. Out of the\nawkward stages of my life, 1 now took to looking after myself like never\nbefore. Regular sessions in tanning beds and keeping fit became my life\noutside of Jeffrey. He kept telling me what a beautiful woman I was\ndeveloping into and would offer suggestions to help me look good.\nSending me to dentists for regular teeth whitening consultations or\nhelping me choose my attire for the evening, he was ushering me into a\nwhole new position, training me up for something else, but I was unsure\nof what that was.\n\nBeing a snotty little teenager was a girl of the past. Now I had to be his\neloquent speaking, desirable to all and almost his personal porcelain doll.\nI went everywhere with him again, all of his eclectic dinner parties,\nconferences, and meetings with various members of parliament, famous\ncelebrities, and other esteemed billionaires...most of whom lived by the\nsame rule of thumb as Jeffrey did. Quite an alarming realization having to\naccept this world the way it is. Jeffrey knew all of the right people in this\ngame, and trading girls for favors is how he kept in the circle. He was at\nthe center of it all, blackmail being the only thing next to money with the\nability to pull a many of strings, his conniving ulterior motive was to drag\nall that he could down to his pitiful state of mind. Inviting easily tempted\nacquaintances to his island or his other various residences he would bring\nout the assortment of young girls and pass them around like they were\ncocktails on a platter. No girl had a choice in whom they went with, only\ncompleting a task, we would have to charm and bedazzle these ageing fat\nmen who other than paying for it would’ve never had a shot at getting to\nknow a beautiful girl intimately. I personally belonging to Jeffrey rarely\nhad to be loaned out and it was a big occasion, or should I say favor, if]\nwas. I’ll never really know what made me so important or special to\nJeffrey, it definitely had nothing to do with love. I guess in the end I will\nalways put it down to my capability of being whomever he wanted when\nhe wanted, so compliant it just made it easy for him to have a personal\ntoy at his constant disposal. All I can say is I lived in a jail with no bars,\nand in a country where slavery was supposedly abolished a long time ago\nbut still existed right underneath everybody’s noses. Myself and so many\nother girls were walking proof of it.\n\n89\n\n| Copyright Protected Material\nCONFIDENTIAL GIUFFRE004222\n\nI still was given proper training in massage therapy from time to time,\nkeeping me from looking back at being a teenager with no responsibilities\nto being a young adult with prospering titles. He knew I wanted to be self-\nsufficient so bad I would do anything for it and by giving me this dream\nto hold to only kept me in check. I looked forward to my training\nsessions, holding onto every word passed down to me and after the\nsession was complete I would hurry back to my room and transfer the\ninformation into a workbook with associating exercises.\n\nTrying my new moves on Jeffrey always impressed him, he would get\nexcited hearing about my passion for knowledge and would tell me he\ncould see it transfer into my massages, always giving it my all, my hands\nwere a focused energy when I was at work. Using every ounce of strength\nto apply on a body, many were astounded in what I could do for being\nsuch a small girl, and Jeffrey loved it, using me for a two-hour massage\n“with benefits” sometimes being over twice a day. Ghislane would\nsometimes use me to massage her still but it wasn’t as common, she\npreferred a man for that job.\n\nThen would come the odd client here and there, of course set up by\nJeffrey. Most of which were orchestrated to get beautiful girls\ncomfortable and consequently naked then he would go in for the kill, so\nto speak, touching them intimately, in their most private of places like\ntheir vagina, breasts or anal. When he had us where he wanted, willing\nand able, then would come the toys, outfits and so on. A scheme he has\nused time and time again, telling those who know him well “he had never\nbeen tured down yet”. It was starting to dawn on me how | wasn’t\ngetting any clientele that weren’t used for Jeffrey’s benefit and would\nmake me wonder if I just wasn’t good enough for that, but I kept quiet,\nnever wanting to make waves like I had before.\n\nTo give mea break from it all as if Jeffrey didn’t want to overload me\nagain, he would send me away to his ranch for a few days, what he knew\nI considered being a small slice of heaven on earth. I’d spend my days\nroaming the hills, riding horses, and enjoying the solitude of my own\ncompany. One afternoon I was out exploring the land on Jeffrey’s ranch\nwhich covered hundred’s of acres with nothing but a bottle of water, my\nsketchbook and a small case of oil paint. I was on the search for\nsomething interesting to paint. A great pastime of mine, it made my soul\nquiet by creating beauty with my brush. I loved to recreate the images T\nsaw on paper.

The major-\nity, written by Justice Anthony Kennedy,\nheld that DOMA is unconstitutional as\na deprivation of the liberty of the person\nprotected by the Fifth Amendment of the\n\nConstitution.\n\nThe decision opens the door for same-sex\nmarried couples to enjoy many federal tax-\nrelated benefits previously available only to\nopposite-sex married couples. These include\nincome tax benefits, estate and gift tax ben-\nefits, taxpayer-friendly employee benefits,\nand more. Same-sex couples must now also\ndeal with circumstances under the tax law\nthat may create a so-called “marriage pen-\nalty.””. Employers must prepare for exten-\nsive changes in the treatment of same-sex\ncouples. And individuals claiming tax cred-\nits and other provisions under the Patient\nProtection and Affordable Care Act are im-\npacted by the decision.\n\nIMPACT. Jt is unclear how quickly the\nIRS and other federal agencies will re-\nact to the Supreme Courts decision ...or\nhow quickly same-sex couples may need\nto act to protect certain rights. Presi-\ndent Obama has directed all federal\nagencies, including Treasury and the\nIRS, to revise their regulations to reflect\nthe Supreme Court’ decision as soon as\npossible. Many tax professionals had\nbeen advising same-sex couples to file\nprotective refund claims in anticipation\n\nof a favorable ruling from the Supreme\n\nCourt. This is one of several strategies\nthat practitioners and taxpayers should\nfollow up on, as well as filing amended\nreturns before the applicable limitations\nperiods expire on back tax years. The\ndecision to strike down DOMA goes be-\nyond refunds. Same-sex couples need to\nconsider many other tax implications.\n\nIMPACT. The Supreme Court did not ex-\ntend same-sex marriage nationwide; it de-\nclined to say whether same-sex couples had\na Constitutional right to marriage that\nwould override state law. But the Supreme\nCourts decision has opened up federal\nbenefits —including those under the Inter-\nnal Revenue Code-- to same-sex couples\nconsidered married under state law. The\nWindsor decision leaves many additional\nissues unresolved or unclear. Among them\nare the status of “domestic partnerships”\nand “civil unions” under state law in con-\nnection with federal benefits, the status of\na same-sex couple married in one state but\nnow residing in a state in which same-sex\nmarriage is not recognized, and the abil-\nity of married same-sex couples to divorce\nwithout first moving back to a state that\nrecognizes same-sex marriage.\n\nCAUTION. Jmmediately after the Wind-\nsor decision was released, questions arose\nregarding the impact of residency upon the\nrecognition of marital status for federal tax\npurposes. Will same-sex couples duly mar-\nried in one state who now reside in a state\nthat does not recognize same-sex marriage\nbe entitled to federal benefits, including\nbeing able to file jointly under the federal\ntax laws? ... Or will they be required to file\nas single under federal law as well as state\nlaw?

Numerous headlines of stock market “carnage” have further eroded\ntheir confidence. As a result, some of our clients have asked whether this drop signifies the beginning\nof the end of a nearly 10-year bull market.\nWe do not think so. So far, this pullback is actually smaller than the two prior downdrafts we\nexperienced in late January and in mid-March, neither of which derailed the US economy nor the bull\nmarket. The steady factors we highlighted in our annual Outlook—such as economic growth, benign\ninflation, robust earnings, and low probability of recession—have not dissipated. Furthermore, while\nthe investor focus has shifted to the risks around the unsteady undertow, most of these factors are,\non balance, less concerning today than they were at the beginning of 2018.\nOf course, that is not the case across all geopolitical concerns. While trade tensions with Mexico and\n1\nCanada have abated, those with China have certainly deteriorated and will continue to do so for the\nforeseeable future. But, in aggregate, there has been more improvement than deterioration, in our\nview.\nIn this Sunday Night Insight, we will provide a brief update on the steady factors and unsteady\nundertow. We then conclude with our view that the steady factors will likely continue to win this tug-ofwar\nbetween the two.\nSteady Factors\nWhile the headlines warn of equity market carnage, the facts do not support such alarming headlines.\nThe S&P 500 is still up 5.1% on a year-to-date total return basis and financial conditions remain at\neasier levels today than they did when the Federal Reserve began this tightening cycle in 2015,\ndespite the recent decline in equities and 0.76 percentage point increase in 10-year Treasury yields\nyear-to-date. Most importantly, as highlighted by Federal Reserve Chairman, Jerome Powell, we are\nin “extraordinary times” of steady growth and low inflation.\nEconomic Growth\nEconomic growth remains firm in the US. Both the Institute for Supply Management leading indexes\nfor manufacturing and non-manufacturing remain at very strong levels. Current activity indicators of\nreal GDP growth average about 3.5% for the third quarter and closer to 4% for the fourth quarter.\nForecasts for third quarter real GDP average 3.8% and fourth quarter forecasts are about 2.8%.\nWhile growth is slowing from the 4.2% estimate of the second quarter, it is still forecast to be above\ntrend and we believe a modest slowdown is certainly preferable to continued growth at a pace that\nwas likely unsustainable and possibly even inflationary.\nIn aggregate, the economic data since the intraday peak of US equities on September 21st does not\npoint to any worrisome slowdown in GDP growth or the pace of employment. In fact, while the recent\n134K increase in non-farm payrolls was less than expectations, revisions to earlier months offset the\nmodest headline miss and the unemployment rate still fell to 3.7%. Furthermore, this 134k increase\nis above the estimated sustainable level of employment growth based on population growth and\nchanges in labor force participation, which our colleagues in Goldman Investment Research estimate\nis around 96k. Importantly, a modest slowdown in the 3-month average of non-farm payrolls, which\ncurrently stands at a very robust 190k jobs, is more likely to keep inflation in check.\nRobust Earnings and Buybacks\nContinued above-trend economic growth is supporting solid corporate fundamentals. While many are\nquick to dismiss this strength to US tax reform, it is only half the story. Earnings before interest and\ntaxes (EBIT) expanded by a very healthy 12% in the first half of this year and are expected to grow by\ndouble-digits again in the third quarter. This robust organic profit growth is also fueling sizable\ncorporate buybacks—a key source of equity market support. Our colleagues on the corporate\nbuyback desk expect the highest dollar amount for buybacks on record in 2018, with $1tn in\nauthorizations and $850bn in executed buybacks.\n2\nTotal Return (%)\nEven so, such robust earnings growth has begun to foster concern that we have reached a peak in\nEPS growth. While we do expect the pace of growth to slow next year, a local peak in earnings\ngrowth has not signified an imminent peak in the S&P 500 historically. In fact, about 3/4ths of market\npeaks occurred more than two years after the peak in the growth rate of earnings. Moreover, stock\nmarket returns have remained healthy during this period, with high odds of a positive outcome over\nthe subsequent 6-24 months (see Exhibit 1). In short, the market ultimately follows the path of\nearnings and while their growth rate may be slowing, their absolute level is still rising.\n1.

In\nfact, some of the most recent data released in October have ticked slightly lower. Average hourly\nearnings dropped to 2.8% from the prior month’s level of 2.9%. Headline CPI dropped to 2.3% from\n2.7% and Core CPI ex-food and energy remain at a low 2.2%, unchanged from the prior month. The\nFederal Reserve’s preferred inflation indicator, Core PCE, also remains low at 2.0% which is in line\nwith the Federal Reserve’s target, and unchanged from the prior month.\nWhile 10-year Treasury yields have risen by 0.76% (or 76 basis points) over the course of 2018, we\ndo not think the resulting 3.2% yield is enough to derail US economic growth. Keep in mind that most\nof the recent increase since late August was due to stronger real growth rather than runaway inflation\nexpectations. We expect interest rates to range between 3.0% and 3.5% in 2019 with a midpoint of\n3.25%, barring any major geopolitical conflicts such as one between US and China and or escalating\nconflicts in the Middle East.\n3\nYoY %\n2.

First, the 4% trend growth rate of nominal US GDP—\nreflecting 2% real growth and 2% inflation—remains comfortably above the 10-year Treasury yield of\n4\nUS 10-Year Treasury Yield (%)\n3.2% (i.e. the cost of borrowing). Stocks typically struggle when the cost of borrowing exceeds the\nnominal growth of the economy (see Exhibit 4). Second, the recent backup in interest rates was\ndriven primarily by improving real growth expectations, not higher inflation. This distinction is critical,\nbecause higher rates in response to improving real growth tend to benefit earnings sufficiently to\novercome the downward pressure they place on valuation multiples. Finally, it will take a number of\nyears before higher rates meaningfully impact aggregate S&P 500 interest expense, considering 91%\nof S&P 500 debt is fixed-rate and only 13% matures over the next two years.\n4.

We believe that\nFederal Reserve Chairman Powell’s recent commentary indicates that the FOMC will continue\nto be driven by data and financial market conditions. Their stated goal is to extend this\nexpansion “indefinitely.” 1 While the Federal Reserve dots point towards four more interest rate\nhikes by the end of 2019, we do not think that such hikes materially increase the odds of a\nrecession in an economy that continues to grow at levels that are generally regarded as above\ntrend growth in the US.\nRecent steepening of the yield curve. We have highlighted two measures of the yield curve as\nsign-posts we watch as an early harbinger of a recession. Both have steepened since their\nlows, as shown in Exhibits 5 and 6.\n5\nSpread (%)\nSpread (%)\n5.

Potential US retaliation over the recent disappearance of a\nSaudi journalist has only added fuel to the fire of worries given the risk that oil exports could be used\nas a political weapon in a world with tighter oil supply thanks to impending US sanctions on Iran.\nAs we review the geopolitical developments of 2018, it is clear that some of the risks have abated\nwhile others have increased. With the exception of a significant spike in oil prices due to the impact of\nsanctions on Iran or any escalation in US-Saudi tensions, we believe that the net impact of these\nshifts is not material enough to derail the US economic expansion or bull market.\nRisks that have abated\nMexico: the election of the left-of-center populist president (Andrés Manuel Lopes Obrador referred\nto as AMLO) has reduced fear of a reversal of recent reforms. While concerns about fiscal profligacy\nand reverting to a nationalist energy policy that reduces oil production may reappear, AMLO does not\ntake office until the end of the year.\nBrazil: The strong showing of Jair Bolsonaro, a law-and-order former army captain, in the first round\nof elections and the latest data that points to a 75% probability of Bolsonaro becoming the next\npresident of Brazil has provided a boost to the Brazilian real. His current standing has substantially\nreduced the election of another left-wing worker’s party candidate who would keep the status quo in\nBrazil.\nNAFTA: The agreement on a revised NAFTA deal between the US, Canada, and Mexico on\nSeptember 30th meaningfully reduced the risk of the US withdrawal from NAFTA. While the new\nagreement, US-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), has not been ratified by the Mexican and\nCanadian national parliaments nor by the US congress, and a divided congress after the mid-term\nelections may lead to some uncertainty, we believe it is likely to be ratified.\nUS-EU Trade Friction: Tension between the US and European Union eased significantly after a July\n2018 deal between European Commission President Juncker and President Trump to “work together\ntoward zero tariffs, zero non-tariff barriers and zero subsidies on non-auto industrial goods”. The\ncoast is not totally clear given the threat of auto tariffs, but we do not anticipate any significant\nincrease in trade rhetoric in the near future.\nRisks that have increased\nChina: The trade war with China continues to escalate and as we have stated before, we believe that\nit cannot be resolved simply by China importing more US goods. The issues range from:\n�\n�\n�\nA large and growing trade deficit with China\nIndustrial policies & unfair trade practices that reduce competition, such as subsidies and\n“dumping good at below-market prices”\n“Made in China 2025” policies which “harm US companies”\n7\nPrice Indexed to 12/31/2017\n�\n�\n�\n�\n�\n�\nUneven tariff rates and the banning of some US goods\nIntellectual property theft\nForced technology transfer\nStrategic US technology acquisitions\nOutright cyber theft\nForeign ownership restrictions\nRecent headlines that the trade war may be escalating to a cold war are not without merit, as we\nbelieve that US-China relations are changing on a more structural basis and will have a longer-term\nimpact. On a short-term basis, however, US exposure to China is limited with merchandise exports,\ncorporate profits and foreign claims at about 1% of GDP. As seen in Exhibit 7, the Chinese equity\nmarkets have also deteriorated much more significantly than US markets in 2018.\nOf course, specific stocks with greater exposure to China through higher sales have underperformed\nthe S&P 500 by about 6% since the latest tariffs were imposed on $200bn of Chinese products, as\nshown in Exhibit 8.\n7.

The government’s\nexpansive fiscal plan, with a proposed budget deficit of 2.4% of GDP, may be rejected by the\nEuropean Union commission and result in rating downgrades. While the EU is likely to manage this\nsituation in its usual incremental and reactive way, the possibility of new elections in late 2019\nreigniting euro viability questions will keep Italy on our radar screens.\nBREXIT: It is hard to know whether Brexit risks are unchanged, higher or lower given the minute by\nminute headlines out of the UK. Our base case remains that while the internal politics of the\nConservative party will keep uncertainty at elevated levels and the European Union will not\ncompromise on its key tenants of free movement of goods, services, and people, the two sides will\nagree to a deal that defers the difficult choices on the shape of a final agreement with the EU until late\n2020.\nThe Middle East: Risks in the Middle East have not changed substantially with respect to Iraq, Syria,\nor even the impositions of sanctions on Iran. However, the disappearance of the Saudi journalist who\nentered the Saudi Embassy in Turkey on October 2 nd has the potential to raise risks to global oil\nsupply. While there has been a global uproar, it is not yet clear whether the US will impose serious\nsanctions or Saudi Arabia would retaliate by reducing oil exports if the US finds sufficient evidence\nregarding the alleged killing of the Saudi journalist. The recession in 1973-74 was partly due to the\nquadrupling of oil prices due to the Arab Oil Embargo. Later in that decade, the Iranian Revolution\nand the Iran-Iraq War also led to a 2.5 times spike in oil prices that, along with Federal Reserve\ntightening by then Chairman Paul Volcker, led to a US recession. While we think it is unlikely that\nSaudi Arabia would react so aggressively in the face of serious US reprisals, we note that it remains a\nreal risk.\n9\nCumulative Mutual Fund and ETF Flows ($Bn)\nSome Notable Observations\nUS Equities Have Been Shunned All Along\nIn both our 2018 Outlook and mid-year update, we highlighted the surprising absence of inflows into\nUS equities based on flows into mutual funds and Exchange-Traded Funds. As shown in Exhibit 9,\nflows into US equities were negative in 2018, even before the recent downdraft. In fact, US equities\nhave seen outflows of $81 billion through August 2018 (based on the most recent comprehensive\ndata), while non-US developed equities and emerging market equities have had inflows of $72 billion\nand $20 billion respectively. This is further evidence of our view that while sentiment and short term\npositioning among speculators and hedge fund managers shifts frequently, more stable investors\nhave shunned US equities during this long bull market in favor of other developed and emerging\nmarket equities and global bonds.\nThis steady outflow of assets from US equities has been offset by record levels of stock buybacks by\nUS companies given high levels of profitability and incremental cash from repatriation of overseas\nearnings, as mentioned above.\n9.

Even so, each of the\nstocks, with the exception of Facebook, still have positive year-to-date returns and have outperformed\nthe S&P 500, as shown in Exhibit 10.\n10\n10.

Anyone looking to buy or sell single name\nequities should consult Goldman Sachs Global Investment Research.\nSource: Investment Strategy Group, Bloomberg.\nNevertheless, we believe that some of the headwinds that have plagued this sector will continue.\nThese include:\n�\n�\n�\nData privacy issues impacting a broad range of companies, including Facebook, Google,\nTwitter, Alipay and Tencent.\nHigh likelihood of greater regulatory scrutiny in the US 2 and Europe as policy makers\nincreasingly believe that these companies will not address “the privacy and security issues of\nsocial media users” 3 on their own.\nIncreased focus by ESG investors (Environment, Social, and Governance) that many of the\ntechnology and social media companies are falling short on social and governance issues.\nWhile this basket of stocks may or may not lead the market in the future, it is important to note that\nthey represent only 10% of S&P 500 earnings.\nInvestment Implications\nThe recent market downdraft has understandably rekindled fears that the longest bull market in\nhistory is coming to an end. While there are no certainties in investing, we do not think the odds\nsupport that conclusion based on our read of the steady and unsteady factors discussed above. Keep\nin mind that about 75% of historical US bear markets—defined here as equity market declines of 20%\nor more—have occurred during economic recessions. In fact, US equity returns have remained\nfavorable until about five to six months prior to the onset of recession, highlighting the penalty for\nprematurely exiting the market (see Exhibit 11). With only 10% odds of recession over the next year,\nwe think the economic backdrop remains favorable for stocks.\n11\nAverage 6m Price Return\n% of Positive Price Returns\n11.

Yet these statistics alone do not justify underweighting\nequities, since such pullbacks often occur after sizable equity rallies, as this year reminds us.\nMoreover, such pullbacks are quite normal historically. After all, stocks have suffered a median of two\npullbacks of at least 5% and one of at least 10% per calendar year in the post-WWII period, leaving\nboth the frequency and magnitude of this year’s dips in line with past experience. Most importantly,\nyears that experienced a similar number of pullbacks as 2018 nonetheless ended with a median gain\nof 6% and had 77% odds of a positive return.\nConclusion\nAlthough we have painted a less alarmist view of recent market weakness, we are by no means\nPollyannaish. While bull markets do not die of old age, they do become more susceptible to ailments\nover time. Yet as we survey the tug of war between the steady factors and the unsteady undertow,\nwe do not think the balance of risks is strong enough to topple the ongoing US expansion and the\ncontinued growth of corporate earnings it supports.\nThat said, this viewpoint does not preclude further market volatility and the market may still make new\nlows if the current downdraft persists. But history suggests the bull market is likely to continue until\nabout 5-6 months prior to the end of this economic expansion. Thus, it will take a significant increase\nin the odds of an imminent recession to provide the trigger—that has been lacking thus far—to\ntactically underweight equities. In the interim, we continue to recommend that clients maintain their\nstrategic allocation to US equities.\n12\nSources: Investment Strategy Group, Bank for International Settlements, Bloomberg, Datastream, Goldman Sachs Global\nInvestment Research, Haver, International Monetary Fund, Teneo Intelligence.\nEndnotes:\n(1) Kate Davidson and Sarah Chaney, “Fed Chair Powell Sees ‘Remarkably Positive Set of Economic\nCircumstances,’” The Wall Street Journal, October 3, 2018.\n(2) Statement by the Acting Director of FTC’s Bureau of Consumer Protection Regarding Reported Concerns about\nFacebook Privacy Practices, March 26, 2018.\n(3) Senator Mark.

Fur-\nthermore, if a key neuron is removed, the glocal Hopfield net algorithm will eventually learn it\nback, so the robustness properties of Hopfield nets are retained.\n\nThe results of experimenting with glocal Hopfield nets of this nature are summarized in\n[GPI* 10]. We studied Hopfield nets with connectivity around .1, and in this context we found\nthat glocality\n\ne slightly increased memory capacity\ne massively increased the rate of convergence to the attractor, i.e. the speed of recall\n\nHowever, probably the most important consequence of glocality is a more qualitative one: it\nmakes it far easier to link the Hopfield net into a larger system, as would occur if the Hopfield net\nwere embedded in an integrative AGI architecture. Because a neuron external to the Hopfield\nnet may now link to a memory in the Hopfield net by linking to the corresponding key neuron.\n\n13.6.4 Neural-Symbolic Glocality in CogPrime\n\nIn CogPrime, we have explicitly sought to span the symbolic/emergentist pseudo-dichotomy,\nvia creating an integrative knowledge representation that combines logic-based aspects with\nneural-net-like aspects. As reviewed in Chapter 6 above, these function not in the manner of\nmultimodular systems, but rather via using (probabilistic) truth values and (attractor neural\nnet like) attention values as weights on nodes and links of the same (hyper) graph. The nodes\nand links in this hypergraph are typed, like a standard semantic network approach for knowl-\nedge representation, so they’re able to handle all sorts of knowledge, from the most concrete\nperception and actuation related knowledge to the most abstract relationships. But they’re also\nweighted with values similar to neural net weights, and pass around quantities (importance\nvalues, discussed in Chapter 23 of Part 2) similar to neural net activations, allowing emergent\nattractor /assembly based knowledge representation similar to attractor neural nets.\n\nThe concept of glocality lies at the heart of this combination, in a way that spans the pseudo-\ndichotomy:\n\ne Local knowledge is represented in abstract logical relationships stored in explicit logical\nform, and also in Hebbian-type associations between nodes and links.\n\ne Global knowledge is represented in large-scale patterns of node and link weights, which\nlead to large-scale patterns of network activity, which often take the form of attractors\nqualitatively similar to Hopfield net attractors. These attractors are called maps.\n\nThe result of all this is that a concept like “cat” might be represented as a combination of:\n\ne A small number of logical relationships and strong associations, that constitute the “key”\nsubnetwork for the “cat” concept.\n\ne A large network of weak associations, binding together various nodes and links of various\ntypes and various levels of abstraction, representing the “cat map”.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_013185\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

Warner\nMay 22, 2017\n\nPage 2\n\nthe witness.3 And, as courts have repeatedly held, the protection offered by the Fifth\nAmendment privilege extends to producing documents where the act of production itself is\ntestimonial in nature.\n\nThe context in which the Committee has called for General Flynn’s testimonial\nproduction of documents makes clear that he has more than a reasonable apprehension that any\ntestimony he provides could be used against him. Multiple Members of Congress have\ndemanded that he be investigated and even prosecuted. He is the target on nearly a daily basis of\noutrageous allegations, often attributed to anonymous sources in Congress or elsewhere in the\nUnited States Government, which, however fanciful on their face and unsubstantiated by\nevidence, feed the escalating public frenzy against him.4 Additionally, in the intervening time\nsince the Committee issued its subpoena, the Department of Justice has appointed a special\ncounsel to investigate these and related matters. This environment creates a “reasonable cause\nto apprehend danger,” giving rise to a constitutional right not to testify. A detailed explanation\nof the legal basis for respectfully declining to comply with the Committee’s requests follows\nbelow.5\n\nThe Fifth Amendment Privilege Bars Congress From Compelling A Witness to Provide\nTestimony Through The Act of Producing Documents\n\nThe Fifth Amendment protects an individual from being “compelled in any criminal case\nto be a witness against himself.” U.S. Const. amend. V. This privilege applies in congressional\ninvestigations. In Watkins v. United States, Chief Justice Warren stressed that “the\nconstitutional rights of witnesses will be respected by the Congress as they are in a court of\njustice. ... Witnesses cannot be compelled to give evidence against themselves.” 354 U.S. 178,\n187-88 (1957). The Supreme Court later held in United States v. Hubbell, 530 U.S. 27, 34\n(2000), that the right not to be compelled to give testimony against oneself applies as well to the\ncompelled production of documents that would be “testimonial” in nature.

He may be rich, but he\nis without institutional protection or bona fides. He is a questionable\nsubstrata of wealth. He’s a freelancer.\n\nIn the Epstein telling, he’s representing a series of vastly wealthy\npeople and families.\n\nIn a sense, he’s their instrument, doing their bidding, and for a period\ndescribes himself as recovering money, as something like a private\ndetective. If early in his career he might seem like a sort of George Peppard\n(there’s a resemblance) in Breakfast at Tiffany’s, a charming hustler, later\nhe’s George Peppard in Banacek, a smart and astute operator.\n\nHe steps up his game and his relationship with the rich.

Graydon Carter, into his\nsecond years as editor of Vanity Fair, is also at the dinner. Epstein’s rise and\nCarter’s rise are not, with a little critical interpretation, that different. Both\nare a function of the age of new money, and both are helped by strategic\nrelationships with the exceptionally wealthy.

SMEPH does not add anything to\nthe patternist view on a philosophical level, but it gives a concrete instantiation to some of the\ngeneral ideas of patternism. In this section we’ll articulate some \"SMEPH principles\", consti-\ntuting important ideas from patternist philosophy as they manifest themselves in the SMEPH\ncontext.\n\nThe logical edges in a SMEPH hypergraph are weighted with probabilities, as in the simple\nexample given above. The functional edges may be probabilistically weighted as well, since some\nSchema may give certain results only some of the time. These probabilities are critical in terms\nof SMEPH’s model of system dynamics; they underly one of our SMEPH principles,\n\nPrinciple of Implicit Probabilistic Inference: In an intelligent system, the temporal\nevolution of the probabilities on the edges in the system’s derived hypergraph should approxi-\nmately obey the rules of probability theory.\n\nThe basic idea is that, even if a system - through its underlying dynamics - has no explicit\nconnection to probability theory, it still must behave roughly as if it does, if it is going to be\nintelligent. The roughly part is important here; it’s well known that humans are not terribly\naccurate in explicitly carrying out formal probabilistic inferences. And yet, in practical contexts\nwhere they have experience, humans can make quite accurate judgments; which is all that’s\nrequired by the above principle, since it’s the contexts where experience has occurred that will\nmake up a system’s derived hypergraph.\nOur next SMEPH principle is evolutionary, and states\n\nPrinciple of Implicit Evolution: In an intelligent system, new Schema and Concepts will\ncontinually be created, and the Schema and Concepts that are more useful for achieving system\ngoals (as demonstrated via probabilistic implication of goal achievement) will tend to survive\nlonger.\n\nNote that this principle can be fulfilled in many different ways. The important thing is that\nsystem goals are allowed to serve as a selective force.\n\nAnother SMEPH dynamical principle pertains to a shorter time-scale than evolution, and\nstates\n\nPrinciple of Attention Allocation: In an intelligent system, Schema and Concepts that\nare more useful for attaining short-term goals will tend to consume more of the system’s energy.\n(The balance of attention oriented toward goals pertaining to different time scales will vary from\nsystem to system.)\n\nNext, there is the\nPrinciple of Autopoesis: In an intelligent system, if one removes some part of the system\nand then allows the system’s natural dynamics to keep going, a decent approximation to that\n\nremoved part will often be spontaneously reconstituted.\n\nAnd there is the\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_013191\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

However, as Windsor showed, it is\na valuable tax benefit for larger estates.\n\nMany same-sex married couples may find\nit valuable to revisit their estate plans to\n\nmake certain that interests passing to the\nother spouse qualify for the marital de-\n\nduction and other tax benefits.\n\nPortability. The American Taxpayer Relief\nAct of 2012 extended permanently the con-\ncept of portability, which generally allows\nthe estate of a surviving spouse to utilize the\nunused portion of the estate tax applicable\nexclusion amount of his or her last prede-\nceased spouse. Because of DOMA, only\nopposite-sex married couples could take ad-\nvantage of portability.\n\nIMPACT. The Supreme Courts decision\npresumably enables same-sex married\ncouples to take advantage of portability as\npart of their estate planning. The IRS is\n\nexpected to issue guidance.\n\nGifts. Because of DOMA, only opposite-\nsex married couples were allowed to “split”\ngifts to take advantage of a doubled annual\ngift tax exclusion ($14,000 for 2013, for\na total tax-free gift of $28,000). DOMA\npresented even more of a disadvantage\nfor same-sex married couples in that only\ntransfers between spouses, where both in-\ndividuals are U.S. citizens, are allowed an\nunlimited gift tax exclusion under Code\nSec. 2523.\n\nIMPACT. Same-sex married couples can\nnow presumably transfer assets between\nthemselves with no concern of lifetime gift\ntax consequences. This creates consider-\nably greater flexibility for estate planning.\nThe IRS is expected to issue guidance.\n\nCOMMENT. Gifts to cover medical and\neducation expenses for an individual, if\npaid directly to the medical or education\nprovider, are gift tax free without limit\nand are not counted against the annual\n$14,000 exclusion for any individual.\n\nCOMMENT. Where one Spouse is not a\nU.S. citizen, the annual exclusion from\n\ngift taxes for gifts made to the noncitizen\nspouse is $143,000 for 2013.\n\nEMPLOYEE BENEFITS\n\nPerhaps in no area outside of income taxes is\nthe impact of the Supreme Court’s decision\nmore expansive than on employee benefits.\nBecause of DOMA, employers that allow an\nemployee to add his or her same-sex spouse\nto their health plan had to impute income\nto the employee for federal income tax pur-\nposes equal to the fair market value of health\ncoverage provided to the same-sex spouse.\nIf the same-sex spouse qualified as a depen-\ndent, this rule did not apply. DOMA also\nprecluded same-sex married couples from\nsharing the same benefits of health flexible\nspending accounts, health savings accounts\nand health reimbursement arrangements\navailable to opposite-sex married couples.\n\nIMPACT. Employers in states that allow\nsame-sex marriage will presumably need\nto amend plans to cover same-sex married\nspouses. The IRS is expected to provide guid-\nance on the timing of plan amendments, in-\ncluding the issue of whether benefits need to\nbe made retroactive or only prospective from\n\nthe date of the Windsor decision.\n\nDomestic Partners. Many employee ben-\nefit plans in the private and public sectors\nrefer to domestic partners rather than same-\nThe definition of domestic\n\nIn some cases, it may en-\n\nSex spouses.\npartner varies.\ncompass opposite-sex domestic partners as\nwell as same-sex domestic partners.\n\nCOMMENT. The federal governments\nOffice of Personnel Management defines\ndomestic partner for purposes of federal\nemployee benefits as a committed relation-\nship between two adults, of the same sex.\n\nTax Treatment. Domestic partners who are\nnot married under state law are not treated\nas spouses for federal income tax purposes.\nAs a result, an employee must continue\nto pay taxes on the fair market value of\nthe coverage for the employee's domestic\npartner (whether the domestic partner is a\n\nsame-sex partner or an opposite-sex part-\nner). However, domestic partner benefits\nare tax-free if the employee's partner quali-\nfies as a dependent under Code Sec. 152;\nthat is, if benefits are paid for a person who\nmeets the following requirements:\n\nm Receives more than half of his or her\nsupport from the taxpayer for the year.\n\nm Uses the taxpayer's home as the principal\nabode and is a member of the taxpayer's\nhousehold during the entire tax year.\n\nm Is in a relationship with the taxpayer\nthat is not a violation of local law.\n\nIMPACT. The Supreme Courts decision\nmay open the window to refunds of taxes\npaid by employees on income imputed to\nemployees for same-sex married spouse\nand refunds of payroll taxes paid by em-\nployers on that income. FICA tax refund\nclaims by employers and employees for\nprior, open years may also be possible.\n\nCOMMENT. Some employers have at-\ntempted to equalize the treatment be-\ntween opposite-sex couples and same-sex\ncouples by providing so-called gross-ups\nto cover the additional taxes that same-\nsex couples pay on health benefits. Many\nemployers require an employee to certify\nthat a domestic partner qualifies as a de-\npendent under Code Sec. 152.\n\nCafeteria Plans. Employer contributions to\na cafeteria plan are usually made under a sal-\nary reduction agreement between the employer\nand the employee in which the employee agrees\nto contribute a portion of his or her salary on\na pre-tax basis to pay for the qualified benefits.\nSalary reduction contributions are not actually\nor constructively received by the participant.\nTherefore, those contributions are not consid-\nered wages for federal income tax purposes. In\naddition, those sums generally are not subject to\nFICA and FUTA taxes. However, pre-tax dol-\nlars could not be used to pay for coverage of a\nsame-sex spouse because of DOMA.

Rajesh De, the NSA’s general counsel at\nthe time of the Snowden breach, described the NSA as becoming by\n2013 “one of the most regulated enterprises in the world.” Grafted\nonto its intelligence activities were layers of mandated reporting to\noversight officials. Not only did the NSA have its own chief compli-\nance officer, chief privacy and civil liberties officer, and independent\ninspector general, but the NSA also had to report to a different set\nof compliance officers at the Department of Defense, the Office of\nthe Director of National Intelligence, and the Department of Justice.\nAdditionally, the Department of Justice dispatched a team of lawyers\nevery sixty days to review the results of “every single tasking deci-\nsion” approved by the FISA court.\n\n© According to De, just assembling these reports involved thousands ©\nof hours of manpower.

You would not be able \nto do a competing book or documentary before then. This is not to say that they shouldn't be pursued. In a \nsense, better that they know what Patterson's position is and, a year from now say, be able to counter it. I have \nsome thoughts on book and doc to share at your convenience. \nThat being said, you do need an immediate counter narrative to the book. I believe Trump offers an ideal \nopportunity. It's a chance to make the story about something other than you, while, at the same time, letting you \nframe your own story. Also, becoming an anti-Trump voice gives you a certain political cover which you \ndecidedly don't have now. Still, this necessary involves you going public. And so the most basic decision is \nabout your willingness to do that. My view is that in a couple of weeks you could master message and technical \nproficiency. I know a bunch of people who could be very helpful here. This would involve something along the \nlines of you writing an op-ed, doing a high profile television interview (Charlie Rose, I'd say), and perhaps \nsome social media efforts. \nSpeaking of which, again, I think a strategic plan, involving your public identity, philanthropic activities and \ninterests, and the development of media allies, ought finally to be put in place. A big, comprehensive, expensive \neffort. \nThe alternative is to continue to keep head down and hope Patterson book is just more he-said she-said and \nConnolly getting lost in the reeds (which, as an inveterate conspiracist, he always does). My worry is that \nPatterson can be counted on to produce a bestseller, and while he isn't regarded as a serious writer, he'll surely \nbe unloading a lot of tabloid copy. Because this will be tied to the election, the Trump-Clinton angle will amp \nup the attention 10-fold, in fact, possibly, a hundred fold. Possibly more than anything you've encountered \nbefore. \nMeanwhile--\nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 032246 \nIn a lawyer's letter, I'd suggest including the following points--not necessarily legal, but a warning about how a \npress campaign might unfold (publishers are more worried about being caught in negative media controversy \nthan they are of legal threats): \n1) Little, Brown has made on the record representations to at least one well-known journalist that it was not \npublishing a book by James Patterson about Jeffrey Epstein--possibly an effort to avoid inquiries about the \nquestionable nature of the book; \n2) The actual author of the book, John Connolly, is someone other than the stated author, James Patterson. \nConnolly is known to have developed an obsession with Epstein, such that, his longtime employer, Vanity Fair, \nhas refused to allow him to write about Epstein for the magazine; \n3) Sources have confirmed for us that Patterson has had little more than a minimal consulting role in the book, \nand that Connolly has functioned in every material way as the book's researcher and writer. We believe \nPatterson's \"authorship\" of the book will not stand up to scrutiny. And, indeed, that the entire notion of an \nextension of the Patterson franchise into nonfiction, as it has been used in fiction and children's book--\neffectively other authors writing under the Patterson name—presents a host of journalism ethical issues. \nplease note \nThe information contained in this communication is \nconfidential, may be attorney-client privileged, may \nconstitute inside information, and is intended only for \nthe use of the addressee.

Can you do everything I’ve done with a boss? No. Can you use the same principles to\ndouble your income, cut your hours in half, or at least double the usual vacation time’? Most definitely.\n\nHere is the step-by-step process you'll use to reinvent yourself:\n\nD for Definition turns misguided common sense upside down and introduces the rules and objectives of\nthe new game.

His current misery was both Catholic in nature—the\nself-flagellation of a man who believed he lived on a higher moral plane than all others—\nand fundamentally misanthropic. As an antisocial, maladjusted, post-middle-aged man, he\nhad to make a supreme effort to get along with others, an effort that often did not go well.\nMost especially, he was miserable because of Donald Trump, whose cruelties, always\ngreat even when they were casual, were unbearable when he truly turned against you.\n\n“T hated being on the campaign, I hated the transition, I hate being here in the White\nHouse,” said Bannon, sitting one evening in Reince Priebus’s office, on an unseasonably\nwarm evening in early spring, with the French doors open to the arbor-covered patio\nwhere he and Priebus, now firm friends and allies in their antipathy toward Jarvanka, had\nset an outdoor table.\n\nBut Bannon was, he believed, here for a reason. And it was his firm belief—a belief he\nwas unable to keep to himself, thus continually undermining his standing with the\npresident—that his efforts had brought everybody else here. Even more important, he was\nthe only person showing up for work every day who was committed to the purpose of\nactually changing the country.

But Bannon believed the split was literal. The United States had become\na country of two hostile peoples. One would necessarily win and the other lose. Or one\nwould dominate while the other would become marginal.\n\nThis was modern civil war—Bannon’s war.

It is not just\nthat their curricula have been copied around the world; the entire ecosystem\nof a modern research university is being replicated, and it is the graduates of\nthese Western-style universities who have in turn introduced modern\nmethods into education, public health, economic management, and public\npolicy more generally.

One of the most common routes, known as “buffer overrun,” involves an input\nnumber (or long string of characters) that is bigger than the programmer expected and\noverflows into where the instructions are stored. By carefully designing an input number\nthat is too big by far, someone using a piece of software can infect it with instructions not\nintended by the programmer, and thus change what it does. This is the basis for creating\na computer virus—so named for its similarity to a biological virus. The latter injects\nextra DNA into a cell, and that cell’s transcription and translation mechanism blindly\ninterprets it, making proteins that may be harmful to the host cell. Furthermore, the\nreplication mechanism for the cell takes care of multiplying the virus. Thus, a small\nforeign entity can take control of a much bigger entity and bend its behavior in\nunexpected ways.\n\nThese and other forms of digital attacks have taken the security of our everyday\nlives from us. We rely on computers for almost everything now. We rely on computers\nfor our infrastructure of electricity, gas, roads, cars, trains, and airplanes; these are all\nvulnerable. We rely on computers for our banking, our payment of bills, our retirement\naccounts, our mortgages, our purchasing of goods and services—these, too, are all\nvulnerable. We rely on computers for our entertainment, our communications both\nbusiness and personal, our physical security at home, our information about the world,\nand our voting systems—all vulnerable. None of this will get fixed anytime soon. In the\nmeantime, many aspects of our society are open to vicious attacks, whether by\nfreelancing criminals or nation-state adversaries.\n\nThe second development is that computation has gone beyond simply computing\nfunctions. Instead, programs remain online continuously, and so they can gather data\nabout a sequence of queries. Under the Wiener/Turing/von Neumann scheme, we might\nthink of the communication pattern for a Web browser to be:\n\nUser: Give me Web page A.\nBrowser: Here is Web page A.\n\nUser: Give me Web page B.\nBrowser: Here is Web page B.\n\nNow instead it can look like this:\n\nUser: Give me Web page A.\nBrowser: Here is Web page A.

That came a few weeks\nlater from one of the kibbutz elders. He simply took me by the shoulders and\nshouted: “You must never do this again.”\n\nIt was worse for my parents. At first, they believed I was an innocent party.\nThey were convinced I couldn’t have got involved in something like this\nwithout being dragged in by the others. My father even asked me whether the\nreason I’d been “drafted” by Ido and Moshe was because I was small, and able\nto squeeze through tight spaces in windows and doors. As it happened, that did\nsometimes come in handy. But I told them, no, I was not an unlucky bystander.\nI was as much a part of it as the others. My father was angrier than I had ever\nseen him. My mother, faced with what must have seemed like a betrayal of\nevery one of her Zionist principles, told me that if the kibbutz had decided to\nreport us to the police, she would not have objected.\n\nTheir mood lifted slightly when I began my final year of high school in\nSeptember 1958. After two years back in the kibbutz school, our age-group was\nsent out again in another shift in policy. This one was in response to signs of\ngrowing support in Mishmar Hasharon and other kibbutzim for the argument\nmy father had made against the quality of education we were offering. In order\nto go at least some way toward meeting that objection, Mishmar Hasharon was\nbanding together with two dozen other kibbutzim and sending all 12\"-graders to\none of two outside high schools. The first, called Beit Berl, was a Labor Zionist\ninstitution focusing on the humanities. In addition to a few of the less academic\nboys, most of the girls were sent there. The rest of us went to a place called\nRupin. It was a few hundred yards past the regional high school. It specialized\nin agriculturally related scientific research.\n\nA few of the teachers were enormously gifted, and they were in the areas\nthat most interested me: math, physics and biology. Yet the rest of the\ncurriculum was almost numbingly uninspiring. I did not miss a single math or\nscience class. But otherwise, I began setting my own schedule. Some days, I\nwould sleep late, or not go at all. When I did go, I’d often show up without\nhaving done the homework. Neither Ido nor Moshe was with me at Rupin. They\nwere starting their military service. But I assembled a new band of mischief-\nmakers, and it was not hard to entice them to go AWOL.\n\nI was warned several times by the school administrator.

The game-changing\nevent in the first decade of this century was that the number of\nchildren stopped growing. Two-child families are now the norm\nfor 80% of mankind. The fast population growth will be over\naround 2050 and at that point only 10% of the 10 billion in the\nworld will live in what was the West. Demographics are major\nchangers of the market place.\nMy second bet is the G20 meeting in Washington 2008.\nAs the richest needed to borrow money they asked the emerging\neconomies to join and changed their name from G7 to G20.\nThe official photo of the heads of state tells the story. In the\nmiddle stands the host, President George W. Bush.

If there was going to be an Israel — if\nthere was going to be a Mishmar Hasharon — we had to win and the Arabs had\nto lose. At first, even the fact our kibbutz had been given a share of the land of\nWadi Khawaret seemed just another product of the war. After all, Ben-Gurion\nhad accepted the plan for two states. The Arabs had said no, deciding to attack\nus instead. Someone had to farm the land. Why not us?\n\nYet events after the war did lead me to begin to ask myself questions of\nbasic fairness, and whether we were being faithful to some of the high-sounding\nideals I heard spoken about with such pride on the kibbutz. The Palestinians\nwere not the only refugees. More than 600,000 Jews fled into Israel from Arab\ncountries where they had lived for generations. More than 100,000 arrived from\nIraq, and several hundred thousand from Morocco, Tunisia and Algeria in north\nAfrica. Immediately after the war, about 50,000 were airlifted out of Yemen,\nwhere they had endured violent attacks ever since the UN partition vote.\n\nThe reality that greeted the Yemenis in Israel was more complex. Most were\ninitially settled in tented transit camps. I’m not sure how several dozen Yemeni\nfamilies made their way to Wadi Khawaret, but it made sense for them to move\ninto the village’s vacant homes. It was empty except for several deserted\nbuildings which we and other kibbutzim began using for storage and, later, for\nour transport co-operative. Yet a few nights after the Yemenis moved in, a\nposse of young men, including some from Mishmar Hasharon, descended on\nthem and, armed with clubs and wooden staves, drove them away.\n\nI was shocked. I’d seen the photos in Davar le Yeladim celebrating the\nairlift, with the Yemenis kissing the airport tarmac in relief, gratitude and joy at\nfinding refuge in the new Israeli state. Now, for the “crime” of moving into a\nrow of empty buildings in search of a decent place to live, they’d been beaten\nup and chased away. By us. I realized Wadi Khawaret no longer belonged to the\nArabs. But, surely, our kibbutz had no more right to the buildings than Jews\nwho had fled from Yemen and needed them a lot more than we did. For days, I\ntried to discover who had joined the vigilante attack. Though everyone seemed\nto know what had happened, no one talked about it.

AT&T says it wasn't asked to offload any assets as \npart of the deal until after Trump took office. \n• What they're saying: \"We respect the judge's decision and look forward to \nthe upcoming trial,\" said Dan Petrocelli, who is leading AT&T and Time Warner's \ndefense in the case, in a statement. \n• At a hearing on Friday, a Justice Department lawyer said that AT&T's \nargument for the documents \"didn't make sense.\" \n• Go deeper: Our report from the courtroom on Friday, when DOJ and AT&T \npresented their arguments. \nFund scoop: Niv Dror, who joined AngelList through its acquisition of Product Hunt \nin 2016, is raising a small early-stage fund focused on consumer products, multiple \nsources tell Axios. Dror declined to comment. \n• The fund will raise at least $1 million, though one source says it could go up to \n$2-3 million. \n• Like Product Hunt colleague Ryan Hoover's own VC fund, Dror's will be \nmanaged on the back-end by AngelList. \nSame old story: Yesterday, I grabbed coffee with Day One Ventures founder Masha \nDrokova, and heard a familiar—and still disappointing—story: While raising her fund, \nshe was told by prospective investors that she should get a male co-founder. \n• She initially considered the suggestion, she told me, before remembering it's \nrooted in sexism. \nSoftbank $$$: Softbank's Vision Fund is in early talks to raise additional funds from \nBahrain's sovereign wealth fund, Mumtalakat, the latter's CEO told Reuters. \n• The Persian Gulf has been a major source of funds for the Vision Fund: Public \nInvestment Fund, Saudi Arabia's main sovereign wealth fund, and Abu Dhabi's \nMubadala, are already investors. \n• And it's not the only one visiting the region's investors—funds focused on tokens \nand cryptocurrencies have also been fundraising in the area, I'm told. \nUnicorn stampede: We're not even two months into 2018 and yet, seven startups \nhave already seen their private valuations cross the $1 billion mark—earning \"unicorn\" \nstatus—according to Pitchbook. Last year: 53. The word \"overvalued\" comes to mind... \n1-:77-3:7A \n1-:77-3:7A \n1-:77-3:7A \nThe BFD \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 021098 \nPhoto: George Rose/Getty Images \nBroadcom has adjusted its takeover offer for Qualcomm to $79 per share, down from \nthe its \"best and final\" bid of $82. The move is a response to Qualcomm's \nannouncement yesterday it would pay $127.50 a share for NXP, up from the $ilo it \nhad offered. \n• Why it's the BFD: Broadcom and Qualcomm's takeover dance has taken a \ndramatic turn for what should have been a boring transaction between two chip \ncompanies. \n• Bottom line: \"Broadcom has long said its acquisition of the San Diego-based \nchipmaker is contingent on Qualcomm buying NXP at the previously agreed price, \nsaving a large amount of cash Broadcom could hypothetically use for its own purposes \nonce the acquisition goes through... Qualcomm raised its NXP bid to secure support \nfrom activist investors who have piled into NXP and demanded a higher sale price.\" — \nBloomberg. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 021099 \nViva!, \nViva!, \nVenture Capital Deals \n• Moovit, an Israeli maker of a transportation app, has raised $50 million in Series D \nfunding led by Intel Capital, with participation from Sequoia, BMW iVentures, NGP, \nSound Ventures, BRM, Gemini, Vaizra, Vintage, and Hanaco. http://axioslink/fQSW \n• Vectra, a San Jose, Calif.-based cybersecurity startup, has raised $36 million in \nSeries D funding led by Atlantic Bridge, with participation from the Ireland \nStrategic Investment Fund, Nissho Electronics Corp., Khosla Ventures, Accel Partners, \nIA Ventures, AME Cloud Ventures, DAG Ventures and Wipro Ventures. www.vectra.ai  \n• FourKites, a Chicago-based make of supply chain management software, has raised \n$35 million in Series B funding.

What\ncould be more encouraging to Iran than the idea that they will be\ngetting into the nuclear business just as we are getting out? Imagine\nIran’s supreme council meeting to discuss whether to continue the\ncostly pursuit of nuclear weapons. “But what is the point of building\nthese weapons?” asks a skeptical mullah. “We will have one or two\nand the Americans have thousands.” Another replies: “Yes, but the\nAmericans have declared their intention to eliminate nuclear weapons\nentirely.

It’s been two years since the Iranian people rose up to protest a\nstolen election with a bravery that stirred the world and presented\nAmericans with a truer image of a young and highly educated nation\nthan the old specter of the bearded Islamic zealot. The Green\nMovement was suppressed through barbaric violence but its example\nhelped kindle the Arab Spring.\n\nAs Hamid Dabashi of Columbia University wrote in July, 2009:\n“Tehran, I believe, is ground zero of a civil rights movement that will\nleave no Muslim or Arab country, or even Israel, untouched.” He\nadded, “The moving pictures of Iranians flooding colorfully into the\nstreets have forever altered the visual vocabulary of the global\nperception of ‘the Middle East.””\n\nSeldom were there more prescient words.\n\nThey were quoted by Nader Hashemi of the University of Denver in a\nrecent talk on Iran, in which he noted shared Iranian and Arab aims:\n“Democracy and dignity, the rule of law and respect for basic human\nrights, political transparency and an end to corruption.”\n\nThat urge is still powerful in Iran beneath the opaque, directionless\napparatus of the Islamic Republic.

To distinguish hostile aircraft, one of the things you need, besides a\nnetwork of computers and early-warning radar sites, is a map of all commercial air\ntraffic, updated in real time. The United States built such a system and named it SAGE\n(Semi-Automatic Ground Environment). SAGE in turn spawned Sabre, the first\nintegrated reservation system for booking airline travel in real time. Sabre and its\nprogeny soon became not just a map as to what seats were available but also a system\nthat began to control, with decentralized intelligence, where airliners would fly, and\nwhen.\n\nBut isn’t there a control room somewhere, with someone at the controls? Maybe\nnot. Say, for example, you build a system to map highway traffic in real time, simply by\ngiving cars access to the map in exchange for reporting their own speed and location at\nthe time. The result is a fully decentralized control system. Nowhere is there any\ncontrolling model of the system except the system itself.\n\nImagine it is the first decade of the 21st century and you want to track the\ncomplexity of human relationships in real time. For social life at a small college, you\ncould construct a central database and keep it up to date, but its upkeep would become\noverwhelming if taken to any larger scale. Better to pass out free copies of a simple\nsemi-autonomous code, hosted locally, and let the social network update itself. This code\nis executed by digital computers, but the analog computing performed by the system as a\nwhole far exceeds the complexity of the underlying code. The resulting pulse-frequency\ncoded model of the social graph becomes the social graph. It spreads wildly across the\ncampus and then the world.\n\nWhat if you wanted to build a machine to capture what everything known to the\nhuman species means? With Moore’s Law behind you, it doesn’t take too long to digitize\nall the information in the world. You scan every book ever printed, collect every email\never written, and gather forty-nine years of video every twenty-four hours, while tracking\nwhere people are and what they do, in real time. But how do you capture the meaning?\n\nEven in the age of all things digital, this cannot be defined in any strictly logical\nsense, because meaning, among humans, isn’t fundamentally logical. The best you can\ndo, once you have collected all possible answers, is to invite well-defined questions and\ncompile a pulse-frequency weighted map of how everything connects. Before you know\nit, your system will not only be observing and mapping the meaning of things, it will start\nconstructing meaning as well. In time, it will control meaning, in the same way as the\ntraffic map starts to control the flow of traffic even though no one seems to be in control.\n\nThere are three laws of artificial intelligence. The first, known as Ashby’s Law, after\ncybernetician W. Ross Ashby, author of Design for a Brain, states that any effective\ncontrol system must be as complex as the system it controls.\n\nThe second law, articulated by John von Neumann, states that the defining\ncharacteristic of a complex system is that it constitutes its own simplest behavioral\ndescription. The simplest complete model of an organism is the organism itself. Trying\nto reduce the system’s behavior to any formal description makes things more\ncomplicated, not less.\n\n39\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_016842\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

Even though the Cold War\nhad been declared over after the collapse of the Soviet Union a quar-\nter of a century earlier, the age-old enterprise of espionage did not\nend with it. Russia and China still sought to blunt the edge that the\nNSA gave the United States. The Snowden breach therefore needs to\nbe considered in the context of the once and future intelligence war.\n\nThe modern enterprise of reading the communications of other\nnations traces back in the United States to military code-breaking\nefforts preceding America’s entry into World War I. The invention\nof the radio at the end of the nineteenth century soon provided the\nmeans of rapidly sending and getting messages from ships, subma-\nrines, ground forces, spies, and embassies. These over-the-air mes-\nsages could also be intercepted from the ether by adversaries. If they\nwere to remain secret, they could not be sent in plain text. They\nhad to be sent in either code, in which letters are substituted for one\nanother, or, more effectively, a cipher, in which numbers are sub-\nstituted for letters. Making and breaking codes and ciphers became\na crucial enterprise for nations. By 1914, the U.S. Army and Navy\n\n® had set up units, staffed by mathematicians, linguists, and crossword ©\npuzzle solvers, to intercept and decode enemy messages. After the\nwar had ended in 1918, these units were fused into a cover corpora-\ntion called the Code Compilation Company, which moved to new\noffices on Thirty-Seventh Street and Madison Avenue in New York\nCity.\n\nUnder the supervision of the famous cryptographer Herbert O.\nYardley, a team of twenty code breakers was employed in what was\ncalled the Black Chamber. Yardley arranged for Western Union,\nwhich had the telegraph monopoly in America, to provide the Black\nChamber with all the telegrams coming into the United States. “Its\nfar-seeking eyes penetrate the secret conference chambers at Wash-\nington, Tokyo, London, Paris, Geneva, Rome,” Yardley wrote about\nthe Black Chamber. “Its sensitive ears catch the faintest whispering\nin the foreign capitals of the world.” But in 1929, at the instructions\nof President Herbert Hoover, Secretary of State Henry Stimson\nclosed the Black Chamber, saying famously, “Gentlemen should not\nread each other’s mail.”\n\nThe moratorium did not last long.

The government responded by opening fire. Within a few months, a peaceful uprising grew into a full-scale civil war, which has lasted for more than two years and is unlikely to end soon.

Congress vetoed this resolution. \n\nThere are many reasons why the US should refrain from providing the opposition with weapons. Over the two years of military confrontation, the situation on the ground has become increasingly chaotic. It is important to understand that there is no united opposition capable of overthrowing / toppling Assad’s regime. Instead, there are different military groups, using terrorist methods against the government forces, as well as against each other. The most prominent of them, the Free Syrian Army, is not strong enough to defeat Assad’s forces. Even if the US provides the FSA with light weapons, this opposition group is outnumbered by hundreds of thousands against Assad’s army. Even according to the most exaggerated estimates, the size of the FSA does not exceed 20,000 soldiers, while Assad’s army counts as many as 400,000, equipped with heavy and sophisticated weapons. \n\nDue to the uprising, different extremist military groups have been able to cross the border and enter Syria. One of the leading armed groups, Al-Nusra Front, an affiliate of the world’s largest terrorist organizations Al-Qaeda, has been included by the US in the international terrorism blacklist. It is important to note that these rebels have many supply channels, making it impossible for the US to control which group will be receiving the weapons, creating the risk of the US arms being used by terrorists against America or its allies in the region. \n\nMoreover, after two years of fighting against the regime, the opposition forces have started to turn guns on each other, fighting for power and territory. This significantly undermines their ability to form a united government, decreasing the probability of a strong alternative force. Providing military groups with weapons will only escalade the violence, lead to more massacre and destruction. \n\nMore importantly, even if the Assad’s regime is overthrown, the opposition is unlikely to succeed in forming a stable and functional democratic government. Admittedly, Bashar Assad has made immense mistakes since the beginning of the war. Human rights have been viciously violated, tens of thousands of people, including civilians, have been killed. But it appears that there is no better alternative at the moment than Assad remaining in power. Once the regime is overthrown, the power vacuum is inevitable. Removing Mr. Assad is just a tiny part of a long and troublesome process. If history is any guide, overthrowing a dictatorship is just the very first step. Ouster of Muammar Quaddafi in Libya was supposed to bring democracy and stability. Instead, the country is more destabilized than ever. Two years after the revolution, a significant part of Libya remains under the control of the militias, the armed groups who did not cease power even after the parliamentary elections and continue to use force against the government. \n\nThe situation is even worse in Iraq, where Al-Qaeda has been expanding its power again. The past four months have been among the bloodiest since 2008, with death toll reaching 3,000. The Al-Qaeda affiliate, The Islamic State of Iraq, started conducting terrorist attacks, not only against the government forces and Shia mosques, but also the civilians, further destabilizing the week government. The Islamic State of Iraq has become one of the most prominent military groups fighting in Syria. The terrorist groups are trying to destabilize and debase Syria, which would give them an opportunity to create there a platform to plan international terrorist attacks. If the opposition forces gain control of the country, this scenario is almost inevitable. Subsequently, the conflict in Syria is dramatically impacting its neighboring countries. More than a million of refugees from Syria have fled to Jordan, Turkey, Lebanon and Iraq. \n\nSome critics, looking at the turmoil in Syria, Egypt, Lybia, claim that the warm Arab spring has turned into a cold winter. Tunisia, for example, the first of the Arab countries to overthrow their dictatorship, is on the edge of another civil war after two political assassinations. It might take years until the situation in Syria stabilizes, decades until the country turns into a genuine and a true democracy. If Americans are to learn from their mistakes in Iraq and Libya, military intervention is off the table. To stop Syria’s turmoil, the United States needs a new strategy aimed at pressuring both sides into negotiating. Syrian conflict cannot be resolved by military methods. The only way to end the war is through political dialogue. Providing the rebels with weapons would only aggravate the situation and lead to more deaths and casualties. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

It's just so easy that the only reason non-vegan culture can possibly persist\nis through a really high degree of not giving a shit. In a way, that's understandable; I don't\nhave much of a connection to animals myself. A lot of my vegan friends love animals and\nwant to be around them all the time; I don't. If a smelly dog never jumps on me again, it\nwill be too soon. But the fact is, animals have senses and feelings. Interacting with any\nanimal for longer than thirty seconds can conclusively show you that animals like and\ndislike things, and that they feel something that looks exactly like pain. Which brings me\nto...\n\n2. If you care about consent, then veganism is transparently the right thing to do. There\nare environmental arguments and stuff, but I mean, seriously, let's call a spade a spade:\nwhen you eat meat, you're eating the murdered body of an animal who died for no reason\nother than your transient pleasure. As for animal products: many things that happen to\nanimals on factory farms are abominable and obscene, as two minutes of Googling or this_\nwebsite or this video can show you.\n\nEven if you decide to eat animal products that come only from well-treated animals,\nthere's no way to be sure that those animals were actually well-treated unless you're\nraising them yourself. As this vegan FAO points out, there's an amazing amount of\nanimal suffering that still occurs on \"humane\" farms. (Sa/on has written about it, too.)\nSome of those farms are doubtless fairly pleasant for the animals, but others.... Well, let's\njust say that calling some \"humane\" farms more merciful than factory farms is like saying\nthat being burned alive is preferable to dying in a medieval torture device.\n\nPersonally, when I went vegan, a lot of the reason it felt easy was because I no longer had\nto spend tons of mental energy suppressing my empathy. I was amazed at how relieved I\nfelt. Again, I'm not pretending to be perfect about it -- I eat non-vegan food sometimes in\nsocial situations, sometimes when it's about to be thrown away, and sometimes just when\nI'm drunk. If you need to make accommodations in order to feel comfortable being\nvegan, then I'm the last person who will criticize you. I'll just be glad you're taking steps\ntowards being vegan.\n\nIt took me a long time to decide to go vegan, and I understand that it might take you a\nlong time, too. I've listed a lot of resources in this post and I hope you'll consider looking\nat them. Questions are welcome in the comments, although I may not be able to answer\nthem. I wish you luck. And if you're already vegan, then congratulations and high-5!\n\nNow for recipes!\n\nI promise that these recipes are beloved by non-vegans as well as vegans. In fact, even\n\nwhen I wasn't vegan, they were some of my favorites. When I feed these dishes to non-\nvegans, they are frequently startled that the food isn't vegan. (Sometimes I save the Big\nReveal for last. Heh, heh.)\n\n(One of my other favorite gentle pro-vegan tactics is to walk into restaurants and ask if\nthey have anything vegan on the menu. When the answer is no, I smile and thank them\nand leave.)\n\nOrganic and fair-trade ingredients are obviously encouraged. I'm not as good about\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_018598\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

Repeal,\nin Bannon’s view, was the pledge, and repeal would be the most satisfying, even cathartic,\nresult. It would also be the easiest one to achieve, since virtually every Republican was\nalready publicly committed to voting for repeal. But Bannon, seeing health care as a weak\nlink in Bannonism-Trumpism’s appeal to the workingman, was careful to take a back seat\nin the debate. Later, he hardly even made an effort to rationalize how he’d washed his\nhands of the mess, saying just, “I hung back on health care because it’s not my thing.”\n\nIt was Ryan who, with “repeal and replace,” obfuscated the issue and won over Trump.\nRepeal would satisfy the Republican bottom line, while replace would satisfy the\notherwise off-the-cuff pledges that Trump had made on his own. (Pay no attention to the\nlikelihood that what the president construed as repeal and replace might be very different\nfrom what Ryan construed as repeal and replace.) “Repeal and replace” was a useful\nslogan, too, in that it came to have meaning without having any actual or specific\nmeaning.\n\nThe week after the election, Ryan, bringing Tom Price—the Georgia congressman and\northopedist who had become Ryan’s resident heath care expert—traveled to Trump’s\nBedminster, New Jersey, estate for a repeal and replace briefing. The two men summed up\nfor Trump—who kept wandering off topic and trying to turn the conversation to golf—\nseven years of Republican legislative thinking about Obamacare and the Republican\nalternatives. Here was a perfect example of an essential Trump paradigm: he acceded to\nanyone who seemed to know more about any issue he didn’t care about, or simply one\nwhose details he couldn’t bring himself to focus on closely. Great! he would say,\npunctuating every statement with a similar exclamation and regularly making an effort to\njump from his chair. On the spot, Trump eagerly agreed to let Ryan run the health care bill\nand to make Price the Health and Human Services secretary.\n\nKushner, largely staying silent during the health care debate, publicly seemed to accept\nthe fact that a Republican administration had to address Obamacare, but he privately\nsuggested that he was personally against both repeal alone and repeal and replace.

(What’s more, Kushner’s brother Josh ran a health insurance\ncompany that depended on Obamacare.)\n\nNot for the last time, then, the White House would be divided along the political\nspectrum, Bannon taking an absolutist base position, Priebus aligned with Ryan in support\nof the Republican leadership, and Kushner maintaining, and seeing no contradiction in, a\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_020007\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

The Internet provided the SVR with just this\nopportunity. As you will recall, holes in the security of the com-\nputer networks of the U.S. Office of Personnel Management and\nUSIS and the websites of the companies supplying the NSA with\nindependent contractors had made the background checks on Ameri-\ncan intelligence workers available to the Chinese, and presumably\nother adversary intelligence service hackers, since 2011. If the SVR\nhad access to this personnel data, the research for a candidate would\nbe greatly facilitated. From the 127-page Standard Form 86, which\neach applicant for a security clearance submits, the SVR could filter\nout intelligence workers employed by the NSA by their educational\nbackground, employment history, affiliations, and foreign contacts.\nIt could then search this data for candidates with a possible hacktiv-\nist profile.\n\nThis data could next be crossed with a list of individuals the SVR\nknew were in contact with high-profile activists who were part of the\nanti-surveillance movements. This would include core participants\nin the Tor Project, WikiLeaks, Noisebridge, CryptoParties, the Free-\n\n© dom of the Press Foundation, and the Electronic Frontier Founda- ©\ntion. (Snowden, for example, had been in touch with members of all\nthese groups in 2012 and 2013.)\n\nThe SVR would have little problem monitoring even encrypted\ncommunications with leading figures in the anti-surveillance world.\nThese activists, despite secrecy rituals such as putting their cell\nphones in refrigerators, remain visible to a sophisticated intelligence\nservice such as the SVR. All the defensive tactics of Laura Poitras,\nincluding PGP encryption, Tor software, and air-gapped computers\n(computers that have never been connected to the Internet), did not\nkeep secrets about her sources entirely to herself.

It was an Army Reserve program created in 2003 that allowed individuals who had not\nserved in the military or completed their education, to train to be a Special Forces recruit. He\nlisted his religion on the application as “Buddhist” because, as he explained in a sardonic post on\nArs Technica, “Agnostic is strangely absent” from the form.”\n\nHe enlisted in the army reserves on May 7, 2004, according to U.S. Army records. He\nreported for a 10 week basic training at Fort Benning, Georgia. That was standard course for all\nenlistees in the infantry. In August, he began a three-week course in of parachute jumping but did\nnot complete that training. US Army records show he did not complete the training requirements\nand received no commendations. As Snowden put it in his Internet postings, he “washed out.”\nHe was discharged on September 29, 2004, ending his 19 week military career. Snowden would\nlater claim on the Internet that he returned to civilian life because he had injured himself by\nbreaking both legs. An Army spokesman said, however, that he could not confirm that Snowden\ninjured his legs or that he was in fact dropped from the program for medical reasons. Under his\nalias TheTrueHooHa he wrote that “they [the Army] held on to me until the doctors cleared me\nto be discharged, and then after being cleared they held onto me for another month just for shits\nand giggles.” He attributed this treatment in the Army, as he would later attribute his problems in\nthe CIA and NSA, to the inferior intelligence of his superiors, He wrote in his post “Psych\nproblems = dishonorable discharge depending on how much they hate you. Lots of alleged homos\nwere in the hold unit, too, but they only got a general discharge at best.” It is not entirely clear\nwhether or not Snowden actually injured himself. If he had broken his legs, it was not evident to\nJoyce Kinsey, his next door neighbor, who told me that she never saw Snowden on crutches when\nhe returned to his mother’s condominium in September 2004. Whether or not he broke his legs,\nArmy records show that he did not receive a medical discharge. He received an “administrative\ndischarge.” Unlike a medical discharge which is given because a soldier has sustained injuries\nthat prevent him from performing his duties, an administrative discharge is a “morally-neutral”\nform of separation given to a soldier when her or she is deemed for non-medical reasons\ninappropriate for military service. Snowden himself preferred to voice a medical explanation for\nhis severance, just as he had claimed a medical reason for dropping out of high school (and would\nlater claim he needed medical treatment for epilepsy at the NSA.)\n\nWhen he returned home from Fort Benning, Georgia on September 28, 2004, he was 21.\nHaving failed in his attempt to join the Special Forces, he returned to his mother’s condominium\nin Elliott City, where he remained unemployed for several months. He took a job as a security\nguard at the University of Maryland’s Center for Advanced Study of Language. According to his\nArs Technica postings, he worked the night shift from six in the evening to six in the morning.\nBecause intelligence officers took its language courses, Snowden had to take a polygraph exam to\nget the job. After he passed it, he was hired and given his first security clearance But he had\nhigher ambitions than being a campus security guard, It was only a temporary stop gap for him.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_020198\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

Only a fraction\n(but not a Vanishing fraction) of the world’s accumulated wisdom and design and\nrepartee and silliness has made it onto the Internet, but probably a better tactic for the\njudge to adopt when confronting a candidate in the Turing Test is not to search for such\nitems but to create them anew. AI in its current manifestations is parasitic on human\nintelligence. It quite indiscriminately gorges on whatever has been produced by human\ncreators and extracts the patterns to be found there—including some of our most\npernicious habits.'! These machines do not (yet) have the goals or strategies or capacities\nfor self-criticism and innovation to permit them to transcend their databases by\nreflectively thinking about their own thinking and their own goals. They are, as Wiener\nsays, helpless, not in the sense of being shackled agents or disabled agents but in the\nsense of not being agents at all—not having the capacity to be “moved by reasons” (as\nKant put it) presented to them. It is important that we keep it that way, which will take\nsome doing.\n\nOne of the flaws in Weizenbaum’s book Computer Power and Human Reason,\nsomething I tried in vain to convince him of in many hours of discussion, is that he could\nnever decide which of two theses he wanted to defend: AJ is impossible! or Al is possible\nbut evil! He wanted to argue, with John Searle and Roger Penrose, that “Strong AI” is\nimpossible, but there are no good arguments for that conclusion. After all, everything we\nnow know suggests that, as I have put it, we are robots made of robots made of robots. . .\ndown to the motor proteins and their ilk, with no magical ingredients thrown in along the\nway. Weizenbaum’s more important and defensible message was that we should not\nstrive to create Strong AI and should be extremely cautious about the AI systems that we\ncan create and have already created. As one might expect, the defensible thesis is a\nhybrid: A/ (Strong AJ) is possible in principle but not desirable. The AI that’s practically\npossible is not necessarily evil—unless it is mistaken for Strong AI!\n\nThe gap between today’s systems and the science-fictional systems dominating\nthe popular imagination is still huge, though many folks, both lay and expert, manage to\nunderestimate it. Let’s consider IBM’s Watson, which can stand as a worthy landmark\nfor our imaginations for the time being. It is the result of a very large-scale R&D process\nextending over many person-centuries of intelligent design, and as George Church notes\nin these pages, it uses thousands of times more energy than a human brain (a\ntechnological limitation that, as he also notes, may be temporary). Its victory in\nJeopardy! was a genuine triumph, made possible by the formulaic restrictions of the\nJeopardy! rules, but in order for it to compete, even these rules had to be revised (one of\n\n10 Tn Darwin’s Dangerous Idea, 1995, p. 109, I coined the capitalized version, Vast, meaning Very much\nmore than ASTronomical, and its complement, Vanishing, to replace the usual exaggerations infinite and\ninfinitesimal for discussions of those possibilities that are not officially infinite but nevertheless infinite for\nall practical purposes.\n\n1 Aylin Caliskan-Islam, Joanna J.

When evaluating the pervasiveness of wrongdoing\nwithin the corporation, prosecutors are advised that while it may be\nappropriate to charge a corporation for minor misconduct where the\nwrongdoing was pervasive, “it may not be appropriate to impose liability\nupon a corporation, particularly one with a robust compliance program in\nplace, under a strict respondeat superior theory for the single isolated act\nof a rogue employee.” /d. § 9-28.500.A (emphasis added), Prosecutors\nshould also consider a company’s compliance program when examining\nany remedial actions taken, including efforts to implement an effective\ncompliance program or to improve an existing one. As the commentary\nexplains, “although the inadequacy ofa corporate compliance program is\na factor to consider when deciding whether to charge a corporation, that\ncorporation’s quick recognition of the flaws in the program and its efforts\nto improve the program are also factors to consider as to appropriate\ndisposition ofa case.” Id. § 9-28.900.B.

EE\n\nJeffrey Epstein, the Florida money manager who once roamed in the same social circle as Bill Clinton, Prince\nAndrew and other high profile figures, is going to be released from prison early, a source tells\nRadarOnline.com.\n\nEpstein pleaded guilty last year to procuring teen girls for prostitution, ending his lifestyle with the rich and\nfamous in a Palm Beach, Florida scandal that reverberated through high-profile society. He received an 18-\nmonth sentence and was slated to be incarcerated until the end of this year.\n\nBut now, says the source, the jail door is about to swing open because Epstein has been secretly helping the feds\nunravel a suspected Ponzi scheme. He had inside knowledge of the scheme because he was one of its victims,\n\nlosing $67 million.\n\nThe source says it’s all tied to the indictment of former managers of Bear Stearns Mortgage Investment Fund, and\nin that case Epstein is the person who is identified only as Victim # 1.\n\nMeanwhile, Epstein’s life behind bars hasn’t been too rough — in fact he’s allowed to spend most days at his\nattorney’s office. He was supposedly working on a charity venture but the source says he was actually busy\nhelping the feds with the Ponzi scheme. One source says that he’s been guarded by men in suits with\nearphones.\n\nWell if those suits are going to follow him when he’s freed they better pack bathing suits.

Thus, the government must prove that Mr. Epstein has the specific intent to target a known\nminor to engage in prohibited sexual activity at the time of the call. We have seen zero evidence of\nthis. To the extent Mr. Epstein /ater may have persuaded a particular individual to engage in\nunlawful sexual activity during a massage, such persuasion occurred face to face, and can not work\nretroactively to render the earlier phone call an offense under the statute.\n\nAs to the: purported violation of 18 U.S.C. § 2423 for allegedly traveling in interstate\ncommerce for the purpose of engaging in illicit sexual activity, CEOS does not deny that Mr. Epstein\nwas returning to one of his residences when he traveled to Florida.* CEOS explicitly stated it “fully\nunderstand[s] our argument” (CEOS letter at p.2) that Mr. Epstein should not be charged under\n§ 2423(b) because the dominant purpose for his traveling to Palm Beach was not to engage in illegal\nsexual activity, but to simply return to one of his residences. Rather, this is apparently another\n“compelling” point of law which may be left to “a court to decide whether the law properly reaches\nsuch conduct.” (CEOS letter at p. 2).° Notably, implicit in this concession by CEOS is that the law -\nhas never before been so applied, that is, there is no precedent for a court to extend the statute as the\nUSAO seeks to do here. In fact, the United States Supreme Court prohibited the criminalization of\ntravel under identical circumstances over a half century ago. See, Mortenson v. United States, 322\nUS. 369, 374 (1944) (intention to engage in proscribed conduct must “exist before the conclusion of\nthe interstate journey and must be the dominate motive of such interstate movement.” (Emphasis\nadded.)\n\nBeyond an absence of proof regarding the travel element in connection with 18 U.S.C. §2423,\nthe requisite age requirement for a violation of that statute is important. 18 U.S.C. §2423, by\nreference to Chapter 109A (18 U.S.C. §2423(f)(1)), specifically defines a minor for purposes of that\nstatute as an individual who has not attained the age of 16. If an alleged victim is 16 years of age or\nolder, a violation of this statute pursuant to 2423(f)(1) can only occur if it can be proven that force,\nthreat or drugs were involved. See, 18 U.S.C. §§ 2241 et seg. There are no such allegations here. As\na result, in order to find a violation under 18 U.S.C. § 2423, the United States would have to prove\nthat Mr. Epstein engaged in one of the sexual acts defined at 18 U.S.C. § 2246(2) with an individual\nunder the age of 16, and that he formed the intent and dominant purpose to do so prior to the time he\nmade a return trip to Florida. Again, there is no such evidence here. [IMM has specifically\ntestified that 1) she never engaged in sexual activity with Mr. Epstein; 2) she never even met or\ntalked to Mr. Epstein prior to her arrival at his house; and 3) she lied about her age not only to Mr.\nEpstein, but, in fact, to the world on her MySpace page when she said that she was 18 years old. Itis,\nthen, also worth noting in this regard that 18 U.S.C. §§2243(c) provides an affirmative defense if\nproven by a preponderance of the evidence if Mr. Epstein reasonably believed that EEE was\n\n4 In addition to his residence there, Mr. Epstein also has several businesses, and personal matters and contacts to which\nhe attends in Florida. For example, beginning in 2002, Mr. Epstein visited his mother nearly every weekend in Palm\nBeach until she passed away in April, 2004.\n\n5 As previously set forth herein, and as more fully explained in other submissions related to this case, the recent\nSupreme Court decisions in Santos and Cuellar make this attempted stretch of the law improper.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_012194\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

We were surprised at the market’s unbridled\noptimism in April 1 , since the tug-of-war between private sector profits and public sector problems has a long way to go. We\nchose the charts on the front page of our 2011 Outlook carefully; they were designed to show that equity markets were priced\ninexpensively, but were likely to stay that way, given too much stimulus in the East, and ineffective stimulus in the West 2 . We\nexpect a modest second half recovery, based primarily on US capital spending increases, easy credit conditions everywhere, and\na pick-up in industrial production in Japan. But the world’s structural problems are weighing on the private sector, and our\nportfolios are positioned for a single-digit year in credit, equities and hedge funds.\nSomething different this week. I was on the road seeing clients last week, and was asked “what should be done about job\ngrowth”. We are investors and not politicians, so my ideas 3 are not relevant. However, it seems to me that anyone involved in\nthe jobs debate should be required to read the article below, written after the prior deep US recession (1990-1991). It’s\nfrom George McGovern, one of the most liberal politicians 4 ever to hold office and run for President. His epiphanies after\nleaving office and running the Stratford Inn are worth considering as legislators contemplate additional job creation measures,\nand the broader regulatory environment in which the private sector operates.\n“A Politician's Dream Is a Businessman's Nightmare”, by George McGovern 5 , June 1992\nWisdom too often never comes, and so one ought not to reject it merely because it comes late. (Justice Felix\nFrankfurter). It's been 11 years since I left the U.S. Senate, after serving 24 years in high public office. After\nleaving a career in politics, I devoted much of my time to public lectures that took me into every state in the\nunion and much of Europe, Asia, the Middle East and Latin America.\nIn 1988, I invested most of the earnings from this lecture circuit acquiring the leasehold on Connecticut's\nStratford Inn. Hotels, inns and restaurants have always held a special fascination for me. The Stratford Inn\npromised the realization of a longtime dream to own a combination hotel, restaurant and public conference\nfacility--complete with an experienced manager and staff. In retrospect, I wish I had known more about the\nhazards and difficulties of such a business, especially during a recession of the kind that hit New England just as\nI was acquiring the inn's 43-year leasehold. I also wish that during the years I was in public office, I had had\nthis firsthand experience about the difficulties business people face every day. That knowledge would have\nmade me a better U.S. senator and a more understanding presidential contender.\nToday we are much closer to a general acknowledgment that government must encourage business to expand and\ngrow. Bill Clinton, Paul Tsongas, Bob Kerrey and others have, I believe, changed the debate of our party 6 .\nWe intuitively know that to create job opportunities we need entrepreneurs who will risk their capital\nagainst an expected payoff. Too often, however, public policy does not consider whether we are choking\noff those opportunities.\n1 The Osama Bin Laden episode marked the equity market peak for the year. Some commentators saw this event as a basis for\nfurther optimism, but unsurprisingly, the positive glow lasted for only around 2.5 hours the subsequent Monday. According to the\nCongressional Research Service, over the last decade, the US has spent at least $1.1 trillion in war funding operations,\nsurpassing the constant-dollar cost of the Korean and Vietnam Wars combined. This highlights the disproportionately large\npain that small, non-sovereign entities can inflict in the modern era.\n2 So far, the large growth and employment multipliers from deficit spending estimated by Christina Romer (former Chair of the\nPresident’s Council of Economic Advisers) have not materialized. John Taylor and John Cogan from Stanford have been closer to\nthe mark: an initial boost, but then a rapidly fading benefit.\n3 I like the idea of extending the holding period for short term capital gains to 3-5 years, and cutting the long term capital\ngains rate closer to 5%-10%. It could encourage more business formation, since more of what people create, they keep. If the\ncutoff year is properly set, it could be done on a deficit–neutral basis.\n4 According to methodology described by Keith Poole of the University of San Diego in the American Journal of Political Science,\nMcGovern ranks as the 99 th most liberal politician out of 3,320 politicians serving from 1937 to 2002.\n5 In a letter to the Wall Street Journal. Reprinted with permission; emphasis added.\n6 This may not have been a permanent change. The National Taxpayers Union rated the Blue Dog Democrats as having a fiscal\nconservatism score of 52% in 1995; by 2009, it had fallen to 18%.\n1\nJune 14, 2011\nTopics: On lessons learned running the Stratford Inn\nMy own business perspective has been limited to that small hotel and restaurant in Stratford, Conn., with an\nespecially difficult lease and a severe recession. But my business associates and I also lived with federal, state\nand local rules that were all passed with the objective of helping employees, protecting the environment, raising\ntax dollars for schools, protecting our customers from fire hazards, etc. While I never doubted the worthiness of\nany of these goals, the concept that most often eludes legislators is: `Can we make consumers pay the higher\nprices for the increased operating costs that accompany public regulation and government reporting requirements\nwith reams of red tape.' It is a simple concern that is nonetheless often ignored by legislators 7 . For example,\nthe papers today are filled with stories about businesses dropping health coverage for employees. We provided a\nsubstantial package for our staff at the Stratford Inn. However, were we operating today, those costs would\nexceed $150,000 a year for health care on top of salaries and other benefits. There would have been no\nreasonable way for us to absorb or pass on these costs.\nSome of the escalation in the cost of health care is attributed to patients suing doctors. While one cannot assess\nthe merit of all these claims, I've also witnessed firsthand the explosion in blame-shifting and scapegoating for\nevery negative experience in life. Today, despite bankruptcy, we are still dealing with litigation from\nindividuals who fell in or near our restaurant. Despite these injuries, not every misstep is the fault of someone\nelse. Not every such incident should be viewed as a lawsuit instead of an unfortunate accident. And while the\nbusiness owner may prevail in the end, the endless exposure to frivolous claims and high legal fees is\nfrightening.\nOur Connecticut hotel, along with many others, went bankrupt for a variety of reasons, the general economy in\nthe Northeast being a significant cause. But that reason masks the variety of other challenges we faced that drive\noperating costs and financing charges beyond what a small business can handle. It is clear that some businesses\nhave products that can be priced at almost any level. The price of raw materials (e.g., steel and glass) and lifesaving\ndrugs and medical care are not easily substituted by consumers. It is only competition or antitrust that\ntempers price increases. Consumers may delay purchases, but they have little choice when faced with higher\nprices. In services, however, consumers do have a choice when faced with higher prices. You may have to stay\nin a hotel while on vacation, but you can stay fewer days. You can eat in restaurants fewer times per month, or\nforgo a number of services from car washes to shoeshines. Every such decision eventually results in job losses\nfor someone. And often these are the people without the skills to help themselves--the people I've spent a\nlifetime trying to help.\n7 Would McGovern’s focus on red tape make sense today? According to surveys conducted by the National Federation of Small\nBusiness, the answer would be yes. The 3 issues most frequently mentioned as each respondent’s “single most important problem”\nare Poor Sales, Regulation & Red Tape, and Taxes. Two things of note. First, Regulation & Red Tape concerns have been steadily\nrising over the last two years. Secondly, availability of credit does not show up as an issue. As the NFIB wrote in May 2011, “92\npercent reported that all their credit needs were met or that they were not interested in borrowing. Eight percent reported that not all\nof their credit needs were satisfied. Three percent reported financing as their #1 business problem, so credit supply is not a problem\nfor the overwhelming majority.”\nWhat's the largest problem facing small business?\nPercent of respondents\n35%\n30%\nTaxes\nPoor sales\n25%\n20%\n15%\n10%\n5%\nRegulation & Red Tape\n1986 1988 1990 1992 1994 1996 1998 2000 2002 2004 2006 2008 2010\nSource: National Federation of Independent Business.\n2\nJune 14, 2011\nTopics: On lessons learned running the Stratford Inn\nIn short, “one-size-fits-all” rules for business ignore the reality of the market place. And setting thresholds for\nregulatory guidelines at artificial levels--e.g., 50 employees or more, $500,000 in sales--takes no account of other\nrealities, such as profit margins, labor intensive vs. capital intensive businesses, and local market economics.\nThe problem we face as legislators is: Where do we set the bar so that it is not too high to clear? I don't have\nthe answer. I do know that we need to start raising these questions more often.\nSo, there you have it, one of the more remarkable epiphanies in American politics: a paean to entrepreneurship and\ngovernment restraint from one of its most progressive members. Public epiphanies like this are rare, but there have been\nothers. Last year, Al Gore conceded that first-generation ethanol was “not good policy” given its low energy conversion ratios,\nand said he had supported ethanol out of “a certain fondness for the farmers in the state of Iowa because I was about to run for\npresident.\" 8 In 2008, former Fed Chair Greenspan conceded that his Ayn Rand philosophies regarding regulations and\nshareholder self-interest were flawed. Perhaps the most famous epiphany was from Robert McNamara, Secretary of Defense\nand one of the principal architects of the Vietnam War. In 1995, he conceded that he was “wrong, terribly wrong” about the\nwar. George McGovern was one of the war’s fiercest opponents, saying on the floor of the Senate, “I'm tired of old men\ndreaming up wars for young men to fight”.\nThere may be no magic elixir of policies to speed the adjustment the US faces. Look at it this way: the US is trying the megastimulus\nroute, while the UK has accelerated its fiscal austerity program. Yet both countries are struggling with below-trend\ngrowth and employment. Perhaps after a debt binge, there are no easy answers, other than time. What to do next? McGovern’s\narticle suggests that an overly interventionist public sector may be the wrong answer, given the unintended consequences.\nUS and UK still searching for answers\nTotal household , non-financial corporate, federal and municipal debt,\npercent of GDP\n300%\n280%\n260%\n240%\n220%\n200%\n180%\n160%\n140%\n1987 1990 1993 1996 1999 2002 2005 2008\nSource: Federal Reserve, Office for National Statistics.

At one end of the corridor was a set of shelves where we collected a\nclean set of underwear, pants and socks each week. At the other end were the\ntoilets — at that point, the only indoor toilets on the kibbutz, with real toilet-\nseats, rather than just holes in the ground. All of us showered together until the\nage of twelve. I can’t think of a single one of us who went on to marry someone\nfrom our own age-group in the kibbutz. It would have seemed almost\nincestuous.\n\nMishmar Hasharon and other kibbutzim have long since abandoned the\npractice of collective child-rearing. Some in my generation look back on the\nway we were raised not only with regret, but pain: a sense of parental absence,\nabandonment or neglect. My own memories, and those of most of the children I\ngrew up with, are more positive. The irony is that we probably spent more\nwaking time with our parents than town or city children whose mothers and\nfathers worked nine-to-five jobs. The difference came at bedtime, or during the\nnight. If you woke up unsettled, or ill, the only immediate prospect of comfort\nwas from the metapeled, or another of the kibbutz grown-ups who might be on\novernight duty. Still, my childhood memories are overwhelmingly of feeling\nhappy, safe, protected. I do remember waking up once, late on a stormy winter\nnight when I was nine, in the grips of a terrible fever.

Mubarak for example had about 400,000 people at his disposal working in various security agencies in order to preemptively predict events such as those that took place at Tahrir Square. And he did not foresee the uprising. So who can?\n\n  The 2nd lesson: When friends, and even the leaders among us, say: \"Don't get swept into a panic – if something really grave happens (Iran for example) – the US will not stand by. The world will take action!\"\n\n  And I say: Don't bet on it. Look at Syria. Assad has massacred 200,000 of his own people – with tanks, artillery, fighter jets, even chemical weapons – and the world did not lift a finger.\n\n  And the one insight: To all our opponents and even friends who tell us that our lack of success in reaching an agreement with the Palestinians is the root of all the troubles in the Middle East – the original sin! – I say: this is not true!\n  Even if I, in 2000 (or Rabin and Peres in 1994 or Olmert in 2008), were to have reached a peace treaty with the Palestinians – which would have been implemented a long time ago the \"Muslim Brotherhood\" would still have taken control over Egypt and Al-Sisi would still have taken it back a short time after.\n\n     •\tSyria would still have been embroiled in a bitter civil war. And Iran – would still be striving for regional hegemony and nuclear military capability.\n     •\tThe reasons for all the above are deeply rooted in the history of the nations and the region – and do not stem from the Israeli Palestinian conflict (they may be related to it in another way, which I will get to later on).\n\n     •\tIn the new reality forged by the \"Arab Spring,\" there is good news and bad news for us.\nLet's start with the bad news:\n  ISIS, the disintegration of Syria, the events in Iraq – all of these are bad news that prove to us, time and time again, that the Middle East is indeed a tough neighborhood. There is no mercy for the weak, and there will be no second opportunity for those who don't defend themselves. Every year, new threats arise. And the old ones: Hezbollah, Iran, terrorism –are all \"alive and kicking\" and growing even stronger.\n\n  But there is good news too. Israel is the strongest country in the region, from Tripoli in Libya to Tehran. It's the strongest militarily, strategically, and economically, and if we know act wisely–diplomatically too. Equally important: Israel will continue to be the strongest country in the region in the foreseeable future – especially if we manage to identify and cultivate these sources of empowerment and advantage – including:\n\n     •\t Armed Forces capable of defeating any outside combination of threats, including terrorism.\n     •\tA strong and growing economy in an open relationship with global markets.\n     •\tForeign policy that assures international backing, especially American – diplomatic and economic- backing  Israel's positions, and which holds the \"moral high ground\" vis-a-vis our enemies and opponents.\n\n     •\tThe fact that Israel is stronger than any combination of enemies is what enables us to act from a position of strength and self confidence in order to change the reality : to counter the threats and to seize the opportunities.\n\n     •\tLet me elaborate briefly about each of the threats:\nTwo ironies and one insight about Isis.\n  Assad slaughtered 200,000 of his people including by using chemical weapons – and that wasn't enough to get the British parliament and Prime Minister Cameron or the American Congress and President Obama to act.\n     •\tThen, ISIS beheaded two journalists (not really a new practice in the Middle East) in front of the cameras – and within 48 hours the world was united against them. Better late than never, so we have little reason to complain about the result. However, there is something to learn about the superficiality of the decision-making processes in our world.\n  Second: let's assume for a moment that ISIS is restrained in about a year (and hopefully – crushed) – who wins?\n     •\tThe main winner is Assad, since the Coalition would have wiped out his main adversary, freeing him to focus more intensely on the rest of the rebels – meaning the \"moderate\" rebels, which the Coalition purports to train and reinforce in order to take him down.\n  Iran also wins and of course Hezbollah -  all members of President Bush's Axis of Evil. In other words: the Coalition is doing some of the \"dirty work\" for them.\n\n     •\tIn my best assessment, the Turks are right in their position that there is no point in striking ISIS unless you also set a goal to take down Assad, and act to achieve it. \nThe Turks are right in their call for a \"humanitarian strip\" – 25-30 km into Syrian territory along the borders, and declare it a “no fly zone”, a place for refugees (there are several million of them) to assemble and where they can receive humanitarian aid.\n\n     •\tWhat hasn't been said explicitly is that such a deployment might lead sooner or later to engagement with the Syrian Air Force – followed by the Syrian Air Defense – which could develop into an opportunity to fundamentally change the balance of power and the course of the war against Assad's regime.\n  \nAnd one insight: ISIS may not be as strong as it is being portrayed. A coherent ,intense, coordinated action during the next year or two, particularly if performed according to the Turkish outline and with massive Turkish involvement – could well put the Genie back into the bottle. However – let us make no mistake – ISIS is part of the radical Islamic web of terrorism. A web that is loosely knit, yet survives on strictly restricted resources – and demonstrates operational flexibility, survivability and a fanatic adherence to the goal.\n     •\tWe're talking about ALQ, Jabhat al-Nusra in Syria, Lashkar-e-Taiba in India, the Houthis in Yemen, the Shabab in Sumali, Boko Haram in Nigeria and many more – all across the Muslim strip, from Marrakesh to Bangladesh.\n     •\tAnd this web is very resilient. Dealing with it will take war lasting for a generation, not just a few years. The struggle will require collaboration not just between the moderate Arab nations and Turkey – but a long-standing collaboration between the US, Russia, China, India and Europe – all are are potential targets and victims of this terror everyone to some extent. Forging this collaboration is categorically more important than the events in Ukraine or the North Chinese Sea Islands.\n\n     •\tHezbollah is busy in Syria – and would generally prefer to avoid provoking Israel. Some here would say that Nasrallah has been deterred, that the memory of 2006 is still fresh in his mind and he will not act. I have my reservations about the deterministic nature of this statement. \"Deterrence\" is a somewhat elusive term. This is not a \"zero sum game\" on a one-dimensional bar. This is a complex and context-related issue. Although under normal circumstances, each side has a fundamental position (let's assume for a moment that Hezbollah's position is \"avoid provoking Israel\") – it is still not hard to imagine an event, or damage to Hezbollah's (or Nasrallah's) assets or prestige, that could lead it , despite its basic position, to take action contrary to its true fundamental position. \n     •\tIncidentally, this doesn't apply solely to \"Hezbollah\" – but to us too.\n     •\t Therefore, the working assumptions and the operational deployment must include the possibility of deterioration into a wide-scale confrontation with Hezbollah.\n\n     •\tAnd now, to Iran – which under certain circumstances might be the element that ignites or incites \"Hezbollah\" into action.\n     •\tLet us be clear – a nuclear Iran is a central threat to the entire world order, not just Israel. A nuclear Iran means the end of the non-proliferation  regime– Saudi Arabia, within months, Turkey within a few years and Egypt might follow as well–and all will become nuclear.\n     •\tEvery third-grade dictator will be able to ensure his survivability against the outside world by following in the footsteps of Pakistan, North Korea and Iran.\n     •\tThe \"countdown\" towards the troubling vision of Prof. Graham Allison of Harvard about nuclear weapons in the hands of terrorists – this countdown, even if it takes 15 years, will start. Therefore, blocking Iran from becoming a \"threshold nuclear state\" is crucial, and justifies every effort.\n\n     •\tRight now diplomacy is in hiatus at least until March 2015. It's hard to imagine a good agreement with the P5+1, and a bad agreement would be best left unsigned. The problem is that the Iranians have no real incentive to reach a “final agreement” that would keep them from becoming a nuclear power.\n     •\tAs far as they're concerned, at any given time an improved \"interim agreement\" would be better (unless the P5+1 yield to a bad agreement.)\n\n     •\tThe Iranians are very sophisticated. In their opinion (I emphasize: in their opinion), the American government has changed its goal without admitting it, from \"Iran will not have military nuclear capability. Period.\" to \"Iran will not have military nuclear capability on  our watch \"\n     •\n     \t•\tThis is of course a completely different thing. And this perception only reinforces  Iran's obduracy and the delaying tactics that they've adopted.\n     •\tIsrael has a supreme interest in \"keeping all the options on the table\". However, today, mostly against the backdrop of the drawn-out talks – Israel has an interest in maximizing its understanding with the United States and trying to convince it of the need for determination and perseverance; for \"sticks\" as well as \"carrots\"; and of the importance of completely losing any illusions regarding  the objectives of the Ayatollahs' regime.\n\n     •\tAnd from here, a sharp segue to the diplomatic challenges Israel faces, from the minor (for now) to the major.\n     •\tIsrael is far from being a leaf in the wind. But the world has no geopolitical center of gravity – not the US, Russia, Europe or China –Israel isn't omnipotent either.\n     •\tIt is wrong to disregard what's happening in Europe. It will not be resolved by saying that Europe is ridden with anti-Semitism (though there's quite a bit of truth to that).\n     •\tRegarding BDS, I used to tell the members of the Cabinet that– as long as these voices are coming from Eritrea or Mauritania, we can live with it for years. When it comes from Scandinavia and Britain – it's a different story, and must be taken seriously.\n     •\tRight now it is being espoused by parliaments, not governments. But it could expand – to trade unions, to the academia, to consumer organizations and NGOs. And then, heaven forbid, eventually to governments – which will say \"we are of the people \".  We mustn't forget that Europe is Israel's No. 1 trading partner - not the US and not China. And Europe, with North America and a few countries in the East, is at the heart of the \"reference group\" of liberal democratic countries to which we want to belong, and rightfully so.\n\n     •\tThis leads us to the US – and there, the diplomatic challenge is far greater. Israel is a sovereign state. On more than one occasion, I told President Obama, and before that Presidents Bush and Clinton, the following: \"On issues that we believe are essential to the security and future of Israel and of the Jewish people, Israel will make its decisions alone and on its own responsibility and act upon them. We cannot, and will not want to\", I added, \"delegate the responsibility for such decisions,  when required, even to the best of our friends – which is you.\"\nThe US presidents, I note, did not always like this statement – but they respected it.\n     •\tIn the same token, I told members of the cabinet more than once – \"we must always remember that the US is also a sovereign state. And it expects us to respect its right to form its positions on the issues crucial to it, based on its own interests \". And we have to respect that.\n\n     •\tWithout derogating from our responsibility to make and execute sovereign decisions – the reality is that there isn't full symmetry here.\n     •\tOur relations with the US President, the administration, the Congress and the American people are vital to the State of Israel.\n     •\tThe United States is Israel's main ally and strategic support. Our relations with it are the cornerstone of Israel's military capabilities, the IDF's qualitative edge, and Israel's strategic and political positioning.\n     •\tWe receive $3 billion a year from the US, going back some 40 years now. What social or economic budget items would we forgo to make up the ₪12 billion gap if this assistance disappears?\n     •\tThey're the only ones who can provide us with F-35 jets, the best aircraft in the world.\n     •\tThese are mutually beneficial relations. The US also benefits from the unprecedented cooperation between our intelligence communities. And so do we.\nWe never expected, and will never ask others to fight for us – yet the US has deployed advanced radar systems in Israel to provide early warning against long-range missiles, and holds military exercises on our soil and in the Mediterranean , preparing an American response in case Israel has to defend itself against missile attacks from Iran.\n     •\tWe received about $1 billion from the US, by order of President Obama, for \"Iron Dome\", and assistance for the David's Sling and Arrow programs continues.\n     •\tWe turn to the US to veto hostile initiatives against Israel in the United Nations Security Council. Or to soften the conclusions of the Goldstone Commission and its ilk.\n     •\tIt is to them that we turned (and they responded to the best of their ability) in rather tense times, when a handful of our people were besieged in the embassy in Cairo, with an angry mob at the door.\n     •\tSecretary of State Kerry, and President Obama – went to great lengths – and paid a considerable political (and often personal) price – to help us achieve a breakthrough with the Palestinians, though the effort did not succeed. Nor did we succeed (Rabin and Peres, myself, Olmert and Bibi as well). They shouldn't be ridiculed and debased for this. They should be appreciated. Even if we do not agree on all the details.\n     •\tWe will yet need their help in facing  many trials in the future.\n\n     •\tI recommend that we all remember this well. The rules of working with the Americans: Do not marginalize yourself. Do not fold. Yes – remember what the U.S. is for Israel. And Maintain–at almost any cost – mutual relations of trust and respect. It's good for Israel. \n     •\tThe American Congress, President Obama, Biden and Kerry are part of the solution, even if it tarries. They are not part of the problem.\n\n     •\tBen Gurion used to say, with his iron logic, that \"the future of Israel depends on our strength and our righteousness.\"\n  \"Our strength\" – that is the IDF's might and its strategic capabilities, the backing of the superpowers,  our economic strength, and our social solidarity.\n  \"Our righteousness\" – not as an abstract concept – is our capacity to hold the\"moral high ground\" by means of a calculated effort to behave and be perceived as acting in good faith – to obtain peace, even if it delays.\n     •\tThis is also an an essential condition for achieving internal solidarity and the world's support for Israel (or for the support of most of the world that's important to us).\n     •\tThis is also an essential condition for achieving internal solidarity and willingness for sacrifice in a society where being called for battle or routinely risking your life is not a theoretical notion, but rather part of our life experience that repeats itself time and again.\n     •\tThe fighting spirit, resilience and the internal solidarity are deeply bound to both our strength and our righteousness. Our righteousness is just as important as our strength.\nOur righteousness, and not our strength in and of itself, is what gives Zionism's struggle its meaning and sense of purpose (especially for ones who can choose). The support of a superpower \n     •\tand the resilience of our society and economy, which are among the components of our \"strength\" – will never be without recognition of our righteousness. And without it, they will erode\n.\n     •\tThis is the time to point out the risk in the weakening of the cohesive forces which hold the Israeli society together. We are turning into an increasingly divided society whose very fabric seems to be ripping apart, and which is riddled with hatred for one another. Left and right. Jews and Arabs. Secular and religious. Rich and poor. Center and periphery. Old and new. This is dangerous. The late Tunisian President Bourguiba (and later on Sadat in his debates with Assad just before the peace treaty with Israel) made the argument that there's no need to defeat Israel by force. Give them the opportunity – and they will collapse from within. But the opposite is true!\nWe have no intention of collapsing from within. But this requires that we come to our senses and act with the right national priorities in mind for society and the economy.\n     •\tThe young generation, the future, must be prioritized. And the same applies to those groups in society who carry its burdens:working hard, paying taxes and serving in the IDF. Cultivating  mutual respect, openness, tolerance, and acceptance of others; More equitable distribution of the national wealth; equal opportunities for all and encouraging individuals, groups and communities to take responsibility. All of these are part of our mission – and we have a long road ahead of us.\n\nI am concerned about our addiction to internal quarrels just as much as I am concerned about our conflicts with external opponents. Our \"righteousness\" will not prevail and our \"strength\" will crack over time if we do not act decisively to establish, gradually yet persistently , norms of public life and civil society – which sets norms for what is done and what isn’t done far above the criminal threshold.. We need profound change in the area of respect for the rule of law, standards of governance, keeping the thin line between freedom of expression and freedom of incitement – and immediately hitting the brakes on racism and Jewish terrorism – which in my opinion should be treated within the criminal domain..\n\n     •\tA few sentences on the “nation-state law”. This is a redundant and even harmful law. In general, and particularly at this point. To our friends it signals that Israel is losing its self-confidence regarding the obvious – namely,its unique identity as the Jewish-democratic state as reflected by the \"Declaration of Independence\".\nTo our enemies it provides an effective tool to make Israel a suspect– of being a country that's willingly drifting away from the norms of democracy – as a preliminary step towards institutionalized discrimination.\nAnd one has to wonder: what was wrong with what we had until this point? What's wrong with the \"Declaration of Independence\"? Who needs this? And why?\n\n     •\tChurchill once observed the difference between an optimist and pessimist. \nThe pessimist – sees the difficultly in every opportunity \nThe optimist – sees the opportunity in every difficultly.\n     •\tWe have opportunities before us within all of the difficulties. The most important of all, a rare one, the kind that comes once in a generation – is the opportunity to establish a regional agreement. It is all the more important in light of the \"Arab Spring\" and following \"Operation Protective Edge\".\nThere is an opportunity to establish a regional agreement that fundamentally changes the  realities of the region and Israel's future and status within it. An agreement that will move the region's entire economy forward together with the chance for stability and peace ,based on synergies and collaboration rather than hatred and revenge.\n\n     •\tWhat do I mean? The events in recent years have created a strong common interest for Israel and the moderate Arab countries – Saudi Arabia and the Gulf States, Jordan, Egypt and perhaps even Turkey (which is not Arab). The focal interest is the struggle against radical Islamic terrorism and against Iran's hegemonic and nuclear intentions.\n     •\tThe challenge for us is based on there being, apparently, only one way to achieve that; and the upcoming elections in Israel force us to put it on hold for a few months.\n     •\tAnd the way to do it is this: a strong, self-confident Israel, willing to hold serious negotiations with the Palestinians and the group of Arab nations within an international conference, backed by the US and the Quartet – in order to achieve a two-state solution and establish a regional agreement, while maintaining an unyielding and persistent fight against terrorism and ensuring the IDF's qualitative military edge over any combination of opponents.\n\n     •\tThe moderates among Arab rulers are unable (and also unwilling) to float this common interest and turn it into policy – because they worry how their people would respond. This is how the Palestinian issue is related to possibility of an overall agreement in the Middle East.\n     •\tAnd this isn't just an assessment.\n\n     •\tWe must remember, vis-a-vis the Palestinians, Israel can (practically only) give. Regarding the rest of the moderate Arab world – Israel can also get, and a lot.. \nNot just recognition and legitimacy but also an opportunity for regional infrastructure projects – and mostly – for the beginning of a process, protracted though it may be – to change the region's fundamental attitudes towards Israel.\n\n     •\tOn the road to seize this opportunity – Israel will have to consider embracing the Saudi proposal, with Israel's reservations, as a basis to negotiate  a regional agreement.\n     •\tThis will take time. There will be ups and downs. The Palestinians are not an easy interlocutor. No one knows that better than I do..\n     •\tThis might require long periods of interim agreements and even calculated unilateral steps that are coordinated with the US and the Quartet.\n     •\tIt is possible that within the context of a regional agreement, the Palestinian State, once established, could be integrated into a structure of a closer cooperation that could include Jordan, Israel and perhaps another regional player.\n     •\tBut to advance the chance of a regional agreement after the elections in Israel – the Palestinian issue and the two-state solution must be at the top of the agenda.\n     •\tThe idea that' the radical right raises from time to time – to continue to rule the entire territory and maintain a sort of \"autonomy\" for the Palestinians – is an illusion at best, and the first step of an upcoming blame game at worst. It will be brutally rejected by our closest friends – not to mention by each of the potential partners for the regional agreement – and by all of them together. This too is not a mere assessment.\n\n     •\tThe claim that the events of the past year \"prove\" that Israel's vital security needs are incompatible with the \"two-state solution\" – is false. And I'm stating this as a professional position, not a political opinion.\n     •\tOn the contrary – the IDF will be able to defend Israel better from an internationally recognized border that includes the settlement blocs, a number of strategic sites on mountain ridge, a security zone east of Ben Gurion Airport and long-term military presence on the Jordan River.\n\n     •\tThe real threat to the future of the Zionist Project – is not the security constraints of the \"two-state solution\" but rather a slippery slope leading to the \"one-state solution\" – a reality that would compromise Israel's security and worsen its diplomatic isolation – while inevitably (and this is the keyword) leading Israel into becoming a non-Jewish or non-democratic state. Not to mention the danger of descending into severe, perpetual hemorrhaging, lasting generations, by the two national communities locked in embrace– as we have seen in Belfast and Bosnia.\n\n     •\tThe vision we all share – the vision of a \"model society\" in Israel, of positioning Israel, within 10-15 years,  among the group of the most advanced societies – in education and culture, science and technology, quality of life – and eventually standard of living (Finland and Denmark can do it? So can we!). A society in which its sons and daughters choose to live . And one that young Jews from all over the world consider a source of pride, inspiration – and even a worthy place to live in.\n\n     •\tThe vision of a \"model society\" will not materialize unless we gather our mental strength and political will, despite the pain and the differences in our positions – and together embrace the \"two-state solution under a regional agreement\" – which even if it delays – is the only appropriate and feasible solution, the only realistic and proper goal for Zionism in this complex world of the 21st century.\n\n     •\tA friend (from the Likud, actually) told me that when he was young, he visited Ben Gurion's home a few times. In one of their conversations, the boy asked the Old Man: \"how is it that out of all of the people's leaders in the past 2,000 years, and even in the past 80 years, it was you who ended up founding the Jewish State?\" And the Old Man answered: \"In ancient times, everyone had a sixth sense, a sense of recognizing opportunities. This sense disappeared over time – in most people. But not for me! I saw an opportunity – and I seized it.\"\nBen Gurion did not speak of the horrors of the War of Independence, the doubts, the risks. many assumed we would fail. He talked about the opportunity and recognizing it. And the deed.\n\n     •\tLike Ben Gurion at the time, Menachem Begin – with Egypt, and Rabin – in the peace treaty with Jordan, and later Peres – with the first steps towards the Palestinians, took huge national, diplomatic, security and political risks. Some paid a heavy price. Yitzhak paid the ultimate price. But they all dared – and acted. This is the true test of leadership. This is also the real test of creative statesmanship. \n     •\tFormative leadership had always been rooted in a rare combination and fine balance between vision, daring and courage on one hand and judgment, complete sobriety and grasp of detail on the other. They will not come where anxiety, pessimism and passivity rule – these are recipes for the creating of self-fulfilling (necessarily pessimistic) prophecies.\n\n     •\tThe essence and the purpose of the Zionist movement was to defy the reality and the mindset that the Exile created. Its foundation lay in the decision to take our own fate in our own hands and move proactively to change reality, and not be swept away by the arbitrary waves of history.\n\n     •\tReality is knocking on our door. Not everything is certain. Nothing is ever certain. And nothing ever will be. Nevertheless – open the \n     •\tdoor – this is the true trial of the national leadership.\n     •\tAbba Eban used to say – the Palestinians have never missed an opportunity to miss an opportunity. \n     •\tLet's not fall into this trap – ourselves.\n\n     •\tThank you.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

If successful, this will provide an outstanding platform\nfor ongoing AGI development, as well as a visually appealing and immediately meaningful demo\nfor OpenCog.\n\nSpecific, particularly simple tasks that are the focus of this project team’s current work at\ntime of writing include:\n\ne Watch another character build steps to reach a high-up object\n\ne Figure out via imitation of this that, in a different context, building steps to reach a high\nup object may be a good idea\n\ne Also figure out that, if it wants a certain high-up object but there are no materials for\nbuilding steps available, finding some other way to get elevated will be a good idea that\nmay help it get the object\n\n6.3.1 Transitioning from Virtual Agents to a Physical Robot\n\nPreliminary experiments have also been conducted using OpenCog to control a Nao robot as well\nas a virtual dog [GdGO08]. This involves hybridizing OpenCog with a separate (but interlinked)\nsubsystem handling low-level perception and action. In the experiments done so far, this has\nbeen accomplished in an extremely simplistic way. How to do this right is a topic treated in\ndetail in Chapter 26 of Part 2.\n\nWe suspect that reasonable level of capability will be achievable by simply interposing DeS-\nTIN (or some other system in its place) as a perception /action “black box” between OpenCog\nand a robot. Some preliminary experiments in this direction have already been carried out, con-\nnecting the OpenPetBrain to a Nao robot using simpler, less capable software than DeSTIN in\nthe intermediary role (off-the-shelf speech-to-text, text-to-speech and visual object recognition\nsoftware).\n\nHowever, we also suspect that to achieve robustly intelligent robotics we must go beyond this\napproach, and connect robot perception and actuation software with OpenCogPrime in a “white\nbox” manner that allows intimate dynamic feedback between perceptual, motoric, cognitive\nand linguistic functions. We will achieve this via the creation and real-time utilization of links\nbetween the nodes in CogPrime’s and DeSTIN’s internal networks (a topic to be explored in\nmore depth later in this chapter).\n\n6.4 Memory Types and Associated Cognitive Processes in CogPrime\n\nNow we return to the basic description of the CogPrime approach, turning to aspects of the\nrelationship between structure and dynamics. Architecture diagrams are all very well, but,\nultimately it is dynamics that makes an architecture come alive. Intelligence is all about learning,\nwhich is by definition about change, about dynamical response to the environment and internal\nself-organizing dynamics.\n\nCogPrime relies on multiple memory types and, as discussed above, is founded on the premise\nthat the right course in architecting a pragmatic, roughly human-like AGI system is to handle\ndifferent types of memory differently in terms of both structure and dynamics.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_013026\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

I played an unusual role in that lawsuit,\nin which both sides were focused heavily on the media: Woody was concerned that negative\ncoverage, particularly of allegations involving sexual improprieties with a young girl, might ruin\nhis career; and Mia’s concern that any coverage might hurt her children. Every legal maneuver in\nthe case was made with an eye (sometimes two) on the media.\n\nI first met Woody Allen when he was filming Manhattan.

They probably\nwouldn’t have liked Jews like us from Brooklyn,” Woody mused.\n\n“Yeah, but imagine how different history would be if a Jewish lawyer saved Jesus. They couldn’t\naccuse us of killing their Lord.”\n\n“But he wouldn’t have been their Lord, if you had won. He wouldn’t have been crucified. And\nwithout crucifixion, there’s no Christianity, so if you had won they’d be blaming the Jews for\ndestroying Christianity.”\n\nWoody reminded me of the riff that got Lenny Bruce into so much trouble.

The popular vote margin remains close, with Trump\ncurrently trailing by approximately 200,000 votes out of a total of almost 120 million votes that have\nbeen counted. Clinton’s blue wall of support was pierced by Trump with unexpected wins in\nPennsylvania and Wisconsin. He also won the needed battleground states of Florida, Ohio, and North\nCarolina. With fewer losses than expected, Republicans will retain their majorities in the House and\nSenate, thereby controlling both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue.\nClinton, who called Trump last night to concede the race, said this morning, “I offered to work with him\n[Trump] on behalf of our country” and “our nation is more deeply divided than we thought,” but went on\nto say, “we stand together…and our best days are still ahead of us.” In his remarks shortly before 3:00\nAM, President-elect Trump said, “It is time to bind the wounds of division. It is time for us to come\ntogether as one united America.” He went on to say that it was “not a campaign, but an incredible\nmovement.” And, alluding to his policy agenda, Trump said we “would be working together to begin the\ntask of rebuilding our nation and renewing the American dream.” Trump has touted an agenda of\nrevitalizing the economy and promoting job growth by reforming the tax code, rebuilding America’s\ninfrastructure, repealing and replacing “Obamacare,” and being “tough” on immigration and in\nrenegotiating international trade agreements.\nMaintaining the Senate majority will give Republicans the ability to set the agenda in the\nSenate. However, bipartisan cooperation still will be necessary to achieve meaningful policy\naccomplishments as Senate rules generally require a 60-vote threshold for movement on most\nissues. An early challenge may be filling the Supreme Court vacancy created by the death of Antonin\nScalia in early 2016 – one that could spark fireworks on Capitol Hill and across the country’s highly\ncharged political environment. How Republicans, Democrats, and Trump navigate through the process\nof nominating and confirming a new Justice to the Supreme Court is likely to set the tone in the Senate\nfor the next two years. The nature of Speaker Paul Ryan’s relationship with President-elect Trump and\nhis often unruly House Republican Conference is not clear at this time. However, the House Republican\n“Better Way” agenda, which was developed in consultation with the Trump campaign, is now a focal\npoint for congressional action.\nA\nO\nR\nC\nO\nM\nN\nK\nY\nElectoral votes\nTrump Clinton\n279 228\nLeaning Democratic\nLeaning Republican\n\nContents\nElection results\nSenate profile\nHouse profile\nAdministration and agenda\nLame-duck session 2016\nTax\nHealth\nEnergy\nFinancial services\nTrade\n2\n4\n6\n8\n11\n13\n17\n19\n21\n23\n1 | Election 2016\nElection results\nWith Republicans set to control the White House, Senate, and House\nof Representatives for the session of Congress beginning in January\n2017, the lame-duck session of the current Congress between now\nand the end of this year seems likely to be limited to keeping the\ngovernment funded beyond the expiration of the current continuing\nresolution on December 9, 2016. President-elect Trump and the\nRepublican Congress are certain to provide ambitious policy agendas\nwith plenty of proposals to analyze and the need for significant\nlegislative activity. However, it remains to be seen where Democrats\nand Republicans, particularly in the Senate, will be able to forge\ncompromise.\nWith 24 of the 34 Senate seats up for election on November 8th held\nby Republicans, and many of those seats quite vulnerable, retaining\ncontrol is a major victory for Senate Majority Leader Mitch\nMcConnell (R-KY) and his Republican majority.

In Louisiana, State Treasurer John\nKennedy (R) received 25 percent of the vote and Foster Campbell\n(D), a member of the Louisiana Public Service Commission, received\n17% in a crowded 24 candidate “jungle primary” to advance to a\nrunoff election to be held on December 10, 2016. Senior House\nWays and Means Committee member Charles Boustany (R-LA) fell\njust short in his quest to make the two-candidate runoff receiving\n15% of the vote. While the Louisiana seat is technically undecided,\nthe state went strongly Republican in the Presidential election and\nKennedy is heavily favored to hold the seat.\nIllinois Senator Mark Kirk (R-IL) lost his race to Rep.

In other notable races:\n► Ohio: Once ground zero for Senate control, Senator Rob Portman\n(R-OH) easily beat former Governor Ted Strickland (D-OH).\n► North Carolina: In a race that was consistently within the margin\nof error in recent days, Senator Richard Burr (R-NC) held onto his\nseat against former state legislator Deborah Ross (D-NC).\n► Pennsylvania: Behind in most recent polling, Senator Pat Toomey\n(R-PA) prevailed against former federal and state environmental\nofficial Katie McGinty (D-PA).\nSelect Senate race results\nArizona\nKirkpatrick\nMcCain\nColorado\nBennet\nGlenn\nFlorida\nMurphy\nRubio\nIllinois\nDuckworth\nKirk\nIndiana\nBayh\nYoung\nMissouri\nKander\nBlunt\nNevada\nCortez Masto\nHeck\nNew Hampshire\nHassan\nAyotte ?\nNorth Carolina\nRoss\nBurr\nOhio\nStrickland\nPortman\nPennsylvania\nMcGinty\nToomey\nWisconsin\nFeingold\nJohnson\n2 | Election 2016\nElection results\nAlong with the House GOP majority, Senate Republicans will unambiguously set the agenda in the new Congress. However,\nwith a closely divided Senate, Republicans will be well short of the 60 votes necessary under the Senate rules to bring\ndebate to a close (cloture) and advance controversial legislation without votes from the other party. Narrow Republican\nand Democratic majorities in the recent past have both found their legislative agendas stalled unless they were willing to\ncompromise to attract bipartisan support.\nOne area where 60 votes are not required is confirming appointments to the Administration and the Federal courts, with\nthe exception of the Supreme Court. There could be speculation about whether Senate Republicans would consider a rules\nchange to create a 51 vote threshold for Supreme Court nominees, also known as the “nuclear option.” But any serious\nconsideration on this front is far from certain.\nRepublican House losses in the election were minimized for a number of reasons, including the Republican turnout for\nDonald Trump, the relatively static map created by the post-2010 redistricting process, and highly localized campaigns\nrun by Republican House Members in marginal districts where support for Trump was weaker. With a loss in the single\ndigits, the GOP majority goes from 246 members to somewhere in the 230s, giving Republicans a margin of 20 or so seats\nversus the current 30.\n3 | Election 2016\nSenate profile\nCurrent Majority Leader McConnell will stay in the post after successfully working this past session to keep the Senate in\nRepublican hands, while Senator Charles Schumer (D-NY) will take over for retiring Senator Reid after 12 years as\nDemocratic Leader. Given that Republicans held control of the Senate, McConnell will spend the next two years working\ntoward a filibuster-proof 60-vote majority in the 2018 elections, when 25 Democratic or Independent seats are up for reelection,\ncompared with only eight Republicans. Schumer will likely try to reach some compromises with Republicans while\ndistinguishing his party ahead of 2018, and will likely be pulled left, with the influence of Senators Elizabeth Warren (D-\nMA) and Bernie Sanders (D-VT).\nLeadership elections are expected to be held on Wednesday, November 16, and committee ratios, likely to be close to\nwhat they are now, will be determined soon after the Senate reconvenes. Predicting the chair and ranking members of\nSenate committees immediately after an election is speculative because members with seniority will be able to choose\nbetween chairmanships and must adhere to Senate Republican committee leadership term limits. Republican senators may\nserve as chairman for six years and six years as ranking member for any one committee, on a cumulative basis. Following\nis a discussion of expected select committee chairmen and membership for 2017. An added complication could arise\nshould sitting Republican senators be tapped for cabinet positions in the Trump administration.\nAGRICULTURE, NUTRITION, AND FORESTRY (Same leadership as 114 th Congress)\nChairman Pat Roberts (R-KS)\nRanking Member Debbie Stabenow (D-MI)\nAPPROPRIATIONS\nChairman Thad Cochran (R-MS) Ranking Member ?????\nSeveral Democrats on the committee with significant seniority are in line to choose other ranking positions: Leahy -\nJudiciary; Murray - HELP; Feinstein - Intelligence; Durbin, who serves as the Assistant Democratic Leader, and doesn’t\ntake a ranking member position on a major committee; and Jack Reed - Armed Services. However, given the importance\nof the Appropriations Committee and its responsibility for preparing bills to fund the government, it would be surprising\nthat the ranking position would be very far down that list.\nARMED SERVICES (Same leadership as 114th Congress)\nChairman John McCain (R-AZ)\nRanking Member Jack Reed (D-RI)\nBANKING, HOUSING, AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT\nChairman Mike Crapo (R-ID)\nRanking Member Sherrod Brown (D-OH)\nSenator Richard Shelby (R-AL) has served his six-year limit as Chairman.\nBUDGET\nChairman Mike Enzi (R-WY)\nRanking Member Bernie Sanders (I-VT)\nIf Senator Murray retains the ranking slot on HELP, former presidential candidate Sanders will continue to fill the ranking\nmember role.\nCOMMERCE, SCIENCE, AND TRANSPORTATION (Same leadership as 114th Congress)\nChairman John Thune (R-SD)\nRanking Member Bill Nelson (D-FL)\n4 | Election 2016\nSenate profile\nENERGY AND NATURAL RESOURCES (Same leadership as 114th Congress)\nChairman Lisa Murkowski (R-AK)\nRanking Member Maria Cantwell (D-WA)\nENVIRONMENT AND PUBLIC WORKS (Same leadership as 114th Congress)\nChairman John Barrasso (R-WY)\nRanking Member Tom Carper (D-DE)\nJim Inhofe (R-OK) has exhausted his six-year limit.

Senator Carper could opt for the post over his current position on the Homeland Security and Governmental\nAffairs Committee. If Carper decides to stay at HSGA, Senator Ben Cardin (D-MD) would have the option of ranking\nmember of EPW or Foreign Relations. If Cardin should choose Foreign Relations, Senator Sanders would be next in line for\nthe ranking member position. Barrasso can be expected to continue the criticisms of current Chairman Inhofe of EPA\nregulations and their effect on US energy development and the energy industry.\nFINANCE (Same leadership as 114th Congress)\nChairman Orrin Hatch (R-UT)\nRanking Member Ron Wyden (D-OR)\nSenator Hatch will continue to serve as Chairman by way of an agreement reached with Senator Grassley, who is actually\nmore senior to Senator Hatch on the Committee. (Grassley will serve as Judiciary Chairman.) Dan Coats (R-IN) is retiring\nfrom Congress. Senators Richard Burr (R-NC) and Pat Toomey (R-PA) both won re-election races.

The potential for a Freedom Caucus challenge to Paul Ryan’s leadership is unlikely\ngiven the party’s strong showing. The path is clear for the Speaker to pursue the policy actions described in the “Better\nWay” policy platform developed earlier this year and promoted through the ubiquitous presence of a pamphlet describing\nthe plan that he used during the campaign and press appearances. That effort generated interest from Trump, who\nadapted his tax plan to reflect some of the proposals.\nThe week following the elections and prior to Thanksgiving will be focused on internal party organizational issues,\nincluding the election of party leadership, and discussion around Republican conference and Democratic caucus rules and\nthe makeup of the Steering Committee, which will determine committee assignments. The leadership of the chamber will\nbe decided in closed-door meetings during this time, with a formal floor vote for Speaker in January. Some Steering\nCommittee decisions regarding committees are likely to take place after Thanksgiving and to include ratification of\ncommittee chairmanships and Speaker-appointed committee memberships, as well as appointments of members to vacant\nslots on “A” committees (including Ways and Means, Energy and Commerce and Financial Services). Ryan and Democratic\nLeader Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) will conduct a negotiation to determine committee ratios, which would be expected to be close\nto what they are now.\nWAYS AND MEANS (Same leadership as 114th Congress)\nChairman Kevin Brady (R-TX)\nRanking Member Sander Levin (D-MI)\nRepublican members Boustany and Young ran for Senate ,and Rep. Robert Dold (R-IL) lost his re-election campaign,\nleaving three open seats. Republicans under consideration for Committee seats include Reps. Carlos Curbelo (R-FL), Mike\nBishop (R-MI), Bradley Byrne (R-AL), Jackie Walorski (R-IN) and Andy Barr (R-KY). Longtime Democratic members Charles\nRangel (D-NY) and Jim McDermott (D-WA) are retiring.\nENERGY & COMMERCE\nChair John Shimkus (R-IL)/Greg Walden (R-OR)\nRanking Member Frank Pallone (D-NJ)\nRep. Fred Upton (R-MI) will reach his term limit as chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee and will step down at\nthe end of the current Congress. Rep. Upton noted that he’s “not planning to” seek a waiver of the term limits. The two\ncurrent frontrunners to replace the outgoing chairman include Reps. John Shimkus (R-IL) and Greg Walden (R-OR). Rep.\nShimkus has seniority on the committee, but Walden has also generated party support related to his role serving as\nchairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee for the past two election cycles. Rep. Joe Barton (R-TX) is\nalso expected to run for the Chairmanship. The powerful Republican Steering Committee, consisting of Republican\nleadership as well as rank-and-file members, will decide in a private meeting who will lead the committee in the 115 th\nCongress. Adding to the leadership shuffle at the Energy and Commerce Committee, the current chairman of the E&C\nSubcommittee on Health, Rep. Joe Pitts (R-PA), is retiring at the end of the Congress. Rep. Tim Murphy (R-PA) is under\nconsideration to replace him.\nEDUCATION & THE WORKFORCE\nChairman Virginia Foxx (R-NC)\nRanking Member Bobby Scott (D-VA)\nCurrent Chairman John Kline (R-MN) did not seek reelection. He will likely be succeeded as chair of the House Education\nand Workforce Committee by Rep. Foxx. She has had a limited role on pension and retirement issues, but has been a\nreliable voice for limited government regulation and joined in opposing the Obama Administration’s investment advice\nregulations.

President-elect Trump highlighted\nhis commitment to infrastructure investment during his\nvictory speech early November 9. “We are going to fix our\ninner cities and rebuild our highways, bridges, tunnels,\nairports, schools, hospitals,” he said. “We’re going to\nrebuild our infrastructure, which will become, by the way,\nsecond to none. And we will put millions of our people to\nwork as we rebuild it.” Trump would fund infrastructure\ninvestment through public-private partnerships and\nprivate investments through tax incentives rather than\ntax reform, though he has called for early action on that\nissue as well. On October 22, Trump outlined a voter\ncontract for his first 100 days plan that calls for\nenactment of:\n► The Middle Class Tax Relief And Simplification Act\n(comprehensive tax reform);\n► The End the Offshoring Act, to establish tariffs to\ndiscourage companies from laying off their workers in\norder to relocate in other countries and ship their\nproducts back to the U.S. tax-free;\n► The American Energy & Infrastructure Act, to leverage\npublic-private partnerships and private investments\nthrough tax incentives to raise $1 trillion in\ninfrastructure investment over 10 years;\n► The School Choice And Education Opportunity Act, to\nexpand primary education options and make college\nmore affordable;\n► The Repeal and Replace Obamacare Act, to repeal the\nACA and replace it with Health Savings Accounts;\n► The Affordable Childcare and Eldercare Act, to allow\nAmericans to deduct childcare and elder care;\n► The End Illegal Immigration Act, to fund the\nconstruction of a wall on the Mexican border;\n► The Restoring Community Safety Act, to reduce crime;\n► The Restoring National Security Act, to rebuild the\nmilitary by eliminating the defense sequester and\nexpanding military investment; and\n► The Clean up Corruption in Washington Act, to enact\n“new ethics reforms to Drain the Swamp and reduce\nthe corrupting influence of special interests on our\npolitics.”\nAs part of the voter contract announced in October,\nTrump has also pledged to act on his first day in office to\n“cancel every unconstitutional executive action,\nmemorandum and order issued by President Obama.”\nTrump advisor Anthony Scaramucci said in October that\nthe new administration would repeal the rulemaking on\nconflicts of interest in the delivery of investment advice to\nIRA and 401(k) plan investors.\nRegulations that have been finalized cannot be\nunilaterally vacated by executive order without\nintervening regulatory or legislative action. In order to\nmake changes to final regulations without legislative\naction, agencies are typically required to follow the\nadministrative procedural process which requires a notice\nand comment process prior to modifying regulations. If\nan Administration wishes to repeal or revise a final\nregulation through the administrative process, the agency\nmay be required to demonstrate that its actions are not\n“arbitrary and capricious,” and based on more than a\nchange in political views. It is possible that a new\nAdministration could dispense with the notice and\ncomment process by moving to issue an interim final rule,\nreplacing the previous regulation. In this situation, the\nagency could be called on demonstrate that it acted with\n“good cause” to circumvent the typical notice and\ncomment requirements.\nA new Administration could also use its executive power\nto affect the level of legal defense of challenges to\nexisting regulations provided by the Administration or\ntemporarily refuse to exercise its enforcement\nresponsibilities until compelled through legal action or\npublic pressure.\nTrump also intends to immediately begin the process of\nfilling the Supreme Court vacancy created by the death of\nAntonin Scalia in early 2016 – one that could spark\nfireworks on Capitol Hill and across the country’s highly\ncharged political environment. How Republicans,\nDemocrats, and Trump navigate through the process of\nnominating and confirming a Justice to the Supreme\nCourt is likely to set the tone in the Senate for the next\ntwo years.\nTrump also intends to act on trade issues on his first day\nin office, including:\n► announcing his intention to renegotiate or withdraw\nfrom NAFTA;\n► ·announcing withdrawal from the Trans-Pacific\nPartnership; and\n8\n| Election 2016\nAdministration and\nagenda\n► directing Treasury to label China a currency\nmanipulator.\nConsistent with Trump’s desire to change the way\nbusiness is conducted in Washington, he also pledges to\nact on his first day in office to:\n► propose a constitutional amendment to impose term\nlimits on all members of Congress;\n► require that for every new federal regulation, two\nexisting regulations must be eliminated; and\n► impose a five–year ban on White House and\ncongressional officials becoming lobbyists after they\nleave government service.\n(The Trump Contract with the Voter is available at\nhttps://assets.donaldjtrump.com/CONTRACT_FOR_THE_\nVOTER.pdf)\nBudget. While President-elect Trump has vowed to act\nquickly on repeal of the ACA, it is difficult to see how that\ncan be accomplished outside of reconciliation instructions\nfor FY 2018. “When we win on November 8th, and elect a\nRepublican Congress, we will be able to immediately\nrepeal and replace Obamacare. I will ask Congress to\nconvene a special session,” he said November 1.\nAn early focus of attention will be the first Trump budget\nproposal and the congressional FY 2018 budget\nresolution. As with the past several years under divided\ngovernment, a main issue will be how to address the\nBudget Control Act sequester for FY 2018. According to\nthe Congressional Budget Office, the cap on discretionary\nbudget authority originally established by the Budget\nControl Act is set at $1.156 billion in 2018, though it will\nbe reduced by automatic procedures unless Congress\nintervenes. CBO said the reduction will total $91 billion\nfor 2018: $54 billion for defense and $37 billion in 2018\nfor nondefense. Therefore, total budget authority is\nslated to be $1.065 trillion, split between $549 billion for\ndefense and $516 billion for nondefense. Both Trump and\nSpeaker Ryan want to eliminate the sequester as it\napplies to defense, but would likely want to maintain the\nsequester for non-defense spending.\nAs reported in Politico last month, Speaker Ryan is bullish\non using the “budget reconciliation” process to pass\nsignificant tax reform. “This is our plan for 2017,” Ryan\nsaid, waving a copy of his “Better Way” policy agenda.\n“Much of this you can do through budget reconciliation.”\nHe said key pieces are “fiscal in nature,” meaning they\ncan be moved quickly through a budget maneuver that\nrequires a simple majority in the Senate and House.\n9\nUse of “Budget Reconciliation” to enact legislation\ninvolves a two-step process. First, both Chambers of\nCongress need to pass a concurrent Budget Resolution\n(requires only simple majority in the Senate) that contains\n“reconciliation instructions.” These instructions are\ndirections to committees of jurisdiction to change the\nspending or revenue numbers (or both), and to report\nback the changes by a date certain. A budget resolution\ngenerally is a legislative vehicle that serves as the\nblueprint for fiscal policy and establishes a framework for\nconsideration of spending and revenue bills for the\ncoming fiscal year. Technically, a budget resolution is a\n“concurrent resolution” which is binding in the House and\nthe Senate. Because a concurrent resolution is not\nsubmitted to the President for signature, it does not have\nthe force of law.\nThe second part of the process is to pass “reconciliation”\nbills that adhere to the reconciliation instructions from\nthe budget resolution.\nReconciliation bills can involve changes to spending,\nrevenue, or the debt limit (or any combination of the\nthree). Importantly, these reconciliation bills also only\nrequire a simple majority in the House and Senate for\npassage.\nReconciliation bills carry strict debate time and\namendment restrictions, but unlike a budget resolution,\nreconciliation legislation contains specific spending and\nrevenue policy changes that are signed into law by the\nPresident. In the Senate, debate is limited to 20 hours.\nWhile only a simple majority is required for passage in the\nSenate, 60 votes are required to waive violations of the\nso-called “Byrd rule,” which prohibits the inclusion of\nprovisions that increase the budget deficit for the period\noutside the budget window, usually a 10-year period. An\nunlimited number of amendments may be offered and\nvoted upon, even after the 20 hours of debate have\nexpired – a process often referred to as a “vote-a-rama”.\nThis process is attractive because of the simple majority\nvote in the Senate, but carries with it restrictions such as\nthe ten-year expiration for titles of the bill that increase\nthe deficit outside the budget window.\nIt was used by President George W. Bush to pass\nsignificant tax cut legislation in 2001 (the “Bush tax\ncuts”) and is expected to be considered next year for tax\nreform. Note that the Bush tax cuts were originally\nsunsetted at the end of ten years due to the Byrd\nrule. Subsequent legislation passed outside reconciliation\nprocess made many of these provisions permanent.\n| Election 2016\nAdministration and\nagenda\nDebt limit. The debt limit will be reinstated after March\n15, 2017, though Congress will likely have additional time\nto either suspend or increase the limit. Extraordinary\nmeasures that can be undertaken by the Treasury\nDepartment should allow Treasury to continue meeting its\nfinancial obligations until at least midsummer of 2017,\naccording to a September 13 posting by the Bipartisan\nPolicy Center. When the debt limit is reinstated, the\nfederal government’s accumulated debt will immediately\nequal the new ceiling, which is projected to be\nabout $20.1 trillion. The optics of the figure surpassing\n$20 trillion could spur lawmakers to be even more\nadamant about demands for spending cuts in return for\nsupporting an additional increase or suspension of the\ndebt limit.\nFAA reauthorization. The Airport and Airway Trust Fund\ntaxes expire after September 30, 2017, along with\nFederal Aviation Administration (FAA) spending authority,\nboth of which were last extended in July. Privatization of\nthe air traffic control system was a sticking point in\nnegotiations this year. The FAA bill can be a vehicle for\nother tax legislation.\nPersonnel. The fact that Trump has not held political\noffice and is not a traditional Republican puts a new spin\non filling out his administration. Press reports have\nspeculated about potential cabinet appointments. Trump\nhas reportedly said that Goldman Sachs alumnus and\ncampaign finance chairman Steven Mnuchin could be a\npossible nominee for Treasury secretary.\nEconomic advisers that have represented Trump on the\ncampaign include investor Wilbur Ross and economists\nPeter Navarro, Larry Kudlow, and Stephen Moore.\nNew Jersey Gov. Chris Christie is in charge of Trump’s\ntransition. Politicians who have supported and served as\nsurrogates for Trump and could possibly be tapped for\nCabinet posts include: former New York mayor Rudy\nGiuliani, former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, Senator\nJeff Sessions (R-AL), Dr. Ben Carson, and former Alaska\nGovernor Sarah Palin. Senate Foreign Relations\nCommittee Chairman Bob Corker (R-TN) was reportedly\nunder consideration for the vice presidential pick and\ncould be tapped for a Cabinet post.\nEconomic packages pursued by past presidents\nBarack Obama\nTook office January 20, 2009\nGeorge W.

Congress returns the week of November 14\nfor organizational meetings and then departs again for\nThanksgiving week, leaving lawmakers only a couple of\nweeks to finish their legislative business. Other\npossibilities include: a defense authorization bill; the\nconference report for an omnibus energy bill; the “21 st\nCentury Cures” bill increasing funds for medical research\nand accelerating drug approvals; the Water Resources\nDevelopment Act (WRDA), which would also carry money\nto address the drinking-water crisis in Flint, Michigan; tax\nextenders provisions; and retirement savings measures.\nGovernment Funding. Under the stopgap continuing\nresolution (CR) cleared on September 28, funding for the\ngovernment will expire on December 9. Only one of the\n12 fiscal 2017 appropriations bills has been sent to the\nPresident so far. The government funding bill may take\nthe form of a large omnibus bill or continuing resolution,\nif the House and Senate Republican leadership’s\npreference for moving spending bills on a standalone\nbasis or in packages does not pan out. Given the election\nresults, leaders are likely to limit the length of the\nspending bill to a handful of months to allow the Trump\nadministration an opportunity to help shape fiscal 2017\nspending next year. Speaker Ryan has said he favors a\nstrategy of combining spending bills into “minibus”\nvehicles, but Senate Democrats have said such an\napproach could be a tactic to get around the spending\ncaps Congress agreed to on a bipartisan basis last year.\nThe bill(s) may include additional spending to address\nflooding in Louisiana and elsewhere, and damage from\nHurricane Matthew. If the vehicle for government funding\nis a large omnibus bill, Republicans may push for some\nconservative policy “riders” as their price for accepting\nthe budget numbers that were negotiated last year.\nTax. There are no must-pass tax issues for the lame-duck\nsession, and it is unclear whether there will be\nconsideration of expiring tax provisions, House and\nSenate miscellaneous tax bills, and tax technical\ncorrections. House Ways and Means Chairman Brady is\nopposed to addressing tax extender provisions this year,\npreferring to look forward to tax reform; that could also\nbe the position taken on other tax issues given that\nRepublicans will control Washington and have a shared\ninterest in tax reform. However, Senate Leader McConnell\npreviously committed to addressing energy tax extenders\nthis year, so they could still come up for consideration.\n11\nPensions. The Senate could consider the Retirement\nEnhancement and Savings Act, a package of measures\naffecting multiple-employer pension plans, 401(k) plans\nand annuities, which was approved on a unanimous vote\nby the Senate Finance Committee on September 21. The\ncommittee also approved the Miners Protection Act, which\nwould fund retiree health and pension benefits for coal\nminers, which a majority of the committee’s Republican\nmembers opposed.\nHealth. One of the top Republican legislative priorities for\nthe lame-duck session is the 21 st Century Cures bill, a\npackage of measures intended to spur new medical\ntreatments and boost funding for the National Institutes of\nHealth, the FDA, and White House initiatives such as\n“precision medicine” and the Cancer Moonshot. Questions\nremain in both the House and Senate over how to pay for\nthe bill and the size of the funding increases, but Senator\nMcConnell has said the bill “could end up being the most\nsignificant piece of legislation we pass in the whole\nCongress.”\nOn the House side, this continues to be the top priority of\nthe Chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee\nFred Upton. Leaders of the Energy and Commerce\nCommittee said on September 29 that they had been\n“working hard for months, and we will continue to work\ntoward an agreement that can pass both chambers and be\nsigned by the President.” The House passed its version of\nthe 21 st Century Cures bill (H.R. 6) in July 2015 by a vote\nof 344-77, including nearly $9 billion in new research\nfunding for the NIH and reforms to the FDA’s process for\napproving certain new medicines and medical devices. In\nthe Senate, the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions\n(HELP) Committee has passed a package of 19 bills aimed\nat accelerating approval of new drugs and medical devices\nand attracting talented researchers to the FDA, but the full\nSenate has yet to consider the bills. HELP Committee\nChairman Lamar Alexander (R-TN) told Bloomberg BNA in\nJune that the impediments to passage are the proposals’\ncomplexity and disagreements over how to pay for\nthem. Negotiations continue.\nSpeaker Ryan has also listed passage of mental health\nlegislation as one of his priorities for the lame-duck\nsession. H.R. 2646, a bill sponsored by Rep. Tim Murphy\n(R-PA) that passed the House almost unanimously in July,\nwould expand Medicaid coverage of mental health\nservices, fund more psychiatric hospital beds and change\nprivacy rules to allow caregivers to receive more\ninformation about patients.\n| Election 2016\nLame-duck session\nA Senate version (S. 2680) prompted Democratic\nconcerns over funding levels, privacy issues, and other\nmatters. This issue is one that could slip into the next\nCongress if negotiators are unable to reach an agreement\ngiven the limited time available.\nAnother outstanding year-end issue for Congressional\nleaders is whether to address the pending Medicare Part-\nB premium increases facing new and some existing\nMedicare enrollees caused by a smaller annual Social\nSecurity cost-of-living adjustment (COLA). Congress has\nacted in the past to avert premium increases due to\nmodest COLA adjustments before the premium increases\ntake effect. Additional Medicare changes that are\nbipartisan in nature could be added to this Part B\nadjustment if leaders agree to move forward. Up for\npotential consideration are a handful of Medicare-related\nbills that have already passed the House or Senate in the\n114 th Congress, as well as a package of provisions\nrecently unveiled by the Finance Committee that would\naddress how chronic conditions are managed in the\nMedicare population.\nAdditionally, Congress continues to contemplate action in\nthe lame duck session to address the Obama\nAdministration’s proposal to modify the payment\nmechanisms for Part B Medicare drugs. While the\nproposal has not yet been finalized, concerns about the\nsize and scope of the proposal have been raised by\nCongress.\nEnergy. House and Senate conferees also hope to finish\nnegotiating the final version of the bipartisan, omnibus\nEnergy Policy Modernization Act (S. 2012, H.R. 8).\nAmong many other provisions, that bill would give the\nEnergy Department emergency authority to protect the\nelectric power grid from physical and cyber threats;\nrequire the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission\n(FERC) to expedite consideration of pipeline siting\napplications; ease procedures for mining certain minerals\non federal lands; increase water allocations to address\ndrought in California; and change forestry management.\nThere will also be a push to complete the Water Resources\nDevelopment Act (WRDA). In September, both the Senate\n(S. 2848) and House (H.R. 5303) overwhelmingly passed\nbills that need to be reconciled, but the two chambers\nhave not yet formally gone to conference. One factor that\nis likely to expedite a conference and floor votes is the fact\nthat in September, in order to resolve a deadlock over\ngovernment funding, Speaker Ryan made a commitment\nto move assistance to Flint, Michigan (which has faced a\ndrinking-water crisis) as part of the WRDA bill.\nEnergy measures could also come up as Republican\n“riders” on a year-end spending bill, such as provisions\nblocking the EPA’s Clean Power Plan or the “Waters of the\nU.S.” wetlands rule. House Majority Leader McCarthy has\nalso said the House will consider a bill offering a tax credit\nfor new nuclear reactors.\nFinancial Services. House Financial Services Chairman\nJeb Hensarling (R-TX) has said he hopes for a lame-duck\nfloor vote on his CHOICE Act, which would repeal much of\nthe Dodd-Frank Act and replace it with a system in which\nbanks would become exempt from many prudential rules if\nthey agree to a much higher leverage ratio. The committee\npassed the CHOICE Act on a party-line vote in September.\nThe Wells Fargo scandal could pose a hurdle for that plan,\nbecause Hensarling’s bill would repeal the Consumer\nFinancial Protection Bureau’s (CFPB) new rules limiting the\nuse of mandatory arbitration clauses in bank contracts.\nWells Fargo has been criticized for requiring its account\nholders to agree to such clauses, restricting their ability to\nsue the bank after as many as 2 million unauthorized\naccounts were discovered.\nThe Financial Services Committee will hold a second\nhearing on November 30 on the Wells Fargo issue, with\nCFPB Director Richard Cordray testifying. SEC Chairman\nMary Jo White will also testify on November 15.\n12\n| Election 2016\nTax\nThe surprising results of yesterday’s election have teed\nup comprehensive tax reform as a clear priority for the\nnew Republican President and the Republican Congress.\nA unified Republican government makes the process of\nachieving significant tax reform much more manageable\nnext year, in particular because Speaker Ryan during the\ncampaign pledged to move such a plan in the form of socalled\nbudget reconciliation legislation, which would mean\nthat only a simple majority of senators would be\nnecessary to pass the plan, rather than the usual 60-vote\nmajority. A lot of the groundwork has been laid through\nproposals and negotiations over the last three or four\nyears on various key aspects of business tax reform, but\nCongressional Republican leaders and the new President\nwill have to decide whether to push forward with\nlegislation that embodies the House Republican Tax\nReform Blueprint, or the outlines of a tax reform plan that\nPresident-elect Trump championed during the campaign.\nOne significant difference is that the Blueprint, according\nto its authors, is largely revenue neutral using dynamic\nscoring, while the Trump plan was scored by various nongovernmental\ngroups as losing trillions of dollars.\nHouse Speaker Ryan has said on multiple occasions that\ntax reform is his top priority. The Blueprint, the sixth and\nfinal plank of Ryan’s “Better Way” campaign to provide\npolicy alternatives, proposed a 20% statutory corporate\ntax rate, a 25% business tax rate for pass-through\nentities, a move toward a cash-flow consumption tax\nthrough immediate expensing for all businesses and\nelimination of deductibility of net interest expense, a\nterritorial international tax system, a border tax\nadjustment mechanism, and elimination of most business\npreferences except the R&D tax credit and LIFO.\nInterestingly, all of these pieces of business tax reform\nmay be fair game in discussions with Democrats, but the\ntwo parties differ greatly over whether to reduce\nindividual tax rates – a key component of both the\nBlueprint and the Trump campaign agenda – and over\nimportant revenue issues, including whether reform\nshould be revenue neutral on a static basis, and whether\ntiming and one-time revenue raisers should be used to\npay for permanent tax rate reduction. The use of budget\nreconciliation, however, could make many of these\ndifferences irrelevant as Senate Democrats could have\nlittle power to change or block the legislation on the\nSenate floor.\nAlong with the 20% statutory corporate tax rate, the\nBlueprint includes a 25% business tax rate for passthrough\nentities; and individual rates set at 12%, 25%, and\n33%.\n13\nWays and Means Republican tax staff is in the process of\nreceiving feedback and building out the tax reform\nBlueprint by drafting detailed statutory language. The\npublicly expressed goal is to have that effort completed\nby the end of 2016. In October 14 remarks at University\nof Wisconsin—Madison, House Speaker Ryan said, “I really\nwant to get tax reform running as quickly as possible…”\nAsked September 29 whether there is opportunity for\nprogress on big-ticket items in 2017, Senate Majority\nLeader McConnell said, “We need to do tax-reform –\ncomprehensive tax-reform – not piecemeal.”\nTrump’s tax plan differs from the Blueprint in that the\ncorporate tax rate would be lower – 15% – with the same\nrate imposed on pass through entities. The latest\nstatement from the Trump campaign suggests that small\nbusiness owners do not retain earnings may face double\ntaxation.\nIndividual income tax rates would be 12%, 25%, and 33%,\nthe same as the House Republican tax reform Blueprint.\nTrump and his staff have supported a 10% tax rate on the\ndeemed repatriation of previously untaxed foreign\nearnings of US companies, but the campaign never made\nclear whether they still support repeal of deferral in a new\ninternational tax system going forward.\nTrump has pledged to work with House Republicans on\ntax issues and, in addition to adopting their proposed\nindividual rates, brought his plan closer to theirs by\nannouncing support for immediate expensing of new\nbusiness investments for manufacturers. The House plan\nproposed expensing in conjunction with eliminating the\ndeductibility of net interest expense. In the follow-up to a\nSeptember 15 speech to the Economic Club of New York,\nTrump clarified that he believes expensing should be\nlimited to manufacturers and those who elect expensing\nwill lose the deductibility of corporate interest expense.\nThe Trump campaign also clarified in September that they\nfavored repeal of most corporate tax expenditures,\nexcept for the R&D Credit. While continuing to call for\nrepeal of the estate tax, Trump proposed disallowing a\nstep-up in basis for estates over $10 million: “The Trump\nplan will repeal the death tax, but capital gains held until\ndeath will be subject to tax, with the first $10 million taxfree\nas under current law to exempt small businesses and\nfamily farms. To prevent abuse, contributions of\nappreciated assets into a private charity established by\nthe decedent or the decedent’s relatives will be\ndisallowed.”\n| Election 2016\nTax\nTrump additionally proposed capping itemized deductions\nat $100,000 for single filers and $200,000 for married\nfilers and highlighted the benefits of his proposals for\nworking Americans and the middle class. “By lowering\nrates, streamlining deductions, and simplifying the\nprocess, we will add millions and millions of new jobs. In\naddition, because we have strongly capped deductions for\nthe wealthy, and closed special interest loopholes, the tax\nrelief will be concentrated on the working and middle\nclass taxpayer…,” he said. “This is a working and middleclass\ntax relief proposal.” A campaign fact sheet\nproclaims that Trump’s economic proposals would add 25\nmillion jobs over a decade, which equates to 200,000 new\njobs per month.\nThe motivating factors for tax reform will remain the\nsame as they were in the current Congress, but unified\ngovernment should make enacting tax reform much\neasier. The statutory corporate income tax rate is seen as\ntoo high and the international tax system compels profit\nshifting to low-tax jurisdictions and erodes the US tax\nbase. That phenomenon escalated this year with the\nEuropean Commission’s latest state aid decision, which\nwas seen as demonstrating a tension between the US and\nEurope over who should tax the foreign income of US\nmultinationals.\nThe passage of the EU’s harmful tax competition directive\nwill lead to enactment in all EU countries of a variety of\nmeasures that could increase taxes on US companies\noperating in Europe, while implementation of innovation\nbox regimes in many countries, following the OECD BEPS\nproject outline, will make it more attractive for US\ncompanies to move intellectual property and exploit that\nIP into those jurisdictions. The Administration took\nsignificant steps this year to try to prevent further\nerosion of the US tax base through regulatory action to\ndeter inversions and earnings stripping, but all involved\nsaid these were Band-Aid approaches that were no\nsubstitute for US tax reform.\nDesign issues – international tax reform. As has been the\ncase for the last few years, there is broad agreement on\nthe design elements of business tax reform, and more\nspecifically, international tax reform, but the devil is in\nthe details. For example, the House Republican Blueprint\non tax reform calls for a 8.75% tax rate on previously\nuntaxed accumulated foreign earnings held in cash or\ncash equivalents, and a 3.5% tax rate on all other\naccumulated earnings, with tax liability payable over an\neight-year period.\nThis is the same tax treatment of accumulated foreign\nearnings called for under former Ways and Means\nCommittee Chairman Dave Camp’s (R-MI) Tax Reform Act\nof 2014.\nBut in a departure from the Camp bill, the Blueprint also\ncalls for a move to a destination-basis tax system, under\nwhich border adjustments exempt exports from tax while\ntaxing imports, making the tax jurisdiction the location of\nconsumption rather than production. Exempting exports\nfrom US tax and taxing imports regardless of where they\nare produced will eliminate incentives for US businesses\nto move or locate operations outside of the United States\nunder a territorial tax system, according to the Blueprint.\nBy relieving exports from US tax while imposing US tax on\nimports, the Blueprint would eliminate the need for any\nnew exemption or territorial tax system to be\naccompanied by a minimum tax or any other more\nconventional anti-base erosion measure, thereby\nsidestepping one of the more intractable and divisive\ndebates among the business community over the past\nseveral years of tax reform discussions.\nDeveloping a workable border adjustability mechanism\nthat is not actually a component of a value-added tax\npresents some significant policy and technical hurdles.\nUS companies that are net exporters could end up in a\nperpetual tax loss position, and handing out refunds to\nsome of the largest US companies may not work from a\npolitical standpoint, particularly as the domestic income\nof US companies (including the suppliers for exporting\ncompanies) is subject to tax. How to apply the border\nadjustability concept to cross-border flows of capital, or\nwhether to exempt financial transactions must also be\nconsidered.\nWhile moving to a form of exemption system has some\nlevel of bipartisan support, more liberal Democrats will\ninsist on a more pure worldwide system that includes\nrepeal of deferral. Senate Finance Committee Ranking\nMember Wyden (intermittently) and Senator Warren\n(consistently) have both backed the latter approach, and\nSpeaker Ryan noted the differing viewpoints in\nSeptember given that Democrats increasingly call for a\nworldwide system and repeal of deferral.\n14\n| Election 2016\nTax\n“There is a big gulf between our two views... We believe\nthat we should have a pure territorial system… And so I do\nbelieve that this issue is coming,” Ryan said. “I don’t think\nyou can stand against a territorial system much longer.”\nRyan also remarked that “the experience I had when I was\nWays and Means chair with [Democrats] was not a\npleasant one, and I don’t know if that’s going to change.”\nIn a September 8 New York Times op-ed, Senator Warren\nsaid foreign developments are increasing pressure on\nCongress to cut corporations “a new sweetheart deal” in\ntax reform, but lawmakers should instead take the\nopportunity to collect more revenue from corporations.\n“Preferential tax treatment, either through special rates\nor deferred due dates, creates a huge financial incentive\nfor American companies to build businesses and create\njobs abroad rather than in the United States. Our tax code\nshould favor jobs and businesses at home – period,”\nWarren said.\nAlong with these political and mechanical questions, there\nis the question of whether such a system, embedded in an\nincome tax rather than a value added tax or other true\nconsumption tax, is legal from an international trade\nperspective.\nDesign issues – paying for rate reduction. There may\nalso be tension among House Republicans given that the\nBlueprint has not had a full airing among members – it\nwas released soon before Congress left for its summer\nrecess – and the drafting of legislative language may\nmake apparent what is necessary to achieve the stated\ngoals, particularly the reduced rates: a 20% statutory\ncorporate tax rate; a 25% business tax rate for passthrough\nentities; and individual rates set at 12%, 25%, and\n33%. Once the details are hashed out, the Blueprint could\npresent just as many trade-offs as previous serious tax\nreform proposals. While the mix of winners and losers\nmay be different than under other proposals, the ultimate\nfate of the Blueprint will still be determined by the same\nfundamental political dynamics that would face any tax\nreform proposal.\nFor example, the Blueprint would permit companies to\nfully and immediately deduct the cost of all tangible and\nintangible property, with the exception of land. However,\nthe Blueprint also would correspondingly deny deductions\nfor net interest expense. Companies must therefore\nweigh whether losing interest deductions is a cost they\nare willing to incur in exchange for full expensing (and a\n20% corporate rate).\nThe purpose for denying deductions for net interest\nexpense is to prevent a presumed double benefit from\nfully expensing leveraged purchases of property.\nHowever, the exclusion of land from full expensing under\nthe Blueprint would be particularly severe for debtfinanced\npurchases of land because the land would not be\neligible for full expensing (or apparently even\ndepreciation as under current law), while deductions for\ninterest expense on the debt would not be permitted.\nMoreover, the persistent issues under current law\ninvolving the allocation of purchase price between nondeductible\nland and immediately deductible\nimprovements on the land would be intensified under the\nBlueprint. Other aspects of paying for a reduced\ncorporate rate will not come easier in the new Congress.\nThe allure of reducing business tax rates did not draw\nmembers to support the bill presented to them by former\nWays and Means Chairman Dave Camp.\nCorporate integration. In the Senate, Finance Committee\nChairman Hatch continues to go his own direction on tax\nreform, touting a corporate integration plan that could be\na substitute for or be complementary to a rate reduction\neffort that includes international tax reform. Hatch says\nhe is still aiming to release a corporate integration\ndiscussion draft. Chairman Hatch has said the proposal\ncould accomplish the international tax reform that is\nwidely seen as necessary, and the reception to the draft\ncould dictate how strongly he tries to advance the\nproposal next year. The draft is expected to pair a\ndividends-paid deduction with a mandatory 35%\nwithholding tax for dividends and interest. Other senators\nand third parties have raised concerns about a corporate\nintegration plan, including:\n► that the proposed 35% withholding tax expected would\npenalize tax-exempt entities like retirement plans and\ndeter foreign investment in the United States; and\n► that a dividends paid deduction would, by reducing\ncorporate tax liability, diminish the effectiveness of\ncurrent tax incentives like the R&D credit and\naccelerated depreciation, and disadvantage startup\ncompanies more likely to retain their earnings rather\nthan pay dividends.\nExtenders. The fate of tax extenders (and certain other\ntax issues) will likely depend on both what can be\naccomplished during the 2016 lame-duck session and the\nsuccess of the likely focus on tax reform in early 2017.\n15\n| Election 2016\nTax\nThere is a push to include the provisions that expire at the\nend of 2016 in year-end legislation, though if that is\nunsuccessful the issue will certainly return in 2017, either\nthrough inclusion in a tax reform measure or separately if\nthose efforts have played out.\nThe 2015 tax legislation made some extender provisions\npermanent and extended others for five years, meaning\nthe two-year extensions that expire at the end of 2016\nwill be the focus of the next effort.\nThere will certainly be attention paid to these provisions\nduring any discussion of tax extenders in 2017.\nTax treaties. Action on the eight Foreign Relations\nCommittee-approved tax treaties that Senator Rand Paul\n(R-KY) wants renegotiated over information sharing\nconcerns is seen as overdue. The treaties include: new\nprotocols amending US tax treaties with Switzerland,\nLuxembourg, Spain and Japan; new tax treaties with\nHungary, Chile and Poland; and a multilateral convention\non tax administration. There have been no plans\nannounced for trying to move the treaties during the\nlame-duck session, though such an effort is possible.\nState tax issues. In August, House Judiciary Committee\nChairman Goodlatte released a second discussion draft\nrelated to remote sales tax that would apply tax at the\ndestination state of the goods, rather than on the location\nof the seller, which was his previous approach. The tax\nwould be imposed at a single rate determined by the state\nof the purchaser, but using the tax base of the state of\norigin.\nChairman Goodlatte wanted a vote this year on the\nproposal, which had the support of Speaker Ryan, but this\nvote is not likely to occur during the lame duck session.\nWhen Congress approved a customs reauthorization\nmeasure that made permanent the Internet Tax Freedom\nAct in February, Senate Majority Leader McConnell said\nhe had provided assurances to supporters of the\nMarketplace Fairness Act “that we’ll have an opportunity\nto consider that sometime this year.” Since that is not\nlikely to occur during the lame-duck session, the issue is\nsure to resurface in 2017.\nIn September, the House approved by voice vote the\nMobile Workforce State Income Tax Simplification Act\n(H.R. 2315), to prohibit wages earned by an employee\nwho performs employment duties in more than one state\nfrom being subject to income tax in any state other than:\n(1) the state of the employee’s residence, and (2) the\nstate within which the employee is present and\nperforming employment duties for more than 30 days\nduring the calendar year. Senate Finance Committee\nmember John Thune (R-SD) sponsors a Senate version of\nthe bill (S. 386), though the outlook for the issue is\nunclear.\n16\n| Election 2016\nHealth\nWith a Trump win and Republicans maintaining control of\nthe House and Senate, the health agenda promises to be\none of the greatest policy areas of change in the next\nCongress.\nACA Repeal/Replace. In January, following a 240-181\nvote, the House sent to the President H.R. 3762,\nRestoring Americans’ Healthcare Freedom Reconciliation\nAct – a piece of legislation which dismantled key\nprovisions of the Affordable Care Act (ACA). The same\nlegislation was approved in the Senate on a vote of 52 to\n47. Although the President ultimately vetoed the\nlegislation, it represents a blueprint for Congressional\naction in 2017 to repeal core components of the ACA.\nThe reconciliation process allows leaders to call up\nlegislation and pass it with a simple majority vote in the\nSenate—avoiding a potential filibuster. Reconciliation\nrules in the Senate are complex, enforced by the Senate\nParliamentarian, and constrained by CBO scoring rules\nand conventions – which combine to determine what can\nand cannot be included in a reconciliation bill.\nReconciliation is a powerful tool but its use is limited to\npolicy changes that have a direct impact on taxing or\nspending levels. Because they have used this process\nbefore, Republicans have a road map of the changes that\nwill be possible through the use of reconciliation in a\nclosely divided Senate. Find a link to a summary of the\nReconciliation bill that passed in 2015 here. Donald\nTrump has been less prescriptive in terms of the specifics\nof the ACA replace plan that he supports. But generally,\nhe has called for a special session of Congress to\ncompletely repeal the ACA and replace it with a plan that\nallows consumers to buy insurance across state lines,\nallow individuals to deduct the cost of health care on their\nfederal tax returns, expand Health Savings Accounts\n(HSAs) and block grant Medicaid. Speaker Paul Ryan and\nthe House GOP introduced a proposal to replace the ACA\nthat can be found here. Because the Senate GOP did not\nintroduce their own ACA replace plan, negotiations\nbetween the chambers will be required before a strategy\nis developed.\nUser Fee Legislation. The Senate HELP Committee and\nthe House Energy and Commerce Committee are tasked\nwith the reauthorization of the Prescription Drug User Fee\nAct (PDUFA), the Generic Drug User Fee Act (GDUFA), the\nBiosimiliar User Fee Act (BsUFA), the Medical Device User\nFee and Modernization Act (MDUFMA). These programs\nmust be reauthorized in 2017 to ensure that sufficient\nindustry fees are available for the FDA to continue to\nconsider the applications of drugs and devices.\nThe Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and relevant\nindustries have reached draft agreements on the user fee\nproposals. The proposals are historically bipartisan\npriorities and are expected to be approved by Congress\nnext year. Some of the drug pricing issues raised by\nDemocrats in 2016 could potentially become embroiled in\nthe FDA user fee legislation negotiations. Even though\nDonald Trump has voiced some populist concerns about\nthe increasing cost of prescription drugs, the risk of drug\npricing policy changes being enacted next year are less\nlikely given that Hillary Clinton did not win the White\nHouse and the GOP continues to control the House and\nSenate. But Democrats are likely to continue to highlight\nthe issue and seek policy changes to address it.\nMental Health/ Opioids. Currently, discussions are\nongoing to find a compromise that can be enacted on\nmental health legislation in the lame duck Congress and\npossible further action to address the opioid addiction\ncrisis that was such a big issue in so many election\ncampaigns. But disagreements over funding levels, gun\nissues and the privacy of medical records persist. It\nremains to be seen if negotiators can reach agreement on\nthese issues in the lame duck session of Congress or if the\nissue will be revisited in the next Congress.\nMACRA Oversight. Congressional oversight of the\nCenters for Medicare & Medicaid Services’ (CMS)\nimplementation of the Medicare Access and CHIP\nReauthorization Act of 2015 (MACRA) is expected to\ncontinue following several House and Senate hearings\nheld over the past several months and recent publication\nof a final rule on the matter.\nIn 2015 Congress passed MACRA which overhauls how\nMedicare pays for physician services. The legislation\nrepealed the Medicare physician sustainable growth rate\n(SGR) formula and instead moves to a new two-track\npayment system called the Quality Payment Program\n(QPP). The two tracks of the QPP seek to tie an increased\npercentage of physicians’ Medicare fee-for-service\npayments to outcomes through the Merit Based Incentive\nPayment System (MIPS) and also to encourage the\nadoption of alternative payment models (APMs).\nAt recent House and Senate hearings, members from\nboth parties expressed concern about MACRA’s potential\nadverse impact on smaller independent and rural\nphysician practices. While the final rule attempts to\naddress these concerns, it is expected that Congress will\ncontinue to utilize its oversight power to monitor\nimplementation.\n17\n| Election 2016\nHealth\nHealthcare Reauthorization Priorities. The Children’s\nHealth Insurance Plan (CHIP) will expire and needs to be\nreauthorized in 2017. CHIP is a federal and state\npartnership program which provides health coverage to\nan estimated 8.9 million low-income children. In 2015,\nPresident Obama signed the Medicare Access and CHIP\nReauthorization Act which extended CHIP for an\nadditional two years; without an extension of the program\nin 2017 the program will exhaust its funding and states\nwill be required to continue the children’s coverage\nthrough Medicaid until 2019, due to the ACA’s\nmaintenance of effort (MOE) provision unless the ACA is\nrepealed. The reauthorization process will create an\nopportunity to consider additional policy changes\nincluding changes to the CHIP and Medicaid programs.\nThe ACA also created a funding stream for community\nhealth centers. In 2015, a bipartisan vote in Congress\nextended the Community Health Center Fund by an\nadditional two years (FY 2016 and FY 2017). It is likely\nthat lawmakers will push to extend funding of community\nhealth centers into future years beyond 2017.\nChronic Care. In late October, Senate Finance Committee\nChairman Hatch and Ranking Member Wyden along with\nSenators Johnny Isakson (R–GA) and Mark Warner (D-VA),\nco-chairs of the Finance Committee Chronic Care Working\nGroup, released a discussion draft with proposals to\nimprove health outcomes for Medicare beneficiaries living\nwith chronic conditions. Potential Senate legislative\naction on the discussion draft is possible in the lame duck\nsession, but it is also possible the bill will be taken up in\nthe next Congress.\n18\n| Election 2016\nEnergy\nDonald Trump is widely expected to significantly depart\nfrom the priorities of the Obama Administration by\nfavoring development of additional conventional energy\nresources and attempting to put the brakes on new\nenvironmental initiatives. The GOP majorities in the\nHouse and Senate have a similar agenda and Democrats\nin Congress are expected to mobilize in opposition -- in\nparticular by leveraging their power in the Senate to\nfilibuster legislation – and publicly highlight the potential\nimpacts of a Trump administration’s policies.\nTrump has pledged to cancel US participation in the 2015\nParis Climate agreement, and opposes implementation of\nthe Obama Administration’s Clean Power Plan (CPP). His\ncampaign literature is heavily salted with proposals to\nprovide regulatory relief to fossil fuel industries and\nslanted in favor of new administrative initiatives to foster\nconventional energy development. Specifically, his\nwebsite calls for the following energy-related initiatives:\n► Make America energy independent, create millions of\nnew jobs, and protect clean air and clean water;\nconserve our natural habitats, reserves and resources;\nunleash an energy revolution that will bring vast new\nwealth to our country.\n► Declare American energy dominance a strategic\neconomic and foreign policy goal of the United\nStates.\n► Unleash America’s $50 trillion in untapped shale, oil,\nand natural gas reserves, plus hundreds of years in\nclean coal reserves.\n► Become, and stay, totally independent of any need to\nimport energy from the OPEC cartel or any nations\nhostile to our interests.\n► Open onshore and offshore leasing on federal lands,\neliminate moratorium on coal leasing, and open shale\nenergy deposits.\n► Encourage the use of natural gas and other American\nenergy resources that will both reduce emissions but\nalso reduce the price of energy and increase our\neconomic output.\n► Rescind all job-destroying Obama executive actions.\nMr. Trump will reduce and eliminate all barriers to\nresponsible energy production, creating at least a half\nmillion jobs a year, $30 billion in higher wages, and\ncheaper energy.\nGiven the predominance of oil and gas executives\namongst his kitchen cabinet, it is also widely expected\nthat President-elect Trump will try to halt additional\nenvironmental regulatory measures proposed by the\nObama Administration, such as methane emission\ncurbs. It should be noted that it is difficult legally to\nchange or repeal regulations which have been\npromulgated in final form – such as the CPP – without\ngoing through the Administrative Procedures Act\nprocess. Environmental lawyers can be expected to\nlitigate at every step of the way if Trump attempts to\nbypass Congress and eliminate the CPP by Executive\nOrder, and the courts may well serve as a brake on such\nactions. However, environmental advocates who would\nhave likely tried to push a President Clinton to\nadministratively expand the scope of the CPP’s carbon\nemission regulations beyond the electric power sector,\npotentially economy-wide under Section 115 of the Clean\nAir Act, may now be left to using a litigation route to try\nto force the Environmental Protection Agency to expand\nthe CPP to achieve this goal.\nDuring the campaign, Trump also specifically rejected the\nidea of using a carbon tax/carbon pricing as a means of\nencouraging market-driven emission reductions. With\nGOP chairmen of the tax-writing committees in the House\nand Senate, it is very unlikely that they will schedule\nhearings or markups to move carbon taxes – other than to\nschedule votes in the House or Senate aimed at\nundermining vulnerable Democrats up for reelection in\n2018.\nAdditionally, the President-elect has vowed to allow\nenergy infrastructure projects, like the Keystone Pipeline\nand other industrial facilities which have faced denials or\ndelays under the current Administration, to move\nforward. Trump has proposed a $1 trillion infrastructure\nplan that would rely heavily on private-public partnerships\nby providing a tax credit to encourage private investors to\nfund projects overseen by states and municipalities. As\nconceived by Trump’s advisors, the tax credit would apply\nto infrastructure projects with a dedicated source of\nrevenue, such as toll roads, airports or utilities financed\nat least in part by fees paid by users. Decisions on which\nprojects to fund would generally be left to the states.\n19\n| Election 2016\nEnergy\nTrump’s tax reform plans generally adhere to the\nprecepts of the House Republican tax reform Blueprint,\nbut he differs with that outline in some important\nrespects. The House Blueprint proposes, among other\nthings, to allow 100% expensing of qualified business\ninvestments and to deny the deductibility of net business\ninterest expenses. It would also eliminate most fossil fuelspecific\ntax incentives such as deductions for intangible\ndrilling costs (IDCs) and percentage depletion, but its\nproposal to allow expensing of all business investment\nwould mitigate the loss of many of the specific\ndeductions. The Blueprint appears to allow both\nindependent and integrated producers to deduct 100% of\nIDCs in the year they are paid or incurred. While this\nwould preserve the status quo for independent producers,\nallowing integrated oil and gas companies to also expense\n100% of IDCs could increase the rate of return on oil and\ngas wells drilled by integrated companies. This change, in\ncombination with the possible loss of the percentage\ndepletion deduction (which allows cost recovery in excess\nof cost basis) could ultimately make independent\nproducers less competitive with integrated companies.\nTrump offered qualified support for the Blueprint’s\nproposal to allow 100% expensing – but would limit the\nprovision to manufacturers – and those who elect\nexpensing will lose the deductibility of business interest\nexpenses. Further, he may be more inclined to keep\ntraditional fossil fuel-specific tax incentives, such as the\ndeduction for intangible drilling costs and the percentage\ndepletion deduction.\nWhile President-elect Trump has spent much of his time\ndiscussing federal policy issues surrounding conventional\nenergy resources, he has expressed opposition to\ncontinued federal support for the development of wind\nand solar energy and has said that he will eliminate all\nfederal spending for clean energy research. How he\nproceeds in the new Congress may be heavily influenced\nby both electoral politics (e.g., ethanol-rich Iowa largely\nsupported his candidacy) and the pre-existing dynamics in\nCongress. Many congressional Republicans have opposed\neven temporary extensions of renewable energy\nincentives and the fate of these provisions may well be\nlinked to the effectiveness of the Democratic minority.\n20\n| Election 2016\nFinancial Services\nRepublicans’ retention of the House and Senate majorities\nmeans that President-elect Trump will have partners in\nboth banking committees to help implement an agenda\nheavy on deregulation. The new Senate Banking\nCommittee chairman will be Mike Crapo (R-ID), who has a\nsolid working relationship with returning Ranking Member\nSherrod Brown (D-OH) and could work productively with\nhim in a handful of areas. On the House side, Rep. Jeb\nHensarling (R-TX) returns as chairman of the Financial\nServices Committee. A fierce opponent of the 2010\nDodd-Frank Act, Hensarling will have Trump’s support in\nrenewing his effort to repeal and replace the Dodd-Frank\nAct and continuing the panel’s aggressive oversight of\nfinancial regulators. Given Republicans’ narrow majority\nin the Senate, Democrats’ ability to filibuster\ncontroversial bills in that chamber will make it difficult for\nHouse and Senate GOP leaders to push through a broad\ndismantling of major elements of Dodd-Frank, something\nthe President-elect called for during the campaign. But\ngiven that Republicans will have full control of the\nexecutive and legislative branches for the first time since\n2006, the GOP base will be dismayed if they don’t try\nanyway. Short of that broader effort, bipartisan\ncompromises in the areas of bank capital and regulatory\nrelief for smaller banks seem achievable.\nSenate Banking Committee. Crapo is widely seen as\nworking constructively with Sen. Brown – a stark contrast\nto Brown’s relationship with current Chairman Richard\nShelby (R-AL), who has been unable to agree with\nDemocrats on much legislatively. In a July interview,\nCrapo called Brown “straightforward and honorable” and\nsaid that while they were far apart in terms of their\npolitical views, “the fact is we have been able to find\nsignificant areas of consensus where we can agree to\nmove forward on good policy, so I expect that we would\nbe able to do that.” The leading options for an early\nbipartisan effort include a bill providing regulatory relief\nfrom some Dodd-Frank provisions to community banks, a\nhigh priority for both Crapo and Brown. Such a bill might\ninclude language raising Dodd-Frank’s $50 billion asset\nthreshold, above which banks must submit to more\nrigorous prudential supervision by the Fed. Crapo and\nBrown also could agree on modest structural changes to\nthe Federal Reserve, unless pressure from the Trump\nWhite House for a more ambitious Fed reform bill – like\nthe package of changes passed by the House in November\n2015 – derails that effort. Crapo and Brown could also\nconceivably agree on more stringent capital standards for\nthe largest banks, a theme that Brown hammers at every\nopportunity.\nAs Shelby did, Crapo is expected to maintain the\ncommittee’s focus on rules and bodies created by the\nDodd-Frank Act, such as the Financial Stability Oversight\nCouncil (FSOC) and the Consumer Financial Protection\nBureau (CFPB), which suffered a judicial setback when a\nfederal appeals court on October 11 ruled that its\nstructure was unconstitutional. Crapo has also been\nskeptical of the new supervisory authorities the 2010 law\ngave the Fed to oversee larger banks and insurers that\nare designated as systemically important by the FSOC.\nCrapo could work collaboratively with Ranking Member\nBrown on a legislative follow-up to the Fed’s recent report\ncriticizing banks’ trading of physical commodities; one\nobvious possibility is to repeal the merchant banking\nexemption given to the holding companies for Goldman\nSachs and Morgan Stanley, as the Fed recommended.\nFinally, a post-crisis system for housing finance – i.e., the\nfuture of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac – still looms as the\nbiggest area left unaddressed by the 2010 financial\nreforms, but a bipartisan effort to establish a new system\ndrafted by Crapo and then-Chairman Tim Johnson (R-SD)\nin 2013-14 foundered when the Banking Committee’s\nliberal Democrats (and some Republicans) declined to\nsupport the centrist proposal. Since then, few signs have\nemerged about how to structure a new housing finance\nsystem in a way that could survive a Senate filibuster, and\nPresident-elect Trump did not address the issue during his\ncampaign.\nHouse Financial Services Committee. After years of\nconfrontation with a Democratic White House and\nDemocratic appointees to financial regulators, Chairman\nHensarling will shift strategies now that the executive\nbranch is in more friendly hands. Hensarling is not likely\nto improve his contentious relationship with Rep. Maxine\nWaters (D-CA), however, who will return as ranking\nmember and is certain to push back on Hensarling’s\nefforts to replace the 2010 reforms with more\nconservative approaches. While Hensarling has regularly\ndone battle with officials at the FSOC, Treasury, SEC and\nthe Fed, new leadership is expected at those agencies –\nthough even Republican appointees will be constrained by\nthe existing statutory mandates in Dodd-Frank, unless the\nnew Congress is able to alter the law with legislation. At\nthe Fed, Chairman Janet Yellen’s term does not expire\nuntil January 2018. President-elect Trump frequently\ncriticized Yellen as being overly “political” during the\ncampaign.\n21\n| Election 2016\nFinancial Services\nDuring the four previous years of Hensarling’s\nchairmanship, most of the committee’s major bills died\nquietly in the Senate, such as efforts to repeal much of\nDodd-Frank (the CHOICE Act), impose substantial reforms\nupon the Fed, restructure the CFPB and strip the FSOC of\nvarious powers. That may change now that the House,\nSenate and White House will operate with greater\ncoordination, though the threat of the Senate filibuster\nlimits what Republicans can achieve. Hensarling notably\nhas enjoyed a longtime friendship with Vice Presidentelect\nMike Pence, which will give him a powerful ally in the\nWhite House as the new administration plots its strategy\nfor financial regulation and nominates key appointees for\nthe regulatory agencies. Hensarling agrees with Senators\nCrapo and Brown on the importance of capital for big\nbanks, but he wants to reward banks with relief from\nmuch of Dodd-Frank’s supervisory regime if they agree to\na higher leverage ratio. Hensarling can be expected to\nreintroduce his CHOICE Act and Rep. Bill Huizenga’s (R-\nMI) package of Fed reforms (the FORM Act), and to renew\nthe panel’s aggressive oversight of the CFPB, the FSOC\nand other bodies established by Dodd-Frank. Republicans\nhave also been critical of moves by global regulatory\nbodies to set capital and liquidity rules for “systemically\nimportant” banks and insurance companies.\nWells Fargo Scandal. Lawmakers in both the House and\nSenate are certain to resume their investigations of Wells\nFargo in the wake of revelations that the bank’s\nemployees created as many as 2 million accounts without\ncustomers’ consent. Hensarling and other Republicans\nwant to use the scandal to raise questions about the\nperformance of the CFPB and the Office of the\nComptroller of the Currency (OCC), while Ranking\nMember Waters has vowed to offer a bill breaking up\nWells Fargo into smaller companies. On the Senate side,\nRanking Member Brown has used the scandal to focus on\nmandatory arbitration provisions in financial contracts,\nand will likely propose legislation prohibiting such clauses,\nthough Sen. Crapo is unlikely to support him. In an\neditorial piece in October, Camden Fine, president of the\nIndependent Community Bankers of America (ICBA),\nwrote that he “fully expected” that Wells Fargo’s new\npolicy of notifying customers whenever a new account is\ncreated in their name, along with “far more stringent\npolicies, will ultimately become mandatory as\npolicymakers respond to the scandal with additional\nregulatory burdens on banks of all sizes.”\nOversight of Regulators. As they have in previous years,\nthe banking committees in 2017 will devote considerable\ntime to overseeing rules issued by financial regulators.\nThese will include the still-unfinished interagency rules for\nclawing back incentive compensation drafted by the SEC,\nthe Fed, the FDIC and other agencies; the CFPB’s\ncontroversial new rules for prepaid cards, payday lenders\nand mandatory arbitration clauses; the global Financial\nStability Board’s forthcoming regulations for capital held\nby large insurers; and the international Basel Committee’s\nrules for bank capital, which are expected to be issued by\nthe end of this year. The Banking Committee must also\nschedule hearings for high-level Treasury nominees, as\nwell as nominees for key vacancies at the SEC, CFTC, the\nFederal Reserve and the Ex-Im Bank, which were never\nfilled in the current Congress because of lingering\ndisputes with the Obama administration.\nTwo Deadlines to Watch: 1) the largest banks resubmit\ntheir “living will” resolution plans in May 2017, always a\nsource of contention for critics of “too big to fail”; 2) the\nTerrorism Risk Insurance Act (TRIA) expires at the end of\n2017, forcing yet another ideological dispute over\nwhether the federal backstop program should be\nrenewed.\n22\n| Election 2016\nTrade\nTrade legislative issues could figure prominently in 2017.\nDuring the campaign, President-elect Trump argued\nvigorously against the proposed Trans-Pacific Partnership\n(TPP), vowed to renegotiate the North American Free\nTrade Agreement (NAFTA) and pledged to label China as\na currency manipulator, which could trigger the\nimposition of significant tariffs on Chinese imports.\nSenate Finance Committee. President-elect Trump may\nfind himself somewhat at odds on his trade agenda with\nSenate Finance Committee Chairman Hatch who has\nsupported numerous trade agreements during his\ncongressional tenure.\nHouse Ways and Means Committee. House Republican\ntrade leaders – including Speaker Ryan and Ways and\nMeans Chairman Brady – played a pivotal role in\nadvancing President Obama’s trade initiatives through\nCongress, including passage of Trade Promotion\nAuthority (TPA) in 2015. A key question is how closely\nthey will work to support President-elect Trump’s trade\nrestrictionist agenda.\nTrans-Pacific Partnership Agreement. Unless TPP can\nbe approved in the 2016 lame-duck session (an extremely\nunlikely prospect, as discussed above), TPP will not be\nratified.\nTransatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership\nAgreement. US and EU trade negotiators failed to make\nmuch meaningful progress on TTIP in 2016. Prospects for\nTTIP are dim, given the President-elect’s trade priorities\nand a potential chill in US-EU relations.\nOther trade agreements? The Trade Promotion\nAuthority, enacted in 2015, provides enhanced fast-track\nprocedures for trade agreements reached before July 1,\n2018, with a possible extension to July 1, 2021. Will\nPresident-elect Trump decide to launch additional trade\nagreements that could be considered under the fast-track\nauthority in Congress? Following the U.K. vote on Brexit\nthis summer, some Members of Congress expressed an\ninterest in a possible US-U.K. free trade agreement.\n23\n| Election 2016\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

Dynamical systems in geometric space become symbolic\ndynamics in sequence space. It was Kolmogoroff (1958) who first applied\nShannon’s ideas of entropy and information (Shannon and Weaver, 1949; Khinchin,\n1957) to the quantification of these dynamical system’s telegraphic messages as\n\ndiscrete, “stochastic” (random, probabilistic) output. Kolmogoroff turned to Shannon\n\nentropy, -S'p, log p, (where p = 1/n and n = number of possibilities) to decide the\n\nquestion whether a dynamical system that naturally partitioned into a two or three\nbox system per unit time had the same entropy. His answer was no, that —3(1/3 In\n(1/3)) = 1.098 > -2(1/2 In (1/2) = 0.6931 loge and in computer relevant logz, 1.5850 >\n1.0 (Kolmogorov, 1959).

It was the symbols in those squares that encoded the\nmachine of which they were a part. During the machine’s reproduction, the “tape” could\nmove either left or right and was both interpreted (transcribed) as the instructions\n(translation) for the new “machine” being built and then copied (replicated)—with the\nnew copy being placed inside the new machine for further reproduction. Francis Crick\nand James Watson later showed, in 1953, how such a tape could be instantiated in\nbiology by along DNA molecule with its finite alphabet of four nucleobases: guanine,\ncytosine, adenine, and thymine (G, C, A, and T).'* Asin von Neumann’s machine, in\nbiological reproduction the linear sequence of symbols in DNA is interpreted—through\ntranscription into RNA molecules, which then are translated into proteins, the structures\nthat make up a new cell—and the DNA is replicated and encased in the new cell.\n\nA second foundational piece of work was in a 1945 “First Draft” report on the\ndesign for a digital computer, wherein von Neumann advocated for a memory that could\ncontain both instructions and data.'4 This is now known as a von Neumann architecture\ncomputer—as distinct from a Harvard architecture computer, where there are two\nseparate memories, one for instructions and one for data. The vast majority of computer\nchips built in the era of Moore’s Law are based on the von Neumann architecture,\nincluding those powering our data centers, our laptops, and our smartphones. Von\nNeumann’s digital-computer architecture 1s conceptually the same generalization—from\nearly digital computers constructed with electromagnetic relays at both Harvard\nUniversity and Bletchley Park—that occurs in going from a special-purpose Turing\nMachine to a Universal Turing Machine. Furthermore, his self-replicating automata\nshare a fundamental similarity with both the construction of a Turing Machine and the\nmechanism of DNA-based reproducing biological cells. There is to this day scholarly\ndebate over whether von Neumann saw the cross connections between these three pieces\nof work, Turing’s and his two. Turing’s revision of his paper was done while he and von\nNeumann were both at Princeton; indeed, after getting his PhD, Turing almost stayed on\nas von Neumann’s postdoc.\n\nWithout Turing and von Neumann, the cybernetics of Wiener might have\nremained a dominant mode of thought and driver of technology for much longer than its\nbrief moment of supremacy. In this imaginary version of history, we might well live\ntoday in an actual steam-punk world and not just get to observe its fantastical\ninstantiations at Maker Faires!\n\nMy point is that Wiener thought about the world—physical, biological, and (in\nHuman Use) sociological—in a particular way. He analyzed the world as continuous\nvariables, as he explains in chapter 1 along with a nod to thermodynamics through an\noverlay of Gibbs statistics. He also shoehorns in a weak and unconvincing model of\ninformation as message-passing between and among both physical and biological entities.\nTo me, and from today’s vantage point seventy years on, his tools seem woefully\n\n13“ Structure for Deoxyribose Nucleic Acid,” Nature 171, 737-738 (1953).\n\n14 hitps://en.wikipedia.org//wiki/First_Draft_of_a_Report_on_ the EDVAC#Controversy.

From our earliest days,\nthere was an understanding that you used whatever force necessary in order to\nmake an operation successful. Yet once the aim had been achieved — in this case,\neliminating the danger to the passengers — it was over. I am convinced, by the\nway, that Misha didn’t actually order the sayeret, or anyone else, to kill all the\nterrorists. I’m equally convinced there was a tacit assumption on the ground that\nMisha’s view, and Shamir’s as well, was that this would be no bad thing.\n\nYet by the summer of 1984, Shamir and Arens appeared in danger of losing\ntheir jobs. Israel’s next election, the first since the Lebanon war, was due in\nJuly. Just as the trauma of the 1973 war had helped Begin end Likud’s three\ndecades in opposition, the polls and the pundits were now suggesting that\nShimon Peres might bring Labor back to power. There was no prospect he’d\nwin an outright majority in the 120-seat Knesset. No one had ever done that, not\neven Ben-Gurion in his political heyday. From 1948, Israel’s political landscape\nhad been populated by at least a dozen-or-so parties, mostly a reflection of the\nvarious Zionist and religious groups before the state was established. The\ndominant party always needed to make deals with some of the smaller ones to\nget the required 60-vote parliamentary majority and form a government.\n\nThe Likud looked vulnerable. Domestic concerns, alone, were eroding its\nsupport. Under Begin’s turbo-charged version of Milton Freedman economics,\nan economic boom had given way to runaway inflation and a stock market\ncrash. Lebanon, however, was the main issue, and it remained a running\npolitical sore. The assassinated Bashir Gemayel’s brother, Amin Gemayel, had\nbecome president. But Israel still had large numbers of troops there. And while\nmost of the PLO fighters had gone, we faced a new and potentially even more\nintractable enemy in the south of the country. When our invasion began, the\narea’s historically disadvantaged Shi’ite Muslim majority had been the one\ngroup besides the Christians with the prospect of benefiting. The PLO rocket\nand artillery bases had disrupted their lives and, worse, placed them in the line\n\n215\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_028063\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

To distinguish hostile aircraft, one of the things you need, besides a\nnetwork of computers and early-warning radar sites, is a map of all commercial air\ntraffic, updated in real time. The United States built such a system and named it SAGE\n(Semi-Automatic Ground Environment). SAGE in turn spawned Sabre, the first\nintegrated reservation system for booking airline travel in real time. Sabre and its\nprogeny soon became not just a map as to what seats were available but also a system\nthat began to control, with decentralized intelligence, where airliners would fly, and\nwhen.\n\nBut isn’t there a control room somewhere, with someone at the controls? Maybe\nnot. Say, for example, you build a system to map highway traffic in real time, simply by\ngiving cars access to the map in exchange for reporting their own speed and location at\nthe time. The result is a fully decentralized control system. Nowhere is there any\ncontrolling model of the system except the system itself.\n\nImagine it is the first decade of the 21st century and you want to track the\ncomplexity of human relationships in real time. For social life at a small college, you\ncould construct a central database and keep it up to date, but its upkeep would become\noverwhelming if taken to any larger scale. Better to pass out free copies of a simple\nsemi-autonomous code, hosted locally, and let the social network update itself. This code\nis executed by digital computers, but the analog computing performed by the system as a\nwhole far exceeds the complexity of the underlying code. The resulting pulse-frequency\ncoded model of the social graph becomes the social graph. It spreads wildly across the\ncampus and then the world.\n\nWhat if you wanted to build a machine to capture what everything known to the\nhuman species means? With Moore’s Law behind you, it doesn’t take too long to digitize\nall the information in the world. You scan every book ever printed, collect every email\never written, and gather forty-nine years of video every twenty-four hours, while tracking\nwhere people are and what they do, in real time. But how do you capture the meaning?\n\nEven in the age of all things digital, this cannot be defined in any strictly logical\nsense, because meaning, among humans, isn’t fundamentally logical. The best you can\ndo, once you have collected all possible answers, is to invite well-defined questions and\ncompile a pulse-frequency weighted map of how everything connects. Before you know\nit, your system will not only be observing and mapping the meaning of things, it will start\nconstructing meaning as well. In time, it will control meaning, in the same way as the\ntraffic map starts to control the flow of traffic even though no one seems to be in control.\n\nThere are three laws of artificial intelligence. The first, known as Ashby’s Law, after\ncybernetician W. Ross Ashby, author of Design for a Brain, states that any effective\ncontrol system must be as complex as the system it controls.\n\nThe second law, articulated by John von Neumann, states that the defining\ncharacteristic of a complex system is that it constitutes its own simplest behavioral\ndescription.

I looked up the statistics, black kids in the US have slower cognitive development (and never catch\nup), which the study of course attributed to social factors without any evidence, and they had faster motor\ndevelopment! I suspect this means their brains are slower at learning high-level concepts, because the low-\nlevel structures are optimized for a shorter time. But they will keep the lead in motor development, because it\nis easier to learn, and they have more time and attention to practice once they get the structures in place.\n\nIt could also be that they have an additional set of learning directives in place that adapts them better to a\nmore hunting/running style of life, whereas the Europeans had to adapt for identifying long-term seasonal\npatterns, delayed gratification for agriculture etc.\n\nand CONCEPTS could be layer to layer communicaiton. . are gender differences also a matter of time ,\nand structure of interactions. .\n\nI suspect gender differences are mostly motivational, i.e. we have a reward system for all the different social\nand cognitive needs, which makes us receive different kinds of pleasure and pain, thereby pay attention and\nlearn. You cannot learn what does not attract your attention. Women tend to find abstract systems, conflicts\nand mechanisms intrinsically boring. Most women in computer science do not write programs because they\nenjoy solving puzzles, but because they want to help people, get approval etc. There are almost no women in\nmath, because it does not help people or yield social attention.\n\nMen tend to find elaborate social relations boring. If there is no pleasure in observing and empathizing with\npeople, one will not have good social cognition.\n\n1Q is not the only meaningful difference. Chinese pay an inordinate amount of attention to authority. I\nsuspect historically., the authorities tended to kill them a lot if they did not. Jews tend be intellectually\nindependent and anti-authoritarian, which might make them creative and inventive in ways that are hard to\nfind in Asia.\n\nAt the moment, I think speed/quality of brain development plus motivational system are the key to\nunderstanding both mind and individual differences. Important part of human language might be the result in\na motivational need to discover/invent grammatical structure, which as a side effect makes us interested in\nmusic.\n\nIt would mean that Chomsky’s life long hypothesis, that people have a special circuit for grammatical\nlanguage, is wrong. They might be GENERAL learners, just like Gorillas, but with a strong motivational\nurge to build grammatical structure, which the brain simply invents (there are only a few ways in which a\nnatural language can work). That is much easier to wire into a brain than a specific circuit.\n\nimy self believe that african music, westrn music , chinese music are a window into the the structure of\nthose layers. . western rigid, african primitve , chinese nature based,. I belive that synphoic movments\nbest describe your layering. they open with a basic simple melody, , after it is learned , it is repeated and\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_026407\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

A cohort means the set of all same-aged individuals. It turns out that the\nratio of females to males tends to rise with each older cohort, for reasons Bob\nTrivers explains, as does wealth up to a point. But in cohort analysis, both effects\n(wealth and sex ratio) are incorporated into effects of cohort age. That will simplify\n\nmodeling.\n\nMy risk theory is another example of what looks to be surprise and novelty until\nshown otherwise. The unusual idea lies in projecting the owner’s time\npreference/return rate onto the asset rather than conversely. Thus all the owner’s\nassets of both factors are selected or modified to fit her current risk profile. This\nwould count her liquid securities portfolio, cap weighted, as a single asset. All other\nassets are too illiquid for practical rebalancing. We own the assets best suited to our\nrisk profiles, if for no better reason than that we wouldn’t be the winning bidders\nfor any others if we wanted them. As our risk profiles evolve with age, we modify or\ntrade them. We will tend to have anticipated this need, and to have factored\nmodification or trading costs into our bid price. It turns out that this interpretation\n\ncan simplify the math of present value and present cost.\n\nIt helps in supporting the pay rule, and explaining age-wage profiles, by rebutting a\nhypothesis, sometimes argued, that productivity of human capital might rise with\nage. Productivity, rate of return and time preference rate all mean the same. My risk\ntheory argues that we knowa cohort’s risk tolerance from the return to its cap-\nweighted securities portfolio as a whole. All other assets of the same cohort,\nincluding human capital, will tend to agree with it in return. Return to security\nportfolios tends to be transparent. It declines with adult cohort age. | infer that\n\nreturn to human capital does the same.\n\nMy risk theory and depreciation theory together add a finishing touch to the pay\nrule. The key supporting evidence is age-wage profiles.

Thus, while neither \nof us has previously made such a request, we do so now in the recognition that both the \nDepartment's reputation, as well as the due process rights of our client, are at issue. \nRecently, the Criminal Division concluded a very limited review of this matter at the \nrequest of U.S. Attorney Alex Acosta. Critically, however, this review deliberately excluded \nmany important aspects of this case. Just this past Friday, on May 16, 2008, we received a letter \nfrom the head of CEOS informing us that CEOS had conducted a review of this case. By its own \nadmission, the CEOS review was \"limited, both factually and legally.\" Part of the self-imposed \nlimitation was CEOS's abstention from addressing our \"allegations of professional misconduct \nby federal prosecutors\"—even though such misconduct was, as we contend it is, inextricably \nintertwined with the credibility of the accusations being made against Mr. Epstein by the United \nStates Attorney's Office in Miami (\"USAO\"). Moreover, CEOS did not assess the terms of the \nDeferred Prosecution Agreement now in effect, nor did CEOS review the federal prosecutors' \ninappropriate efforts to implement those terms. We detail this point below. \nA001438 \n\fHonorable Mark Filip \nMay 19, 2008 \nPage 2 \nBy way of background, we were informed by Mr. Acosta that, at his request, CEOS \nwould be conducting a review to determine whether federal prosecution was both appropriate \nand, in his words, \"fair.\" That is not what occurred. Instead, CEOS has now acknowledged that \nwe had raised \"many compelling argtunents\" against the USAO's suggested \"novel application\" \nof federal law in this matter. Even so, CEOS concluded, in minimalist fashion, that \"we do not \nsee anything that says to us categorically that a federal case should not be brought\" and that the \nU.S. Attorney \"would not be abusing his prosecutorial discretion should he authorize federal \nprosecution of Mr. Epstein\" thus delegating back to Mr. Acosta the decision of whether federal \nprosecution was warranted (emphasis added). Rather than assessing whether prosecution would \nbe appropriate, CEOS, using a low baseline for its evaluation, determined only that \"it would not \nbe impossible to prove . . .\" certain allegations made against Mr. Epstein. The CEOS review \nfailed to address the significant problems involving the appearance of impermissible selectivity \nthat would necessarily result from a federal prosecution of Mr. Epstein. \nWe respect CEOS's conclusion that its authority to review \"misconduct\" issues was \nprecluded by Criminal Division practice. We further respect CEOS's view that it understood its \nmission as significantly limited. Specifically, the contemplated objective was to determine \nwhether the USAO would be abusing its discretion by bringing a federal prosecution rather than \nmaking its own de novo recommendations on the appropriate reach of federal law. However, we \nrespectfully submit that a full review of all the facts is urgently needed at senior levels of the \nJustice Department. In an effort to inform you of the nature of the federal investigation against \nMr. Epstein, we summarize the facts and circumstances of this matter below. \nThe two base-level concerns we hold are that (1) federal prosecution of this matter is not \nwarranted based on the purely-local conduct and the unprecedented application of federal \nstatutes to facts such as these and (2) the actions of federal authorities are both highly \nquestionable and give rise to an appearance of substantial impropriety. The issues that we have \nraised, but which have not yet been addressed or resolved by the Department, are more than \nisolated allegations of professional mistakes or misconduct. These issues, instead, affect the \nappearance and administration of criminal justice with profound consequences beyond the \nresolution in the matter at hand. \nIn a precedent-shattering investigation of Jeffrey Epstein that raises important policy \nquestions—and serious issues as to the fair and honorable enforcement of federal law—the \nUSAO in Miami is considering extending federal law beyond the bounds of precedent and \nreason. Federal prosecutors stretched the underlying facts in ways that raise fundamental \nquestions of basic professionalism. Perhaps most troubling, the USA() in Miami, as a condition \nof deferring prosecution, required a commingling of substantive federal criminal law with a \nproposed civil remedy engineered in a way that appears intended to profit particular lawyers in \nA001439 \n\fHonorable Mark Filip \nMay 19, 2008 \nPage 3 \nprivate practice in South Florida with personal relationships to some of the prosecutors involved. \nFederal prosecutors then leaked highly sensitive information about the case to a New York \nTimes reporter.' The immediate result of this confluence of extraordinary circumstances is an \nonslaught of civil lawsuits, all save one brought by the First Assistant's former boutique law firm \nin Miami. \nThe facts in this case all revolve around the classic state crime of solicitation of \nprosiltution.2 The State Attorney's Office in Palm Beach County had conducted a diligent \ninvestigation, convened a Grand Jury that returned an indictment, and made a final determination \nabout how to proceed. That is where, in our federal republic, this matter should rest. \nMr. Epstein faces a felony conviction in state court by virtue of his conduct, and the only reason \nthe State has not resolved this matter is that the federal prosecutors in Miami have continued to \ninsist that we, Mr. Epstein's counsel, approach and demand from the State Attorney's Office a \nharsher charge and a more severe punishment than that Office believes are appropriate under the \ncircumstances. Yet despite the USAO's refusal to allow the State to resolve this matter on the \nterms the State has determined are appropriate, the USAO has not made any attempt to \ncoordinate its efforts with the State. In fact, the USA° mandated that any federal agreement \nwould be conditioned on Mr. Epstein persuading the State to seek a criminal punishment unlike \nthat imposed on other defendants within the jurisdiction of the State Attorney for similar \nconduct. \nFrom the inception of the USAO's involvement in this case, which at the end of the day \nis a case about solicitation of prostitution within the confines of Palm Beach County, Florida, we \nhave asked ourselves why the Department of Justice is involved. Regrettably, we are unable to \nsuggest any appropriate basis for the Department's involvement. Mr. Epstein has no criminal \nhistory whatsoever. Also, Mr. Epstein has never been the subject of general media interest until \na few years ago, after it was widely perceived by the public that he was a close friend of former \nPresident Bill Clinton. \nThe conduct at issue is simply not within the purview of federal jurisdiction and lies \noutside the heartland of the three federal statutes that have been identified by prosecutors-18 \nU.S.C. §§ 1591, 2422(b), and 2423(b). \nOne of the other members of Mr. Epstein's defense team, Jay Lefkowitz, has personally reviewed the reporter's \ncontemporaneous notes. \n2 Although some of the women alleged to be involved were 16 and 17 years of age, several of these women \nopenly admitted to lying to Mr. Epstein about their age in their recent sworn statements. \nA001440 \n\fHonorable Mark Filip \nMay 19, 2008 \nPage 4 \nThese statutes are intended to target crimes of a truly national and international scope. \nSpecifically, § 1591 was enacted to combat human trafficking, § 2422 is aimed at sexual \npredation of minors through the Internet, and § 2423 deals with sex tourism. The nature of these \ncrimes results in multi-jurisdictional problems that state and local authorities cannot effectively \nconfront on their own. However, Mr. Epstein's conduct was purely local in nature and, thus, \ndoes not implicate federal involvement. After researching every reported case brought under 18 \nU.S.C. §§ 1591, 2422(b), and 2423(b), we found that not a single case involves facts or a \nscenario similar to the situation at hand. Our review of each precedent reflects that there have \nbeen no reported prosecutions under § 1591 of a `john' whose conduct with a minor lacked \nforce, coercion, or fraud and who was not profiting from commercial sexual trafficking. There \nhave likewise been no cases under § 2422(b)—a crime of communication—where there was no \nuse of the Internet, and where the content of phone communications did not contain any inducing \nor enticing of a minor to have illegal sexual activity as expressly required by the language of the \nstatute. Furthermore, the Government's contention that \"routine and habit\" can fill the factual \nand legal void created by the lack of evidence that such a communication ever occurred sets this \ncase apart from every reported case brought under § 2422(b). Lastly, there are no reported cases \nof violations of § 2423(b) of a person whose dominant purpose in traveling was merely to go to \nhis own home.3 \nAlthough these matters were within the scope of the CEOS review, rather than \nconsidering whether federal prosecution is appropriate, CEOS only determined that U.S. \nAttorney Acosta \"would not be abusing his prosecutorial discretion should he authorize federal \nprosecution\" in this case. The \"abuse of discretion\" standard constitutes an extremely low bar of \nevaluation and while it may be appropriate when the consideration of issues are exclusively \nfactual in nature, this standard fails to address concerns particular to this situation, namely the \n\"novel application\" of federal statutes. The \"abuse of discretion\" standard in such pure legal \nmatters of statutory application risks causing a lack of uniformity. The same federal statutes that \nwould be stretched beyond their bounds in Miami have been limited to their heartland in each of \nthe other federal districts. Also, because this case implicates broader issues of the administration \nof equal justice, federal prosecution in this matter risks the appearance of selectiVity in its \nstretching of federal law to fit these facts. \n3 Federal prosecution of a man who engaged in consensual conduct in his home that amounted to, at most, the \nsolicitation of prostitution, is unprecedented. Since prostitution is fundamentally a state concern, (see United \nStates v. Evans, 476 F.3d 1176, n.1 (11th Cir. 2007) (federal law \"does not criminalize all acts of prostitution (a \nvice traditionally governed by state regulation)\")), and there is no evidence that Palm Beach County authorities \nand Florida prosecutors cannot effectively prosecute and punish the conduct, there is no reason why this matter \nshould be extracted from the hands of state prosecutors in Florida. \nA001441 \n\fHonorable Mark Filip \nMay 19, 2008 \nPage 5 \nIn fact, recent testimony of several alleged \"victims\" contradicts claims made by federal \nprosecutors during the negotiations of a deferred prosecution agreement. The consistent \nrepresentations of key Government witnesses (such as Tatum Miller, Brittany Beale, Saige \nGonzalez, and Jennifer Laduke) confirm the following critical points: First, there was no \ncommunication, telephonic or otherwise, that meets the requirements of § 2422(b). For instance, \nMs. Gonzalez confirmed that Mr. Epstein never emailed, text-messaged, or used any facility of \ninterstate commerce whatsoever, before or after her one (and only) visit to his home. Gonzalez \nTr. (deposition) at 30. Second, the women who testified admitted that they lied to Mr. Epstein \nabout their age in order to gain admittance into his home. Indeed, the women who brought their \nunderage friends to Mr. Epstein testified that they would counsel their friends to lie about their \nages as well. Ms. Miller stated the following: \"I would tell my girlfriends just like Carolyn \napproached me. Make sure you tell him you're 18. Well, these girls that I brought, I know that \nthey were 18 or 19 or 20. And the girls that! didn't know and I don't know if they were lying or \nnot, I would say make sure that you tell him you're 18.\" Miller Tr. at 22. Third, there was no \nroutine or habit of improper communication expressing an intent to transform a massage into an \nillegal sexual act. In fact, there was often no sexual activity at all during the massage. Ms. \nMiller testified that \"[s]ometimes [Mr. Epstein] just wanted his feet massaged. Sometimes he \njust wanted a back massage.\" Miller Tr. at 19. Jennifer Laduke also stated that Mr. Epstein \n\"never touched [her] physically\" and that all she did was \"massage[ ] his back, his chest and his \nthighs and that was it.\" Laduke Tr. at 12-13. Finally, there was no force, coercion, fraud, \nviolence, drugs, or even alcohol present in connection with Mr. Epstein's encounters with these \nwomen. Ms. Beale stated that \"[Mr. Epstein] never tried to force me to do anything.\" Beale Tr. \nA at 12. These accounts are far from the usual testimony in sex slavery, Internet stings and sex \ntourism cases previously brought. The women in actuality were not younger than 16, which is \nthe age of consent in most of the 50 states, and the sex activity was irregular and in large part, \nconsisted of solo self-pleasuring. \nThe recent crop of civil suits brought against Mr. Epstein confirm that the plaintiffs did \nnot discuss any sexually-related activities with anyone prior to arriving at Mr. Epstein's \nresidence. This reinforces our contention that no telephonic or Internet persuasion, inducement, \nenticement or coercion of a minor, or of any other individual, occurred. In addition, Mr. Jeffrey \nHeiman, the former law partner of one of the federal prosecutors involved in this matter and the \nattorney for most of the civil complainants (as described in detail below), was quoted in the Palm \nBeach Post as saying that \"it doesn't matter\" that his clients lied about their ages and told Mr. \nEpstein that they were 18 or 19. \nNot only is a federal prosecution of this matter unwarranted, but the irregularity of \nconduct by prosecutors and the unorthodox terms of the deferred prosecution agreement are \nbeyond any reasonable interpretation of the scope of a prosecutor's responsibilities. The list of \nimproprieties includes, but is not limited to, the following facts: \nA001442 \n\fHonorable Mark Filip \nMay 19, 2008 \nPage 6 \n• Federal prosecutors made the unprecedented demand that Mr. Epstein pay a \nminimum of $150,000 per person to an unnamed list of women they referred to as \nminors and whom they insisted required representation by a guardian ad litem. Mr. \nEpstein's counsel later established that all but one of these individuals were actually \nadults, not minors. Even then, though demanding payment to the women, the \nUSAO eventually asserted that it could not vouch for the veracity of any of the \nclaims that these women might make. \n• Federal prosecutors made the highly unusual demand that Mr. Epstein pay the fees \nof a civil attorney chosen by the prosecutors to represent these alleged \"victims\" \nshould they choose to bring any civil litigation against him. They also proposed \nsending a notice to the alleged \"victims,\" stating, in an underlined sentence, that \nshould they choose their own attorney, Mr. Epstein would not be required to pay \ntheir fees. The prosecutors further demanded that Mr. Epstein waive his right to \nchallenge any of the allegations made by these \"victims.\" \n• The Assistant U.S. Attorney involved in this matter recommended for the civil \nattorney, a highly lucrative position, an individual that we later discovered was \nclosely and personally connected to the Assistant U.S. Attorney's own boyfriend. \n• Federal prosecutors represented to Mr. Epstein's counsel that they had identified \n(and later rechecked and re-identified) several alleged \"victims\" of federal crimes \nthat qualified for payment under 18 U.S.C. § 2255, a civil remedy designed to \nprovide financial benefits to victims. Only through state discovery provisions did \nwe later learn that many of the women on the rechecked \"victim list\" could not \npossibly qualify under § 2255. The reason is that they, themselves, testified that \nthey did not suffer any type of harm whatsoever, a prerequisite for the civil recovery \nunder § 2255. Moreover, these women stated that they did not, now or in the past, \nconsider themselves to be victims. \n• During the last few months, Mr. Herman, First Assistant Sloman's former law \npartner, has filed several civil lawsuits against Mr. Epstein on behalf of the alleged \n\"victims.\" It is our understanding that each of Mx. Herman's clients are on the \nA001443 \n\fHonorable Mark Filip \nMay 19, 2008 \nPage 7 \nGovernment's confidential \"list of victims.\" Most of these lawsuits seek $50 \nmillion in money damages.4 \n• Assistant U.S. Attorney David Weinstein spoke about the case in great detail to \nLandon Thomas, a reporter with the New York Times, and revealed confidential \ninformation about the Government's allegations against Mr. Epstein. The Assistant \nU.S. Attorney also revealed the substance of confidential plea negotiations. \n• When counsel for Mr. Epstein complained about the media leaks, First Assistant \nSloman responded by asserting that \"Mr. Thomas was given, pursuant to his \nrequest, non-case specific information concerning specific federal statutes.\" Based \non Mr. Thomas' contemporaneous notes, that assertion appears to be false. For \nexample, Mr. Weinstein told Mr. Thomas that federal authorities believed that \nMr. Epstein had lured girls over the telephone and traveled in interstate commerce \nfor the purpose of engaging in underage sex. He recounted to Mr. Thomas the \nUSAO's theory of prosecution against Mr. Epstein, replete with an analysis of the \nkey statutes being considered. Furthermore, after Mr. Epstein's defense team \ncomplained about the leak to the USAO, Mr. Weinstein, in Mr. Thomas' own \ndescription, then admonished him for talking to the defense, and getting him in \ntrouble. Mr. Weinstein further told him not to believe the \"spin\" of Mr. Epstein's \n\"high-priced attorneys,\" and then, according to Mr. Thomas, Mr. Weinstein \nforcefully \"reminded\" Mr. Thomas that all prior conversations were merely \nhypothetical. \nWe are constrained to conclude that the actions of federal officials in this case strike at \nthe heart of one of the vitally important, enduring values in this country: the honest enforcement \nof federal law, free of political considerations and free of the taint of personal financial \nmotivations on the part of federal prosecutors that, at a minimum, raise the appearance of serious \nimpropriety. \nWe were told by U.S. Attorney Acosta that as part of the review he requested, the \nDepartment had the authority, and his consent, to make any determination it deemed appropriate \nregarding this matter, including a decision to decline federal prosecution. Yet, CEOS's only \nconclusion, based on its limited review of the investigation, is that U.S. Attorney Acosta would \nnot abuse his discretion by proceeding against Mr. Epstein. Thus, the decision of whether \n4 \nAs recently as two months ago, Mr. Sloman was still listed publicly as a part of his former law firm. While we \nassume this was an oversight, Mr. Sloman's identification as part of the firm raises the appearance of \nimpropriety. \nA001444 \n\fHonorable Mark Filip \nMay 19, 2008 \nPage 8 \nprosecution is fair and appropriate has been placed, once again, in U.S. Attorney Acosta's \nhands. \nIn light of the foregoing, we respectfully ask that you review this matter and discontinue \nall federal involvement so that the State can appropriately bring this matter to closure. We \nwould greatly appreciate the opportunity to meet with you to discuss these important issues. \nSuch a meeting would provide the Department with an opportunity to review the paramount \nissues of federalism and the appearance of selectivity that are generated by the unprecedented \nattempts to broaden the ambit of federal statutes to places that they have never before reached. \nWe sincerely appreciate your attention to this matter. \nRespectfully submitted, \nKenneth W. Starr \nKirkland & Ellis LLP \nJoe D.

A decrease in a Partner's percentage interest in KUE because of KUE’s issuance of\nadditional limited partner units (“Limited Partner Units\"} would decrease such Partner's share of Company\nnonreccurse liabilities, if any, and thus would resuit in a corresponding deemed distribution of cash.\n\nTreatment of In-Kind Distributions. KUE's distribution of property (other than cash) to a Partner generally\nwill not be taxable to the Partner unless the property is a “marketable security” and the exceptions to the\nrequirement for recognition of gain upon distributions of marketable securities do not apply. Marketable\nsecurities, for these purposes, include actively traded securities or equity interests in another entity that\nare readily convertible into or exchangeable for cash or other marketable securities. If the distributed\nproperty constitutes a marketable security, the property would be treated as cash and the Partner would\nrecognize gain, but not loss, to the extent described above.\n\nBasis of Common LP Units. A Limited Partner will have an initial tax basis for its Common LP Units equal\nto the amount it paid for the Common LP Units plus its share of Company nonrecourse liabilities, if any.\nThat basis will be increased by the Limited Partner’s share of Company income and by any increases in\nits share of Company nonrecourse liabilities, if any. That basis will be decreased, but not below zero, by\ndistributions from KUE, by the Limited Partner’s share of KUE losses, by any decrease in its share of\nCompany nonrecourse liabilities, if any, and by its share of Company expenditures that are not deductible\nin computing KUE’s taxable income and are not required to be capitalized.\n\nLimitations on Deductibility of Company Losses. The deduction by a Limited Partner of its share of\nCompany lasses will be limited to the adjusted tax basis in its Common LP Units. Limited Partners should\nbe aware that they could be subject to various other limitations on their ability to deduct their allocable\nshares of Company losses (or items of deductions). Such limitations include, but are not limited to, those\nrelating to \"investment interest\" expense under Section 163(d) of the Code, \"miscellaneous itemized\ndeductions\" under Section 67 of the Code, certain other itemized deductions of high income individuals\nunder Section 68 of the Code, the “at risk” rules under Section 485 of the Code, and the deductibility of\ncapital losses under the Code. Prospective investors should consult their tax advisors with respect to the\npotential application of such rules to their particular situation.\n\nAllocation of income, Gain, Loss, and Deduction. If KUE has a net profit or net loss, its items of income,\ngain, loss, and deduction will be allocated among the Partners in accordance with the provisions of the\nLimited Partnership Agreement.\n\nDispositions of Common LP Units — Recognition of Gain or Loss. A Limited Partner will recognize gain or\nloss on a sale of Common LP Units equal to the difference between the amount realized and the Limited\n\nPartner's adjusted tax basis for the Common LP Units sold. A Limited Partner's amount realized will be\nmeasured by the sum of cash or the fair market value of other property received plus its share of\nCompany nonrecourse liabilities, if any. Generally, gain or loss recognized by a Limited Partner on the\nsale or exchange of Common LP Units will be taxable as capital gain or loss and as long-term capital gain\nor loss if the Common LP Units were held for more than twelve months.\n\nNon-U.S. Persons\n\nWithholding. Ownership of Common LP Units by non-U.S. Persons raises special U.S. federal income\ntax considerations. To the extent that KUE receives dividends from a U.S. subsidiary, distributions of\nsuch dividend income to Limited Partners who are non-US. Persons will be subject to U.S. withholding at\na rate of 30%, Certain countries have tax treaties with the U.S. that reduce or eliminate the withholding\nrequirement. To fhe extent that KUE receives dividends from a non-U.S. subsidiary, distributions of such\ndividend income to Limited Partners who are non-U.S. Persons will not be subject to U.S. tax, unless\nsuch income were deemed to be effectively connected with a trade or business conducted by KUE in the\nU.S. KUE will be required to pay withholding tax with respect to the portion of KUE’s income that is\n“effectively connected” with the conduct of a U.S. trade or business and which is allocable to non-U.S.\nPersons. Any amounts KUE is required to remit to taxing authorities will be treated as a distribution to the\nPartner on whose behalf the withholding is being paid and will be charged against current and/or future\n\n143\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_024576\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

We\nwere not allowed into the Chamber in which he was speaking, but were told to go to a special\nroom where we could watch and listen to his talk. We assembled in that room and watched as\nAhmadinejad was greeted with applause by many of the delegates. When he began to speak, we\ndiscovered that his words, delivered in Farsi, were not being translated to those of us in the\nseparate room, but only to those in Assembly Chamber. This was not acceptable and so I\nmarched to the Assembly Chamber and simply walked in. Several delegations were absent and so\nwe simply took their seats. But not for long. As soon as Ahmadinejad denied the Holocaust,\nwhich he did near the beginning of his speech, I stood up and shouted “Shame” and walked out,\npassing directly in front of his lectern. Many others walked out as well, including several\nEuropean delegations. Ahmadinejad’s talk was a fiasco, and was so reported by the media. He\nhad made a fool of himself, with little help from us.\n\nThe following year, the Durban Conference on human rights was once against convened, this time\nin New York. Once again, we convened parallel conferences. In my address, I made the\nfollowing point:\nOne important reason why there is no peace in the Middle East can be summarized\ntragically in two letters, UN. That building dedicated in theory to peace has facilitated\nterrorism, stood idly by genocide, given a platform to holocaust deniers, and\ndisincentivized the Palestinians from negotiating a reasonable two-state solution.\n\nHow dare states such as Saudi Arabia, Cuba, Venezuela, Zimbabwe, Iran, Bahrain, Syria,\nBelarus and other tyrannies too numerous to mention -- but if you want to see the list, just\ngo over to the next building -- read the list of nation states and you'll see more than half of\nthem fit this definition of undemocratic tyrannies. How dare those tyrannies lecture Israel\nabout human rights? How dare states such as Turkey, that have attacked their own\nKurdish minorities and Armenian minorities, and Russia, which has attacked its own\nChechnyan minority, how dare these warmongering countries lecture Israel about peace?\n\nHow dare Norway with its long and sordid history of anti-Semitism and collaboration with\nevil, a history which tragically persists to this day, how dare Norway lecture Israel on\nequality? How dare South Africa, which continues to practice de facto, though not de\njure apartheid, call Israel, which is far more integrated than South Africa, an apartheid\nstate?\n\n340\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_017427\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

His department\ndisseminated \"a distorted view of the case\" and behaved in a \"childish\" manner when the\ngrand jury didn't indict Epstein on the charges it sought, another Epstein lawyer\ncomplained.\n\nTo hear the Epstein camp tell it, Reiter, 48, is a loose cannon better suited to be the\nsheriff of Mayberry. They whisper that he's embroiled in a messy divorce.\n\nReiter did in fact file for divorce from his wife, NAME REMOVED), last year, after 24\nyears of marriage. They have a son, 18, and a daughter, 14. The couple is scheduled to go\nto mediation next week, Aug. 16. Nothing in the court file suggests their split is\nparticularly ugly.\n\nReiter incurred the wrath of the Epstein camp as well as the state attorney's office for two\nreasons. First, he pressed for Epstein to be charged with the more serious crimes of\nsexual activity with minors. Second, he slammed State Attorney Barry Krischer in blunt\nlanguage seldom used by one law-enforcement official concerning another because of\nwhat he perceived as that office's mishandling of the case.\n\nIn a letter to Krischer written May 1, Reiter called his actions in the Epstein case \"highly\nunusual.\" He added, \"I must urge you to... consider if good and sufficient reason exists to\nrequire your disqualification from the prosecution of these cases.\" In short, Reiter told\nthe county's top prosecutor for the past 13 years that he ought to get off the case. \"It\nlooks like a departure from professionalism,\" Miami-Dade State Attorney Katherine\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_021770\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

The powers that be intend now for these children\nto (continue to) follow in the footsteps of Ms. Simms, and to that end, | would advise that you\nbecome acquainted with (1) the ways in which Ms. Simms subsidized her law school education and\noff course (2) her current and related endeavors especially as they relate to drug trafficking and\nterror financing (see below email to Mr. Martin of the St. Augustine Record).\n\nOn Friday, June 23, 2017 8:36 AM, i yt:\n\nMr. Martin,\nSt. Augustine Record\n\nQuite an interesting article about the litigation between Deputy Banks and Rusty Rogers (see:\nDeputy Banks’ attorney claims FDLE agent’s credibility ‘destroyed’) It must also be explored, of\ncourse, that Officers Rodgers was once well respected for his investigation and exposure of a\nterrorist financing network that permeated the sunny state of Florida - (the NY Times reports) \"Agent\nRodgers joined the state’s elite investigative unit, the Florida Department of Law Enforcement, where\nhe quickly earned agent-of-the-year honors — and a meeting with the governor — for helping\ndismantle a terrorist financing network that stretched from Florida to the Middle East\" - and that\nterrorism is very much a well-protected U.S. industry (see below).\n\nGod forbid some poor should get away with disrupting the delicate state of secreted operations; as\nyou yourself report, \"As written in [Plaintiff Banks'] motion: “Defendant Rodgers’ false, misleading\nand inconsistent testimony throughout the discovery process is so pervasive and extreme, and\ninvolves so many material issues, it has destroyed Defendant's credibility on all issues...\" And here\nwe see the \"whole-of-government\" attempts to restore balance.\n\n*\n\nAs for the second Secret Service agent interviewed by the IBM Center for the Business of\nGovernment, his name is Dana Brown.

The first half of the legal ethics class was devoted\nto discussing the difficult problem of what a lawyer should do when a client gives him physical\nevidence, the possession of which itself might be a crime. Such evidence might include videos of\nchild pornography, stolen goods and other contraband. We considered a case where a legal aid\nlawyer had been told where his client buried the body of a college student he had murdered, but\nhis murder was not known to her parents or to the police. We also discussed the Joe Paterno case\nthat was then in the news and that raised questions regarding obligations to report serious\nmisconduct. The second hour, prosecutor Ocampo made a brief appearance in the classroom, to\ndiscuss ethical problems faced by international prosecutors. The class ended with a discussion\nabout the scope of confidentiality and what a lawyer should do if his client claims innocence and\nwould like to testify as to his innocence, but the lawyer firmly believes that he is guilty.\n\nFollowing that class I sent an hour preparing for my next seminar which is a class of freshman at\nHarvard College. The subject is “Where Does Your Morality Come From?”, and we discussed\nthe moral limits on spying and other forms of subterfuge directed against enemy countries.\n\nStraight from class I went to the Huntington Theater where I had been asked to comment on a\nplay that was opening there. The play was about the capture of Adolph Eichmann, and I spent\nabout an hour on the stage speaking and responding to questions from the director and the\n\naudience about the legal issues growing out of the highly publicized capture and trial by Israel.\n\nThursday was essentially my day of rest. I spent the day writing several short articles and doing\nresearch and writing on several pending projects, including my autobiography. Thursday night\nwas my only night of the week at home with my wife, and we spent it watching a dumb but\nentertaining movie called Crazy Stupid Love.\n\nFriday began with my annual checkup at my doctor’s office followed by lunch with Peter Norton,\ndirector of the Norton Antivirus Software. I met him and his wife Gwen for lunch at the Harvest,\nwhere we discussed, among other things, the use of computer viruses against the Iranian nuclear\nthreat. After lunch, I received an email from a lawyer representing Saif Ghadafi, who had just\nbeen apprehended by the Lybians. He wanted me to represent Ghadafi in the International\nCriminal Court and to negotiate for him to be tried in the Hague rather than in Tripoli. I asked\nfor more information before making a decision. I spent the rest of the afternoon working on\nwriting projects, and then went back to the law school at 6:30PM for a Shabbat dinner sponsored\nby Chabad and the Jewish Law Students Association. I am faculty advisor to both of those\norganizations and I gave a brief talk at the beginning of the dinner. My wife and I then attended a\nconcert at Sanders Theater.\n\nAt 5:30 on Saturday morning, I flew to fly to Washington DC to be a keynote speaker at an event\nsponsored by Iranian dissidents. The other speakers included former Secretary of Homeland\nSecurity, Tom Ridge, Former Chairman of the Democratic National Committee Howard Dean,\nformer Congressman Patrick Kennedy and several other former and current government officials.\nI then took the train back to New York, where I was hoping to attend the Metropolitan Opera,\nbut I was too tired and I went back to my apartment and ended the week by falling asleep at about\n10PM. My wife was proud of me for acknowledging my limitations, saying that 5 years earlier, I\nnever would have been willing to miss anything because of being tired.

The Board’s Section 6 Rulemaking\nAuthority\n\nNumerous comments dispute the\nBoard’s statutory authority to enact the\nproposed rule. Many note the fact that\nthe Board’s rulemaking is constrained\nby Congressional intent as evidenced in\nits enabling statute. For instance, the\nAmerican Trucking Association quotes a\nNinth Circuit case explaining that\nSection 6 ‘‘does not authorize the Board\nto promulgate rules and regulations\nwhich have the effect of enlarging its\nauthority beyond the scope intended by\nCongress,’ 11 and similarly, the Motor &\nEquipment Manufacturers Association\nasserts, “A regulation cannot stand if it\nis contrary to the statute.’’12 The Board\nagrees that it may not exercise its\nrulemaking authority in a way contrary\nto that intended by Congress, but for the\nreasons discussed below it also does not\nbelieve that it has done so in this rule.\n\nSeveral comments assert that because\nNLRA Section 6 is written in general,\nrather than specific, terms, the Board is\nnot empowered to enact the proposed\nrule. For example, Associated Builders\nand Contractors argues that “the lack of\nexpress statutory language under\nSection 6 of the NLRA to require the\nposting of a notice of any kind ‘is a\nstrong indicator, if not dispositive, that\nthe Board lacks the authority to impose\nsuch a requirement * * *.’’?18 And the\nHeritage Foundation likewise argues\nthat the Board’s reliance upon its\ngeneral Section 6 rulemaking authority\ndoes not suffice to meet the\nAdministrative Procedure Act’s\nrequirement that the NPRM must\n\n11 Gen. Eng’g, Inc. v. NLRB, 341 F.2d 367, 374\n(1965).\n\n12 Citing United States v. O’Hagan, 521 U.S. 642,\n673 (1997). However, the Supreme Court actually\nheld there that an agency’s interpretation of its\nenabling statute must be given ‘‘controlling weight\nunless it is arbitrary, capricious, or manifestly\ncontrary to the statute.” (quoting Chevron U.S.A.\nInc. v. Natural Res. Def. Council, Inc., 467 U.S. 837,\n844 (1984)). There, the Court upheld the rule and\nfound it was not arbitrary, capricious, or manifestly\ncontrary to the statute.\n\n13 Quoting Member Hayes’ dissent, 75 FR 80415.\n\n“reference the legal authority under\nwhich the rule is proposed.” 14\n\nThe Board believes that these\ncomments are in error because the\ncourts’ construction of other statutes’\ngeneral rulemaking authority, as well as\nSection 6 in particular, fully support its\nreading of this statutory provision. In\nfact, earlier this year, the Supreme Court\nissued a decision in Mayo Foundation\nfor Medical Education and Research v.\nUnited States 1° (discussed more fully\nbelow), unanimously reaffirming the\nprinciple that a general grant of\nrulemaking authority fully suffices to\nconfer legislative (or binding)\nrulemaking authority upon an agency.\n\nEven prior to Mayo, a long line of both\nnon-NLRA and NLRA cases supported\nreading Section 6 in the manner\nsuggested by the Board. Over forty years\nago, in Thorpe v. Housing Authority,'®\nthe Supreme Court found that the\nexpansive grant of rulemaking authority\nin Section 8 of the Housing Act was\nsufficient to grant legislative rulemaking\npower to the Department of Housing\nand Urban Development. The Court\nfurther noted that “[s]uch broad rule-\nmaking powers have been granted to\nnumerous other federal administrative\nbodies in substantially the same\nlanguage.’ 17 A few years later, in\nMourning v. Family Publication\nServices,1® the Court reaffirmed its\nstance in Thorpe:\n\nWhere the empowering provision of a\nstatute states simply that the agency may\n‘make * * * such rules and regulations as\nmay be necessary to carry out the provisions\nof this Act,’ we have held that the validity\nof a regulation promulgated thereunder will\nbe sustained so long as it is ‘reasonably\nrelated to the purposes of the enabling\nlegislation.’ 19\n\nFollowing the Supreme Court’s lead,\nkey circuit decisions then extended the\n\n14 See 5 USC 553(b)(2). For this conclusion, the\nHeritage Foundation cites Global Van Lines, Inc., v.\nICC, 714 F.2d 1290, 1297-98 (5th Cir. 1983). But\nGlobal Van Lines did not find that a general\nstatement of authority can never meet the APA’s\nrequirements to specify the legal authority for the\nrule. Instead, the Fifth Circuit held that that portion\nof the APA is violated when an agency chooses to\nrely on additional statutory provisions in support\nof its rule for the first time on appeal, and those\ngrounds do not appear elsewhere in the\nadministrative record. See id. at 1298-99. Here, in\ncontrast, the grounds for the Board’s rule are clearly\nlaid out in subsection B, Statutory Authority,\nbelow.\n\n145131 S.Ct. 704, 713-14 (2011).\n\n16 393 U.S. 268 (1969).\n\n17 Id, at 277 n. 28 (citations omitted). The\nrulemaking grant there at issue provided that HUD\nmay, “from time to time * * * make, amend, and\nrescind such rules and regulations as may be\nnecessary to carry out the provisions of this Act,”\nid. at 277, quite similar to Section 6 of the NLRA.\n\n18 411 U.S. 356 (1973).\n\n19 Id. at 369 (quoting Thorpe, 393 U.S. at 280-81).\n\nnotion that broad grants of rulemaking\nauthority conveyed legislative\nrulemaking power.?° Although the\nBoard had historically chosen to make\npolicy by adjudications, the Supreme\nCourt, consistent with the non-NLRA\ncase law, used a pair of Board\nenforcement cases to unanimously\nemphasize the existence of the Board’s\nlegislative rulemaking authority, NLRB\nv. Wyman-Gordon Co.2! and NLEB v.\nBell Aerospace.22\n\nIn 1991, after the Board enacted a rule\ninvolving health care units, the\nSupreme Court unanimously upheld\nthat rule in American Hospital\nAssociation v. NLRB.?* The Supreme\nCourt found that that the general grant\nof rulemaking authority contained in\nSection 6 of the Act “‘was\nunquestionably sufficient to authorize\nthe rule at issue in this case unless\nlimited by some other provision in the\nAct.” 24 As in AHA, there is no such\nlimitation here on the Board’s authority\nto enact the proposed Rule, as explained\nfurther below. As Senator Tom Harkin\nand Representative George Miller 25\nemphasized in their comment, the\nSupreme Court in AHA examined “the\nstructure and the policy of the NLRA,”\nin order to conclude:\n\nAs a matter of statutory drafting, if\nCongress had intended to curtail in a\nparticular area the broad rulemaking\nauthority granted in § 6, we would have\nexpected it to do so in language expressly\ndescribing an exception from that section or\nat least referring specifically to the section.?°\n\nThus, the Court could not have been\nclearer that unless the Board is\n“expressly” limited in some manner,\nSection 6 empowers the Board to make\n“such rules and regulations as may be\nnecessary to carry out the provisions of\nthis Act.” This point was underscored\n\n20 Nat’!

But, as we know, the Post turned\ndown his ultimatum.\n\nTime was running out if he was to break the story and leave Hong\nKong before the NSA realized he was missing. At best, he was safe\nuntil June 3, when he was supposed to return from his medical leave.\nIf he failed to show up in Hawaii on June 3, alarm bells at the NSA\nwould go off, and it would not take long to find him. Airline records\nwould show that he had flown to Hong Kong. Snowden told Poi-\ntras that NSA security would ask, “This guy isn’t where he says\nhe’s supposed to be. He’s supposed to be getting medical treatment.\nWhy the hell is he in Hong Kong?” It would not take long to deter-\nmine that he had lied about his medical treatment, and then the hunt\nwould begin.\n\nHe had, remember, already sent Poitras an enciphered file and told\nher she would get the key once she followed his instructions.

She really did want oral\nsex: she wanted to talk about it. And she did —to more than a dozen people. The President\nachieved immediate gratification while risking long term consequences to his marriage, his\ndaughter, his presidency and above all the nation’s stability.\n\nAt the time he began his sexual encounter with Lewinsky, Clinton knew that he might possibly\nhave to testify under oath about his sex life. He knew that two sets of enemies had the powerful\nlegal weapon of subpoena power aimed directly at his presidency. That is probably why he was\nreluctant to engage in sexual intercourse. He wanted sex with deniability. What he got was\nunsatisfying sex with unconvincing deniability. Or, as Maureen Dowd put it:\n\n“Mr. Clinton’s habit, with language and behavior, has been to try to incorporate\nhis alibi into his sin. The result is more twisted than titillating.”*™\n\nThis was surely not the first time Bill Clinton put his future at risk for immediate sexual\ngratification. But in every other instance he was able to avoid the long term consequences. I am\ncertain that he believed that this pattern of short term risk-taking and subsequent avoidance of\nlong term consequences would be repeated. I doubt he believed, at the moment that he first\nallowed Lewinsky to touch him in a sexual manner, that this action would eventually lead to\npossible removal from office and damage to his family life. He surely would not have consciously\ntaken such a knowing risk. But when people have succeeded so often in the past in achieving\nboth immediate gratification and long term avoidance of consequences, they miscalculate the odds\nand act as if they can have their cake and eat it too.\n\nThe history of many of my own celebrity clients is largely a history of defendants who for years —\nsometimes decades — have risked their careers, family lives, fortunes and freedom for some form\nof immediate gratification. Finally when they were caught, everyone asked the same question:\n“How could they have risked so much for so little?” What that question fails to understand is that\nthe “little” thing for which they were eventually caught was usually only the tip of a very large\niceberg of sin or crime which they had gotten away with for years. In their minds therefore, they\nwere risking very little (the extreme unlikelihood that this time they would get caught) for a great\ndeal (a lifetime of small, short term gratifications, which add up to something for which it is\nworth taking small risks.)\n\nIn retrospect, we consider such actions reckless because we are running the video backwards: we\nknow he was caught. But at the time Clinton made the decision, he probably did not regard it as\nany more reckless than the many similar decisions he had previously made, without destroying his\ncareer and his family. He had probably played the same sexual-verbal game before: limiting his\nsexual contact so that he could plausibly deny that he engaged in “sexual relationships” outside of\nhis marriage,*° but he never before had to testify under oath about these relationships. What he\nfailed to comprehend was how much the risks had increased as the result of the legal proceedings\n\n** See Maureen Dowd, Maladroit Du Siegneur, N.Y.Times, 9/30/98, p.A23. (“He would be laughed out of any\nlocker room in the country.”)\n\n85 Prior to the Lewinsky matter becoming public, there were widespread reports that the President limited his extra-\nmarital sex to oral gratification since he believed that it did not constitute Biblical adultery and it gave him verbal\ndeniability regarding sexual relations. This history actually strengthens his legal claim that he did not commit\nperjury when he denied having what he regarded as sexual relations with Lewinsky.

Over time, we began relying\nwherever possible on rubber bullets and, in extreme cases, snipers to target the\nlegs of the organizers or ring-leaders.\n\nIf all of this sounds soul-destroying, that’s because it was. Especially with\ndaily television coverage of the clashes amplifying overseas support for the\nPalestinians, morale among our soldiers also took a battering.

We have the weapons. Why the hell don’t we use them?\nBut we also heard another view, if less often: why are we here at all?\n\nWe imposed closures and curfews. We made thousands of arrests. Still,\nhundreds of soldiers and settlers were being injured, a number of them\ndisfigured or disabled. By the end of 1998, the Palestinian death toll was above\n300.

He warned Trump of potentially damaging material coming his way.\n“You need to take this seriously, Donald.”\n\n“Jared has this,” said a happy Trump. “It’s all worked out.”\n\n7 OK Ok\n\nTrump Tower, next door to Tiffany and now headquarters of a populist revolution,\nsuddenly seemed like an alien spaceship—the Death Star—on Fifth Avenue. As the great\nand good and ambitious, as well as angry protesters and the curious hoi polloi, began\nbeating a path to the next president’s door, mazelike barricades were hurriedly thrown up\nto shield him.\n\nThe Pre-Election Presidential Transition Act of 2010 established funding for\npresidential nominees to start the process of vetting thousands of candidates for jobs in a\nnew administration, codifying policies that would determine the early actions of a new\nWhite House, and preparing for the handoff of bureaucratic responsibilities on January 20.\nDuring the campaign, New Jersey governor Chris Christie, the nominal head of the Trump\ntransition office, had to forcefully tell the candidate that he couldn’t redirect these funds,\nthat the law required him to spend the money and plan for a transition—even one he did\nnot expect to need. A frustrated Trump said he didn’t want to hear any more about it.\n\nThe day after the election, Trump’s close advisers—suddenly eager to be part of a\nprocess that almost everybody had ignored—immediately began blaming Christie for a\nlack of transition preparations. Hurriedly, the bare-bones transition team moved from\ndowntown Washington to Trump Tower.\n\nThis was certainly some of the most expensive real estate ever occupied by a transition\nteam (and, for that matter, a presidential campaign). And that was part of the point. It sent\na Trump-style message: we’re not only outsiders, but we’re more powerful than you\ninsiders. Richer. More famous. With better real estate.\n\nAnd, of course, it was personalized: his name, fabulously, was on the door. Upstairs\nwas his triplex apartment, vastly larger than the White House living quarters. Here was his\nprivate office, which he’d occupied since the 1980s. And here were the campaign and now\ntransition floors—firmly in his orbit and not that of Washington and the “swamp.”\n\nTrump’s instinct in the face of his unlikely, if not preposterous, success was the\nopposite of humility. It was, in some sense, to rub everybody’s face in it. Washington\ninsiders, or would-be insiders, would have to come to him. Trump Tower immediately\nupstaged the White House.

The first\ncomment, from COLLE, argues that the\nprovision is misleading because it fails\nto acknowledge that an employer does\nnot have an obligation under the NLRA\nto consent to the establishment of a\ncollective-bargaining agreement, but\ninstead only has the statutory duty to\n“meet at reasonable times and confer in\ngood faith with respect to wages, hours,\nand other terms and conditions of\nemployment.” 29 U.S.C. 158(d). The\ncomment also argues that the failure to\nreach an agreement is not per se\nunlawful, and the finding of an unfair\nlabor practice depends on whether the\nparties engaged in good-faith bargaining.\nThis comment suggests that the notice\nshould instead note that the NLRA\nrequires parties to bargain in good faith\nbut does not compel agreement or the\nmaking of concessions, and that, in\nsome instances, a bargaining impasse\nwill result, permitting the parties to\nexercise their economic weapons, such\nas strikes or lockouts. The second\ncomment, made generally by more than\na few organizations and individuals,\nsuggests that the notice add a statement\nindicating that employers and unions\nhave an obligation to bargain in good\nfaith.\n\nThe Board finds it unnecessary to add\nthe suggested amplifications. For one\nthing, the notice does state that\nemployers and unions have a duty to\nbargain in good faith, “in a genuine\neffort to reach a written, binding\nagreement setting your terms and\nconditions of employment.” In the\nBoard’s view, the statement that the\nparties must make a ‘‘genuine effort” to\nreach agreement necessarily implies that\nthey are not, in the end, required to\nreach one. The Board deems the notice\nlanguage to be adequate on this point.\nFinally, for the reasons already\ndiscussed, the Board rejects the\ncontention that the notice should\ndiscuss the implications or\nconsequences of unsuccessful\nbargaining.\n\niii. The Right To Discuss With Co-\nWorkers or Union\n\nA comment from the National\nImmigration Law Center suggests that\nthe use of the phrase “terms and\nconditions of employment” is unclear\nespecially to employees who are\nunaware of their rights under the NLRA.\nThe comment recommends that, in\norder to clarify, the Board add the\nphrase “including wages and benefits.”\nThe suggested language would read,\n“you have the right to: discuss your\nterms and conditions of employment,\nincluding wages and benefits, or union\n\norganizing with your co-workers ora\nunion.”\n\nThe Board agrees that adding the\nsuggested language would clarify the\nprovision. The list of affirmative rights\nuses the terms ‘‘wages, hours, and other\nterms and conditions of employment” to\ndescribe what unions may negotiate.\nThe notice then uses the terms “wages,\nbenefits, hours, and other working\nconditions” to describe the right to\nbargain collectively for a contract. Those\nstatements make it clear that “terms and\nconditions of employment” includes\nwages and benefits. But then\nimmediately following those two\nstatements, the notice states that\nemployees may discuss ‘“‘terms and\nconditions of employment,” but does\nnot include any clarifying language. In\norder, to create a more uniform notice\nand clarify the extent to which\nemployees may discuss their terms and\nconditions of employment the final\nnotice will read, “Under the NLRA, you\nhave a right to: Discuss your wages and\nbenefits and other terms and conditions\nof employment or union organizing with\nyour co-workers or a union.”\n\niv. The Right To Strike and Picket\n\nThe notice’s reference to the right to\nstrike and picket received a few\ncomments from law firms and other\norganizations representing employers’\ninterests. The comments suggest that the\nprovision is flawed because of the\nabsence of further limitations,\nexceptions, and distinctions.1°¢\nGenerally, the comments argue that not\nall strikes and pickets are protected.\nCOLLE argues that the notice should\ninform employees of the limitations of\nstrikes encompassed by “depending on\nthe purpose or means of the strike or\npickets’’—for example, whether the\nstrike is for recognition or bargaining,\nwhether the strike has a secondary\npurpose, whether picketing involves a\nreserved gate, whether the strike is a sit-\ndown or minority strike, whether the\nconduct is a slowdown and not a full\nwithholding of work, whether the strike\nis partial or intermittent, whether the\nstrike involves violence, and whether\nthe strike is an unfair labor practice\nstrike or an economic strike. ALFA\nargues that employees should be\ninformed that if the employer is a\nhealthcare institution, “employees do\nnot have the right to participate in a\nunion-initiated strike or picket unless\nthe union has provided the employer\nand federal and state mediation agencies\nwith the required 10 days notice.”\n\n106 See comments of ALFA, Carrollton Health and\nRehabilitation Center, and COLLE.\n\nThe Board disagrees. By necessity, an\n11x17-inch notice cannot contain an\nexhaustive list of limitations on and\nexceptions to the rights to strike and\npicket, as suggested by employers.\nHowever, because exercising the right to\nstrike can significantly affect the\nlivelihood of employees, the Board\nconsiders it important to alert\nemployees that there are some\nlimitations to exercising this right. The\nBoard is satisfied that the general\ncaveat, “depending on the purpose or\nmeans of the strike or the picketing,”\ntogether with the instruction to contact\nthe NLRB with specific questions about\nthe application of rights in certain\nsituations, provides sufficient guidance\nto employees about the exercise of their\nrights while still staying within the\nconstraints set by a necessarily brief\nemployee notice.\n\nv. The Right To Refrain From Union or\nOther Protected Concerted Activity\n\nAll the comments that discuss the\nright to refrain from engaging in union\nactivity criticize what they contend to\nbe its lack of prominence. ALFA accuses\nthe Board of ‘‘burying” the provision by\nplacing it last, below the other rights to\nengage in union and other concerted\nactivity. The U.S. Chamber of\nCommerce suggests that the notice\ninclude “‘or not’”’ after each of the\nenumerated rights. For example, ‘‘you\nhave the right to: form join or assist a\nunion, or not.” (Emphasis added.) Other\nsuggested revisions to amplify the\nprominence of the provision include\nstating that employees have the right to\nrefrain from protected, concerted\nactivities and/or union activities; stating\nthat employees’ right to refrain includes\nthe right to actively oppose\nunionization, to not sign union\nauthorization cards, to request a secret\nballot election, to not be a member of a\nunion or pay dues or fees (addressed\nfurther below), or to decertify a union\n(also addressed below); and stating that\nemployees have the right to be fairly\nrepresented even if not a member of the\nunion. One employer suggests that if the\nnotice retains its current emphasis\nfavoring union activity and disfavoring\nthe freedom to refrain from such\nactivity, employers will need to post\ntheir own notices that emphasize and\nelaborate on the right to refrain.\n\nThe Board received at least four\ncomments that argue that the notice, as\nwritten, may make employees believe\nthat the employer is encouraging\nunionization. Two of those comments\nsuggest that an employer is protected\nfrom compelled speech by Section 8(c)\nof the NLRA. (The Board has already\nrejected the latter argument; see section\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_022292\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

This does not even make sense, legally or factually. Jane Doe #3’s right to join in this\ncase has nothing to do with Jane Doe #1 and Jane Doe #2’s entitlement to documents in\ndiscovery. In fact, the discovery requests that Jane Doe #3 cites to in her Response as purported\ncover for their sliming of Prof Dershowitz show that their argument is factually bogus. Prof.\nDershowitz is mentioned in only two of twenty-five requests for production propounded by Jane\nDoe #1 and Jane Doe #2. (See Jane Doe #1 and Jane Doe #2’s First Request for Production to\nthe Government Regarding Information Relevant to Their Pending Action Concern [sic] the\nCrime Victims Act, at DE 225-1 at 26-38.) Both requests, nos. 8 and 21 seek his\ncommunications with the government in his role as Mr. Epstein’s defense attorney. There is no\nissue of complicity or knowledge in any misconduct. Moreover, a fact conveniently omitted by\nJane Doe #3 is that Prof. Dershowitz is one of eleven lawyers whose communications Jane Doe\n#1 and Jane Doe #2 sought in the requests for production. As the Court knows, Prof. Dershowitz\nhad no material connection to this case—as to the merits or as to discovery—before he was\ndragged in by Jane Doe #3.\n\nThird, Jane Doe #3 claims that the smears against Prof. Dershowitz are relevant to show\n\nthat Prof. Dershowitz had a motive to negotiate “confidentiality” and “blank check” provisions\n\ndiscovery requests regarding her belief that Prince Andrew was somehow involved in “lobbying\nefforts to persuade the Government to give him a more favorable plea arrangement,” and because\nher allegations against Prince Andrews occurred in London, therefore “affect[ing] foreign\ncommerce” are patently absurd. (DE 291 at 20 and 18, fn. 10.) Because Jane Doe #3’s other\nallegations are replete with allegations of interstate activity and because implications of Prince\nAndrew’s involvement in “lobbying” for the NPA are entirely nonsensical, it is obvious that the\ninclusion of claims against Prince Andrew were included solely for their intended audience: the\nmedia.\n6\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_010740\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

The statute has never been applied to a “John,” and only a highly and\nimpermissibly selective prosecution could stretch § 1591 to reach conduct like that at issue in\nthis case.\n\nIn short, without “novel” interpretive expansions—a description used by CEOS itself—it\ncannot be shown that Mr. Epstein violated any of the three federal statutes identified by\nprosecutors. As the Supreme Court’s recent decisions in Santos and Cuellar make clear, federal\nlaw may not be stretched in that manner, and the current federal investigation relies, as its\nfoundation, on impermissibly elastic stretches of each statute beyond any reported precedent;\nbeyond the essential elements of each statute; well outside the ordinary construction of each\nstatute’s limitations; and on a selective, extraordinary, and unwarranted expansion of federal law\nto cover conduct that has always been exclusively within the core of state powers.\n\nAt this point in time, the need for Departmental oversight is critical. We appreciate this\nopportunity to submit our assessment of the key facts in this case and review of the pertinent\nfederal statutes, and respectfully request that the Office of the Deputy Attorney General end\nfederal involvement in this matter so that the State of Florida may resolve this case appropriately.\n\nSummary of the Facts\n\nMr. Epstein has maintained a home in Palm Beach, Florida for the past 20 years. While\nthere, he routinely conducted business, received medical attention, socialized with friends, and\nhelped care for his elderly mother. Mr. Epstein also had various women visit his home to\nperform massages. He did not personally schedule the massage appointments or communicate\nwith the women over the phone or the Internet. Rather, Mr. Epstein’s personal assistants\nscheduled many types of appointments, personal trainers, chiropractors, business meetings and\nmassages. The phone message pad taken from his house and in the possession of the\ngovernment confirmed that in many cases, the women themselves contacted Mr. Epstein’s\nassistants to inquire about his availability—trather than vice versa.\n\nThe majority of the massages were just that and nothing else. Mr. Epstein often would be\non the telephone conducting business while he received his massage. At times, the masseuses\nwould be topless, and some sexual activity might occur—primarily self-masturbation on the part\nof Mr. Epstein. On other occasions, no sexual activity would occur at all. There was no pattern\nor practice regarding which masseuse would be scheduled on a particular day—if one would be\nscheduled at all—or whether any sexual activity might occur. Indeed, Mr. Epstein almost never\nknew which masseuse his assistants had scheduled until she arrived. See Tab 3, To\nRecords.\n\nMr. Epstein specifically requested that each masseuse be at least 18 years old. The vast\nmajority of the masseuses were in fact in their twenties, many accompanied to Mr. Epstein’s\nhome by friends or even other family members. Furthermore, most of the women who have\ntestified that they were actually under 18 have specifically admitted to systematically lying to\nMr. Epstein about their age.

As recently as May 6, Secretary of State Clinton was still talking about a “reform agenda” in Syria, as if Bashar al-Assad were a slightly misguided bureaucrat rather than the murderer of roughly 1,000 unarmed demonstrators. As for the president, though the White House has issued a couple of statements in his name, he has yet to say one word on camera about the bloodletting in Syria. This is not a small matter, for a tough statement attacking the regime’s repression and giving the demonstrators moral support would immediately circulate over the Internet. American sanctions against Syria, meanwhile, have not named Assad, and there has been no call for him to step down.\n\nWhy is the administration appearing to stick with Assad and refusing to call for his ouster? A key reason may be the hope that an Israeli-Syrian peace deal can be arranged. \n\nFrom the day it came to office, the Obama administration clearly wanted to win an Israeli-Palestinian peace agreement. There has been no progress during its two years in office, mostly because the White House insisted on a 100 percent construction freeze in the West Bank settlements and Jerusalem as a precondition for negotiations. This was politically impossible in Israel, and also meant that Palestinian president Mahmoud Abbas could not come to the table lest he appear to be asking less from Israel than the Americans.\n\nWith negotiations frozen, the Palestinians turned to unilateral measures: seeking a United Nations vote admitting the State of Palestine to membership and getting dozens of countries to recognize a Palestinian state. Meanwhile, their delegitimization campaign against Israel continued apace, especially in Europe, where calls for boycotts and sanctions spread. On the pro-Israel side there was also consideration of unilateral measures—steps to head off the Palestinians diplomatically (several of which I described and supported in the April 11 Weekly Standard).\n\nSome forlorn hope may still have existed inside the administration that a compromise on construction could bring the Palestinians back to the table with the government of Israel—until the agreement between Hamas and Fatah was signed on April 27. This agreement, unless and until it collapses, makes Israeli concessions or new flexibility in the West Bank impossible and puts paid to the entire “peace process.” It brings Hamas into the Palestinian Authority government, ending a period of several years when Palestinian Security Forces have cooperated with the Israel Defense Forces against terrorism and against Hamas in particular. It will also bring Hamas—next year and for the first time—into the PLO, the body charged with negotiating peace with Israel. Even Yasser Arafat resisted that development when he headed the PLO, and it seems obvious that Israel cannot negotiate peace with an anti-Semitic terrorist group bent on its destruction.\n\nSo where can the White House turn if it wants some kind of peace process in the Middle East? Syria. After all, in his first term as prime minister, back in 1998, Benjamin Netanyahu did authorize indirect negotiations with Syria. And the IDF—and especially Ehud Barak, a former head of the IDF, Israel’s defense minister, and a close adviser to Netanyahu—has long favored such a deal. The IDF theory was that if Syria made peace, so would Lebanon, and then Israel would be at peace with all four neighboring Arab states. And it can be argued now that Assad may see negotiations with Israel as a way to climb back from the pariah status he is earning, making him at this juncture truly open to a new peace process.\n\nSuch thinking, whether in Jerusalem or the White House, is foolish and even grotesque. There is no possibility that Assad would negotiate seriously and that an agreement could be attained. He is now clinging desperately to power, and his only true allies are Iran and Hezbollah. Yet Israel’s (and, one hopes, our own) key precondition to any agreement would necessarily be a clean break in those relationships: an end to the Syrian alliance with Hezbollah and Iran. Otherwise Israel would be giving the Golan, in effect, to Iran—a suicidal act. No Israeli government would do it, which suggests that negotiations with Assad would have no purpose.\n\nAssad may indeed be open to commencing a negotiation as a means to escape international isolation, but that’s all the more reason not to give it to him. Prime Minister Ehud Olmert’s 2008 talks with Syria (via Turkey) allowed Syria to escape the partial isolation the United States had imposed on it in that decade, with zero gain for Israel. This is not an experiment worth repeating, for the Assad regime is today even more despicable than it was three years ago.\n\nTo react to the murders now taking place all over Syria by embracing the Assad regime would be morally indefensible. Whether Assad can be overthrown soon by the people of Syria is a fair question to ask. Will the army stay with him, or will Sunni units rebel? Will the Sunni business elites turn against him? How long can the regime survive? We do not yet know the answers. But surely we must avoid any step that could help Assad, rehabilitate his regime, or undermine the courageous struggle of peaceful demonstrators in the streets of Syria. \n\nThe peace agreements that Israel signed with Egypt and Jordan were real achievements, but there will be no such agreements with the Palestinians or with Syria in the foreseeable future. The Palestinians have taken themselves out of the game for now. We cannot turn from them to the Syrians while Assad’s troops are using howitzers and sniper rifles against his people. This is the time not for diplomatic engagement with Assad, but for diplomacy aimed at quarantining his regime and helping bring it down. The White House should dismiss any remaining dreams of a “peace process” with Syria to substitute for the Palestinian version and face facts: There will be no peace with the butcher who rules Syria today. \n\n\n\nElliott Abrams, senior fellow for Middle Eastern studies at the Council on Foreign Relations, was a deputy national security adviser in the George W. Bush administration.\n\n\n\n\n\fArticle 2.\n\nThe Daily Star\n\nA democratic Arab world would welcome peace with Israel\nHamid Alkifaey\n\nOne could reasonably argue that the golden opportunity for peace in the Middle East was blown away when Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin was assassinated on Nov. 4, 1995. \nHe was the only Israeli leader capable of making peace with the Palestinians, and was about to do so had it not been for the bullets of Yigal Amir, the right-wing religious zealot who believed in the “winner takes all” principle. \nOne could also claim that the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and its global ramifications are responsible for agitating religious extremism in the Muslim world as a whole, and among Palestinians in particular. Prior to 1987, there was hardly any Islamic factor in Palestinian resistance. The Hamas and Islamic Jihad groups were established after the 1987 intifada. From this we deduce that extremism on the Israeli side led to the same on the Palestinian side, and consequently in other Muslim countries, which manifests in popular opposition to traditional and despotic regimes.\nThe Arab world is currently going through a social and political revolution that has so far claimed two “entrenched” regimes in Tunisia and Egypt. At least three other regimes in the region are fighting for their lives, and are not expected to survive. There will soon be different styles of government in Libya, Yemen and Syria. This much is certain. \nWill there be a different policy toward Israel? Certainly. But this will take time to take shape, since there are more pressing national priorities, such as political and economic reforms. Israel has long branded the Arab world as tribal and undemocratic, in order to brand itself the only democracy in the Middle East. Well, soon enough it won’t be. Many of its neighbors will soon join the democratic world as demands for democracy grow. Democracy will mean more development, prosperity and people’s power. It means more popular participation in decision making and awareness of the possibilities of the nation and what it can and cannot do. It may not mean more hostility toward Israel if the latter knows how to deal with it. But there will be tension if Israel continues to follow extreme policies, which it will under the current leadership of Benjamin Netanyahu. \nThe Palestinians must achieve their right to establish their own state on their land. This right has been recognized by almost everyone except a minority of extremists in Israel, led by Netanyahu. Free and democratic Arab countries won’t shrink from supporting this Palestinian right under any circumstances. Muslims will not give up on East Jerusalem, either. Arab regimes have been weak in the past. Democracy will strengthen them, but also add reason to Arab governance. Most Arabs have accepted Israel’s right to exist, and accepted U.N. resolutions 242 and 338, but Israeli intransigence is not helping them formulate a unified position. \nDemocratic Egypt won’t be a threat to Israel as the Egyptian military, which will continue to be highly influential in Egypt’s politics in the foreseeable future, will not risk another war with Israel. Egyptians under a democratic regime will be seeking better living standards, better laws to govern the country and more rights as citizens. They won’t be pressing their government to fight Israel; on the contrary, they want a stable economy where things will be better for future generations. But Israel may aggravate the situation by electing extremists and following extreme policies. This will strengthen the hands of the hawks in the Arab world. Moderate Israel under reasonable and realistic leaders should have nothing to fear from Egypt, with which it has an enduring peace treaty. \nThe situation with Syria may not be exactly the same, however, especially when the two countries are still officially in a state of war. The regime of Bashar Assad, and his father before him, would have never started a war with Israel unilaterally. It also suited them not to have a peace treaty. Any new Syrian leader is not likely (for a considerable period of time) to initiate a move toward a peace agreement with Israel as this will weaken his position domestically. Nor will he launch a war, however, since such a war will not result in victory. A democratic regime in Syria, or any other Arab country for that matter, will need a good 10 years to build democratic institutions and stabilize a modern market economy needed in any democracy. So, war won’t be on the agenda in the near future.\nProsperity increases the public’s stake in a stable economy, and this will make people want to compromise to make their country more prosperous and stable. However, everything will depend on how prepared the free world is to help new democracies in the Middle East survive and prosper. Small Islamic groups, organized and armed with religious zeal, could hijack power from the moderates. This would lead to a disaster for the whole region. Therefore, it is imperative for the free world, Israel included, not to leave matters to chance. A proactive stance is needed to nurture democracy and help moderate forces organize themselves in order to govern the region\n\nHamid Alkifaey is a writer and journalist.

With the new president standing beside Mitchell and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, Vice President Joe Biden took the podium and extolled Mitchell's reputation and experience having brokered peace in Northern Ireland, calling him an \"outstanding public servant\" with \"incredible capacity.\" In the press, Mitchell was praised as the right man for the job at the right time.\n\nOn Friday, though, that capacity had reached its limit, and Mitchell told his bosses in the West Wing that he'd had enough. His reasons, he said, were personal—the kind of nebulous rationale that leaves ample room for interpretation. Unmentioned were the months of frustration that Mitchell had built up as direct negotiations between Israelis and Palestinians became more difficult and the peace process further off.\n\nThe timing of Mitchell's departure couldn't be more awkward. Obama will meet with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Jordan's King Abdullah next week, as well as deliver a major speech on Middle East policy. But the resignation didn't come as a surprise to those who worked closest with Mitchell. A State Department official described to Newsweek a man increasingly annoyed by both parties' constant moving of the goal posts and the constraints of the administration's unshakeable political instinct to support Israel.\n\nThe strain was noticeable in the Middle East. In a recent interview with Newsweek, one senior Israeli official said Mitchell often would say one thing about the direction the U.S. was taking with the two sides, only to be contradicted by Dennis Ross, Clinton's special adviser to the region. The official, who did not want to be quoted by name, said it seemed as if Mitchell had abdicated his role completely in recent months. Indeed, Mitchell's frequent visits to Israel and the West Bank slowed to a trickle; his last visit to the region was in December.\n\nWhen he was there, officials on both sides of the conflict had voiced bewilderment at Mitchell's hands-off approach to the complex negotiating process. With a small staff in Israel, he would shuttle between Jerusalem and Ramallah to meet with senior advisers to the leaders of both sides and then leave after just a few days. In an interview with Newsweek last month, Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas openly accused Mitchell of not doing his job. \"Every visit by Mitchell, we talked to him and gave him some ideas,\" he said. \"At the end we discovered that he didn't convey any of these ideas to the Israelis. What does it mean?\"\n\nA politically attuned man who was once Senate Majority Leader, Mitchell was aware of the complaints about him. His usual comeback was to point to his success in Northern Ireland, which earned him the Presidential Medal of Freedom. For hundreds of days, he liked to say, he was considered a failure, until the final day, when he actually got it done.\n\nMitchell's resignation letter set off a small panic inside the West Wing earlier in the week. Senior advisers, as well as Obama himself, could sense the increasing difficulty of the job: Administration officials had been unable to convince Israel to halve new settlements in the West Bank, alienating Palestinians, and Israelis were irked in early May when Abbas allied with Hamas, a group that refuses to denounce violence against Israel. But the symbolism of Mitchell leaving several days before Obama's biggest week of outreach to the region projected a vacuum of confidence that anything hopeful, however remote, was on the horizon.\n\n\"He wouldn't be leaving at this important hour if he knew there was going to be a significant change in the administration's attitude toward the peace process,\" said Middle East analyst Gregory Orfalea, who formerly taught at Georgetown's School of Foreign Service. \"He's leaving because it's status quo.\"\n\nMitchell will be replaced—in the interim by his deputy, David Hale—and another official will take a crack at the quandary. But despite new momentum from Netanyahu's visit next week and Obama's speech Thursday, Mitchell's departure could signal stagnant talks for the next several years. According to Fawaz Gerges, director of the London School of Economics' Middle East Center, \"the reality is that, with Mitchell leaving, Barack Obama basically lost the ideological battle [over how to confront the peace process]. By now he'll have to wait for the second term before you can get another concerted effort.\"\n\n\n\nDaniel Stone is Newsweek's White House correspondent.

Despite significant pressure from the Obama administration to remain on the sidelines, Saudi leaders sent troops into Manama in March to defend Bahrain’s monarchy and quell the unrest that has shaken that country since February. For more than 60 years, Saudi Arabia has been bound by an unwritten bargain: oil for security. Riyadh has often protested but ultimately acquiesced to what it saw as misguided U.S. policies. But American missteps in the region since Sept. 11, an ill-conceived response to the Arab protest movements and an unconscionable refusal to hold Israel accountable for its illegal settlement building have brought this arrangement to an end. As the Saudis recalibrate the partnership, Riyadh intends to pursue a much more assertive foreign policy, at times conflicting with American interests. The backdrop for this change are the rise of Iranian meddling in the region and the counterproductive policies that the United States has pursued here since Sept. 11. The most significant blunder may have been the invasion of Iraq, which resulted in enormous loss of life and provided Iran an opening to expand its sphere of influence. For years, Iran’s leadership has aimed to foment discord while furthering its geopolitical ambitions. Tehran has long funded Hamas and Hezbollah; recently, its scope of attempted interference has broadened to include the affairs of Arab states from Yemen to Morocco. This month the chief of staff of Iran’s armed forces, Gen. Hasan Firouzabadi, harshly criticized Riyadh over its intervention in Bahrain, claiming this act would spark massive domestic uprisings.\n\nSuch remarks are based more on wishful thinking than fact, but Iran’s efforts to destabilize its neighbors are tireless. As Riyadh fights a cold war with Tehran, Washington has shown itself in recent months to be an unwilling and unreliable partner against this threat. The emerging political reality is a Saudi-led Arab world facing off against the aggression of Iran and its non-state proxies. Saudi Arabia will not allow the political unrest in the region to destabilize the Arab monarchies — the Gulf states, Jordan and Morocco. In Yemen, the Saudis are insisting on an orderly transition of power and a dignified exit for President Ali Abdullah Saleh (a courtesy that was not extended to Hosni Mubarak, despite the former Egyptian president’s many years as a strong U.S. ally). To facilitate this handover, Riyadh is leading a diplomatic effort under the auspices of the six-country Gulf Cooperation Council. In Iraq, the Saudi government will continue to pursue a hard-line stance against the Maliki government, which it regards as little more than an Iranian puppet. In Lebanon, Saudi Arabia will act to check the growth of Hezbollah and to ensure that this Iranian proxy does not dominate the country’s political life. Regarding the widespread upheaval in Syria, the Saudis will work to ensure that any potential transition to a post-Assad era is as peaceful and as free of Iranian meddling as possible.  Regarding Israel, Riyadh is adamant that a just settlement, based on King Abdullah’s proposed peace plan, be implemented. This includes a Palestinian state with its capital in East Jerusalem. The United States has lost all credibility on this issue; after casting the sole vote in the U.N. Security Council against censuring Israel for its illegal settlement building, it can no longer act as an objective mediator. This act was a watershed in U.S.-Saudi relations, guaranteeing that Saudi leaders will not push for further compromise from the Palestinians, despite American pressure.\n\nSaudi Arabia remains strong and stable, lending muscle to its invigorated foreign policy. Spiritually, the kingdom plays a unique role for the world’s 1.2 billion Muslims — more than 1 billion of whom are Sunni — as the birthplace of Islam and home of the two holiest cities. Politically, its leaders enjoy broad domestic support, and a growing nationalism has knitted the historically tribal country more closely together. This is largely why widespread protests, much anticipated by Western media in March, never materialized. As the world’s sole energy superpower and the de facto central banker of the global energy markets, Riyadh is the economic powerhouse of the Middle East, representing 25 percent of the combined gross domestic product of the Arab world. The kingdom has amassed more than $550 billion in foreign reserves and is spending more than $150 billion to improve infrastructure, public education, social services and health care.  To counter the threats posed by Iran and transnational terrorist networks, the Saudi leadership is authorizing more than $100 billion of additional military spending to modernize ground forces, upgrade naval capabilities and more. The kingdom is doubling its number of high-quality combat aircraft and adding 60,000 security personnel to the Interior Ministry forces. Plans are underway to create a “Special Forces Command,” based on the U.S. model, to unify the kingdom’s various special forces if needed for rapid deployment abroad. Saudi Arabia has the will and the means to meet its expanded global responsibilities. In some issues, such as counterterrorism and efforts to fight money laundering, the Saudis will continue to be a strong U.S. partner. In areas in which Saudi national security or strategic interests are at stake, the kingdom will pursue its own agenda. With Iran working tirelessly to dominate the region, the Muslim Brotherhood rising in Egypt and unrest on nearly every border, there is simply too much at stake for the kingdom to rely on a security policy written in Washington, which has backfired more often than not and spread instability. The special relationship may never be the same, but from this transformation a more stable and secure Middle East can be born. \n\n\n\nThe writer is a senior fellow at the King Faisal Center for Research & Islamic Studies. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\fArticle 5.\n\nNewsweek\n\nDr. K’s Rx for China\n\nNiall Ferguson\n\n\n\nMay 15, 2011  -- Secretary of State Hillary Clinton thinks the Chinese government is “scared” of the Arab Spring. “They’re worried,” she told Jeffrey Goldberg in the latest Atlantic, “and they are trying to stop history, which is a fool’s errand. They cannot do it.”\n\nThese are words—intemperate, undiplomatic, and very likely counterproductive—that you cannot imagine being uttered by her predecessor Henry Kissinger. It is now 40 years since Kissinger went on his secret mission to China, to pave the way for President Richard Nixon’s historic visit the following year. Since then he has visited the country more than 50 times. And if there is one thing he has learned, it is this: the real fool’s errand is to lean on the Chinese. Much has changed in the world since Kissinger’s first trip to China. (In 1971, who would have dared to predict that America’s public enemy No. 1 would be a Saudi-born Islamic fundamentalist skulking in a walled compound in Pakistan?) But at least two things in American foreign policy remain consistent: the relationship with mainland China, revived by Kissinger after more than 20 years in the deep freeze, and Kissinger himself, consulted formally or informally by every president from John F. Kennedy to Barack Obama. On China, Kissinger’s new book, is a reminder of why our leaders still want to pick his brains. Eighty-eight years old this month, he remains without equal as a strategic thinker.  The opening to China is a story Kissinger has told before: how he and Nixon had discerned that country could become a strategic counterweight to the Soviet Union; how he secretly flew to China after feigning illness in Pakistan; how he and Premier Zhou Enlai hammered out the diplomatic basis for Nixon’s official visit (the Shanghai Communiqué). The result was, as he puts it, “a quasi alliance,” which, though initially intended to contain the Soviet Union, ended up outliving the Cold War.\n\nIn this telling, however, Kissinger is able to take advantage of recent research that illuminates the Chinese side of the story. The American opening to China was also a Chinese opening to America, actuated above all by Mao Zedong’s fear of encirclement. “Think about this,” Mao told his doctor in 1969. “We have the Soviet Union to the north and the west, India to the south, and Japan to the east. If all our enemies were to unite, attacking us from the north, south, east, and west, what do you think we should do?” The medic had no idea. “Think again,” said Mao. “Beyond Japan is the United States. Didn’t our ancestors counsel negotiating with faraway countries while fighting with those that are near?” It was to explore the American option that Mao recalled four Army marshals from exile. Skirmishes were already underway between Soviet and Chinese forces on the Ussuri River. In October 1970 Mao ordered China’s top leadership to evacuate Beijing and put the People’s Liberation Army on “first-degree combat readiness.” The stakes for China were high indeed—higher than for the United States.  As Kissinger shows, it was far from unusual for Mao to refer to “our ancestors’ counsel.” Despite his lifelong commitment to Marxism-Leninism, Mao was also steeped in the classics of Chinese civilization, as were his close advisers. “We can consult the example of Zhuge Liang’s strategic guiding principle,” Marshal Ye Jian-ying suggested, “when the three states of Wei, Shu, and Wu confronted each other: ‘Ally with Wu in the east to oppose Wei in the north.’ ” The allusion, Kissinger explains, is to Romance of the Three Kingdoms, a 14th-century epic novel set in the so-called Warring States period (475–221 B.C.).\n\nNor was this the only occasion when China’s communist leaders looked to the distant past for inspiration. Of equal importance to them, Kissinger argues, was The Art of War by Sun Tzu, which dates from the even earlier Spring and Autumn period (770–476 B.C.). “The victorious army/Is victorious first/And seeks battle later”: axioms like this one encouraged Chinese strategists to think of international relations like the board game Weiqi (known in the West as Go), a “game of surrounding pieces.”   Mao shared with China’s prerevolutionary leaders an assumption that China is not like other countries. With a population that amounts to a fifth of humanity, it is Zhongguo: the Middle Kingdom or, perhaps more accurately, the “Central Country.” At times it could even seem like tian xia: “all under heaven.” The best foreign policy for such an empire was to “let barbarians fight barbarians.” If that failed, then the strongest of the barbarians should be embraced and civilized (as happened to the Manchus).   “Domineering and overwhelming … ruthless and aloof, poet and warrior, prophet and scourge”—Mao’s true hero was not Lenin but the tyrannical, book-burning “first emperor,” Qin Shi Huang, who united China in 221 B.C. In a similar way, Kissinger shows, the current generation of Chinese leaders have drawn inspiration from the teachings of Kong Fu Zi (known in the West as Confucius). Their goal, he argues, is not world domination but da tong: “great harmony.”   This goes to the heart of the matter. In 1971, when Kissinger first went to China, the U.S. economy was roughly five times that of the People’s Republic. Forty years later, as a result of the industrial revolution unleashed by Mao’s successor Deng Xiao-ping, it is conceivable that China could overtake America within a decade. This is a feat the Soviet Union never came close to achieving. Moreover, China is now the biggest foreign holder of U.S. Treasury notes, which form an important part of its vast $3 trillion of international reserves. How China will use its newfound economic power may be the most important question of our time. Few Americans are better placed to answer that question than Kissinger, who has dealt with four generations of Chinese leaders.\n\nThe most profound insights of On China are psychological. They concern the fundamental cultural differences between a Chinese elite who can look back more than two millennia for inspiration and an American elite whose historical frame of reference is little more than two centuries old. This became most obvious in the wake of June 1989, when Americans recoiled from the use of military force to end the Tiananmen Square pro-democracy demonstrations. To Kissinger’s eyes, it was doubly naive to retaliate to this crackdown with sanctions: “Western concepts of human rights and individual liberties may not be directly translatable … to a civilization for millennia ordered around different concepts. Nor can the traditional Chinese fear of political chaos be dismissed as an anachronistic irrelevancy needing only ‘correction’ by Western enlightenment.”\n\nAs China’s first Anglophone leader, Jiang Zemin, explained to Kissinger in 1991: “We never submit to pressure … It is a philosophical principle.”   The United States and China went to war in Korea because of another cultural gap. It came as a surprise to the Americans when Mao ordered Chinese intervention because the military odds looked so unfavorable. But, argues Kissinger, his “motivating force was less to inflict a decisive military first blow than to change the psychological balance, not so much to defeat the enemy as to alter his calculus of risks.” Mao was a master of the ancient Empty City Stratagem, which seeks to conceal weakness with a show of confidence, even aggression. To Westerners, his insistence that he did not fear a nuclear attack seemed unhinged or, at best, callous (“We may lose more than 300 million people. So what? War is war. The years will pass, and we’ll get to work producing more babies than ever before”). But this was classical Chinese bravado, or “offensive deterrence.”    “Chinese negotiators,” observes Kissinger in a passage that should be inwardly digested not just by American diplomats but also by American businessmen before they land in Beijing, “use diplomacy to weave together political, military, and psychological elements into an overall strategic design.” American diplomacy, by contrast, “generally prefers …c to be ‘flexible’; it feels an obligation to break deadlocks with new proposals—unintentionally inviting new deadlocks to elicit new proposals.” We could learn a thing or two from the Chinese, Kissinger implies, particularly Sun Tzu’s concept of shi, meaning the “potential energy” of the overall strategic landscape. Our tendency is to have an agenda of 10 different points, each one to be dealt with separately. They have one big game plan. We are always in a hurry for closure, anxiously watching the minutes tick away. The Chinese value patience; as Mao explained to Kissinger, they measure time in millennia.\n\nSuch fundamental cultural differences may give rise to conflict with China in the future, Kissinger warns: “When the Chinese view of preemption encounters the Western concept of deterrence, a vicious circle can result: acts conceived as defensive in China may be treated as aggressive by the outside world; deterrent moves by the West may be interpreted in China as encirclement. The United States and China wrestled with this dilemma repeatedly during the Cold War; to some extent they have not yet found a way to transcend it.”\n\nCould the United States and the People’s Republic come to blows again? The possibility cannot be excluded. As Kissinger reminds us, war was the result when Germany rose to challenge Britain economically and geopolitically 100 years ago. Moreover, the key factor that brought America and China together in the 1970s—the common Soviet enemy the Chinese called “the polar bear”—has vanished from the scene. Old, intractable differences persist over Taiwan and North Korea. What remains is “Chimerica,” a less-than-happy marriage of economic convenience in which one partner does all the saving and the other does all the spending.\n\nIn Kissinger’s own words, China’s rise could “make international relations bipolar again,” ushering in a new cold (or possibly even hot) war. Nationalist writers like Liu Mingfu, author of China Dream, urge China to switch from “peaceful development” to “military rise” and look forward to the “duel of the century” with the United States. There are those in Washington, too—apparently including, for the moment, the Obama administration—who would relish a more confrontational relationship.   Yet Kissinger remains hopeful that cooler heads will prevail in Beijing: thinkers like Zheng Bijian, who urges China to “transcend the traditional ways for great powers to emerge” and “not [to] follow the path of Germany leading up to World War I.” Rather than attempting to “organize Asia on the basis of containing China or creating a bloc of democratic states for an ideological crusade,” the United States would do better, Kissinger suggests, to work with China to build a new “Pacific Community.”\n\nFour decades ago, Richard Nixon grasped sooner than most the huge potential of China. “Well,” he mused, “you can just stop and think of what could happen if anybody with a decent system of government got control of that mainland. Good God … There’d be no power in the world that could even—I mean, you put 800 million Chinese to work under a decent system … and they will be the leaders of the world.” That prophecy is being fulfilled in our time. The fact that until now China’s rise has been a boon to the United States rather than a bane owes much to the work of Henry Kissinger. With this book he has given his successors an indispensable guide to continuing the Sino-American “coevolution” he began.\n\n\n\nFerguson is writing a biography of Henry Kissinger.\n\n\n\n\n\fArticle 6.\n\nHurriyet Daily News\n\nSyria as Turkey’s domestic issue\n\nYusuf Kanli\n\nMay 15, 2011 -- Syria is no Libya for many reasons; not just because it is a country right on the Turkish border or, like Turkey, it has a Kurdish population and an explosion there may ignite an explosion on this side of the border as well.\n\nLike a broken watch that shows correct time twice a day, Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan as well occasionally makes some correct analysis. Last week, while comparing the uprising in Libya against the Moammar Gadhafi regime and the growing unrest in the Syrian street against the Baathist regime of Bashar al-Assad, the prime minister correctly said Libya and Syria were two totally different issues for Turkey.\n\nErdoğan explained while Turkey was very much concerned with what’s happening in Libya and have been undertaking every possible effort to contribute to a quick end to the tumult and restoration of peace and order in Libya, Syria was very much like a domestic incident for Turkey.\n\nAs part of its neo-Ottoman drive to enhance its influence in the Middle Eastern territory of the former Ottoman Empire the ruling Justice and development Party, or AKP, government of Turkey has long waived visa requirement in travel between Turkey and Syria. The aim behind that move was to plant the seeds of a future European Union-like Middle Eastern union led by Turkey but the first tangible result was not a marked increase in commercial, business or tourist interactions, but a batch of 250 refugees running from the fire on the Syrian street.\n\nIf the problem continues and escalates further in the Syrian street it is probable that the prefabricated facility in the Hatay province constructed to provide temporary lodging to pilgrims during the Hajj season will not suffice in providing a shelter to Syrian refugees who thanks to the no-visa regime in travel between Turkey and Syria may freely escape to Turkey from the trouble in their own street and thus carry the problem to the Turkish street.\n\nFor now the separatist Kurdistan Workers’ Party, or PKK, terrorists are abiding with an unilateral truce, which is claimed to have been negotiated with the government by Abdullah Öcalan, the chieftain of the gang serving an enforced life term on the İmralı island prison, which according to claims will last until June 15, three days after the June 12 parliamentary elections. Indeed, excluding some rehearsal for a possible mass civilian disobedience campaign after the elections and some exceptional terrorist acts, it might be said that there is nothing extraordinary in Turkey’s southeast bordering Syria, Iraq and Iran, where there are sizeable Kurdish populations.\n\nThe “success” of the unrest in Syrian streets in uprooting the government might mean added trouble for Turkey, which has been battling with separatist terrorism for the past 25 years. Turkey remaining silent or supportive of the Assad regime crushing the pressure for a regime change and reform calls of the Syrian street, on the other hand, would seriously imperil the regional role aspired by the AKP governance of Turkey.\n\nIndeed, while the AKP government in Ankara joined the calls of the U.S.-led coalition of the willing that time is up for Moammar Gadhafi in Libya and for peace and safety of his own people Gadhafi must step down, as regards to Syria Ankara, as well as the Western alliance, has been restraining their calls with a shy request from Assad to accelerate reforms.\n\nWhile Ankara may answer anti-Turkish demonstrations in Libya by closing down the Turkish embassy in Tripoli, the first ever such action by the diplomatic service throughout its modern history, anti-Turkish demonstrations in Damascus can be really costly for Turkey now and in the future.\n\nWhile the personal friendly relations between Assad and his counterpart in Turkey, Erdoğan, might provide Turkey a golden opportunity to help Syria sail out of the current tumultuous situation. Of course at a time when Erdoğan himself is after converting Turkey into his sultanate of fear under the aegis of advanced democracy it might be absurd to expect him to advise Assad of a democratic way out of the mess in Syria. Yet, as much as Turkey needs to see restoration of peace, security and stability in Syria for domestic security reasons as well as for its regional role, Syria and President Assad need Turkey and Erdoğan to walk the extra mile in reforms advised by them, as the real-politic of the day compels him to do so if he wants to sail out of this problem in one piece.\n\nIf, however, despite Turkey’s democracy and reform preaches, the massacres continue in the Syrian street not only the prestige of Erdoğan in the Arab street will be seriously impaired but sooner or later the fire in the Arab street will have a reflection on the Turkish streets.\n\n\n\n\n\fArticle 7.\n\nSTRATFOR\n\nThe Geopolitics of Israel: Biblical and Modern \n\n\n\nThe founding principle of geopolitics is that place — geography — plays a significant role in determining how nations will behave. If that theory is true, then there ought to be a deep continuity in a nation's foreign policy. Israel is a laboratory for this theory, since it has existed in three different manifestations in roughly the same place, twice in antiquity and once in modernity. If geopolitics is correct, then Israeli foreign policy, independent of policymakers, technology or the identity of neighbors, ought to have important common features. This is, therefore, a discussion of common principles in Israeli foreign policy over nearly 3,000 years. \nFor convenience, we will use the term \"Israel\" to connote all of the Hebrew and Jewish entities that have existed in the Levant since the invasion of the region as chronicled in the Book of Joshua. As always, geopolitics requires a consideration of three dimensions: the internal geopolitics of Israel, the interaction of Israel and the immediate neighbors who share borders with it, and Israel's interaction with what we will call great powers, beyond Israel's borderlands. \nIsrael has manifested itself three times in history. The first manifestation began with the invasion led by Joshua and lasted through its division into two kingdoms, the Babylonian conquest of the Kingdom of Judah and the deportation to Babylon early in the sixth century B.C. The second manifestation began when Israel was recreated in 540 B.C. by the Persians, who had defeated the Babylonians. The nature of this second manifestation changed in the fourth century B.C., when Greece overran the Persian Empire and Israel, and again in the first century B.C., when the Romans conquered the region. \nThe second manifestation saw Israel as a small actor within the framework of larger imperial powers, a situation that lasted until the destruction of the Jewish vassal state by the Romans. \nIsrael's third manifestation began in 1948, following (as in the other cases) an ingathering of t least some of the Jews who had been dispersed after conquests. Israel's founding takes place in the context of the decline and fall of the British Empire and must, at least in part, be understood as part of British imperial history. \nDuring its first 50 years, Israel plays a pivotal role in the confrontation of the United States and the Soviet Union and, in some senses, is hostage to the dynamics of these two countries. In other words, like the first two manifestations of Israel, the third finds Israel continually struggling among independence, internal tension and imperial ambition.\nIsraeli Geography and Borderlands \nAt its height, under King David, Israel extended from the Sinai to the Euphrates, encompassing Damascus. It occupied some, but relatively little, of the coastal region, an area beginning at what today is Haifa and running south to Jaffa, just north of today's Tel Aviv. The coastal area to the north was held by Phoenicia, the area to the south by Philistines. It is essential to understand that Israel's size and shape shifted over time. For example, Judah under the Hasmoneans did not include the Negev but did include the Golan. The general locale of Israel is fixed. Its precise borders have never been.\nThus, it is perhaps better to begin with what never was part of Israel. Israel never included the Sinai Peninsula. Along the coast, it never stretched much farther north than the Litani River in today's Lebanon. Apart from David's extreme extension (and fairly tenuous control) to the north, Israel's territory never stretched as far as Damascus, although it frequently held the Golan Heights. Israel extended many times to both sides of the Jordan but never deep into the Jordanian Desert. It never extended southeast into the Arabian Peninsula. \nIsrael consists generally of three parts. First, it always has had the northern hill region, stretching from the foothills of Mount Hermon south to Jerusalem. Second, it always contains some of the coastal plain from today's Tel Aviv north to Haifa. Third, it occupies area between Jerusalem and the Jordan River — today's West Bank. At times, it controls all or part of the Negev, including the coastal region between the Sinai to the Tel Aviv area. It may be larger than this at various times in history, and sometimes smaller, but it normally holds all or part of these three regions. \nIsrael is well-buffered in three directions. The Sinai Desert protects it against the Egyptians. In general, the Sinai has held little attraction for the Egyptians. The difficulty of deploying forces in the eastern Sinai poses severe logistical problems for them, particularly during a prolonged presence. Unless Egypt can rapidly move through the Sinai north into the coastal plain, where it can sustain its forces more readily, deploying in the Sinai is difficult and unrewarding. Therefore, so long as Israel is not so weak as to make an attack on the coastal plain a viable option, or unless Egypt is motivated by an outside imperial power, Israel does not face a threat from the southwest. \nIsrael is similarly protected from the southeast. The deserts southeast of Eilat-Aqaba are virtually impassable. No large force could approach from that direction, although smaller raiding parties could. The tribes of the Arabian Peninsula lack the reach or the size to pose a threat to Israel, unless massed and aligned with other forces. Even then, the approach from the southeast is not one that they are likely to take. The Negev is secure from that direction. \nThe eastern approaches are similarly secured by desert, which begins about 20 to 30 miles east of the Jordan River. While indigenous forces exist in the borderland east of the Jordan, they lack the numbers to be able to penetrate decisively west of the Jordan. Indeed, the normal model is that, so long as Israel controls Judea and Samaria (the modern-day West Bank), then the East Bank of the Jordan River is under the political and sometimes military domination of Israel — sometimes directly through settlement, sometimes indirectly through political influence, or economic or security leverage. \nIsrael's vulnerability is in the north. There is no natural buffer between Phoenicia and its successor entities (today's Lebanon) to the direct north. The best defense line for Israel in the north is the Litani River, but this is not an insurmountable boundary under any circumstance. However, the area along the coast north of Israel does not present a serious threat. The coastal area prospers through trade in the Mediterranean basin. It is oriented toward the sea and to the trade routes to the east, not to the south. If it does anything, this area protects those trade routes and has no appetite for a conflict that might disrupt trade. It stays out of Israel's way, for the most part. \nMoreover, as a commercial area, this region is generally wealthy, a factor that increases predators around it and social conflict within. It is an area prone to instability. Israel frequently tries to extend its influence northward for commercial reasons, as one of the predators, and this can entangle Israel in its regional politics. But barring this self-induced problem, the threat to Israel from the north is minimal, despite the absence of natural boundaries and the large population. On occasion, there is spillover of conflicts from the north, but not to a degree that might threaten regime survival in Israel. \nThe neighbor that is always a threat lies to the northeast. Syria — or, more precisely, the area governed by Damascus at any time — is populous and frequently has no direct outlet to the sea. It is, therefore, generally poor. The area to its north, Asia Minor, is heavily mountainous. Syria cannot project power to the north except with great difficulty, but powers in Asia Minor can move south. Syria's eastern flank is buffered by a desert that stretches to the Euphrates. Therefore, when there is no threat from the north, Syria's interest — after securing itself internally — is to gain access to the coast. Its primary channel is directly westward, toward the rich cities of the northern Levantine coast, with which it trades heavily. An alternative interest is southwestward, toward the southern Levantine coast controlled by Israel. \nAs can be seen, Syria can be interested in Israel only selectively. When it is interested, it has a serious battle problem. To attack Israel, it would have to strike between Mount Hermon and the Sea of Galilee, an area about 25 miles wide. The Syrians potentially can attack south of the sea, but only if they are prepared to fight through this region and then attack on extended supply lines. If an attack is mounted along the main route, Syrian forces must descend the Golan Heights and then fight through the hilly Galilee before reaching the coastal plain — sometimes with guerrillas holding out in the Galilean hills. The Galilee is an area that is relatively easy to defend and difficult to attack. Therefore, it is only once Syria takes the Galilee, and can control its lines of supply against guerrilla attack, that its real battle begins. \nTo reach the coast or move toward Jerusalem, Syria must fight through a plain in front of a line of low hills. This is the decisive battleground where massed Israeli forces, close to lines of supply, can defend against dispersed Syrian forces on extended lines of supply. It is no accident that Megiddo — or Armageddon, as the plain is sometimes referred to — has apocalyptic meaning. This is the point at which any move from Syria would be decided. But a Syrian offensive would have a tough fight to reach Megiddo, and a tougher one as it deploys on the plain. \nOn the surface, Israel lacks strategic depth, but this is true only on the surface. It faces limited threats from southern neighbors. To its east, it faces only a narrow strip of populated area east of the Jordan. To the north, there is a maritime commercial entity. Syria operating alone, forced through the narrow gap of the Mount Hermon-Galilee line and operating on extended supply lines, can be dealt with readily. \nThere is a risk of simultaneous attacks from multiple directions. Depending on the forces deployed and the degree of coordination between them, this can pose a problem for Israel. However, even here the Israelis have the tremendous advantage of fighting on interior lines. Egypt and Syria, fighting on external lines (and widely separated fronts), would have enormous difficulty transferring forces from one front to another. Israel, on interior lines (fronts close to each other with good transportation), would be able to move its forces from front to front rapidly, allowing for sequential engagement and thereby the defeat of enemies. Unless enemies are carefully coordinated and initiate war simultaneously — and deploy substantially superior force on at least one front — Israel can initiate war at a time of its choosing or else move its forces rapidly between fronts, negating much of the advantage of size that the attackers might have. \nThere is another aspect to the problem of multifront war. Egypt usually has minimal interests along the Levant, having its own coast and an orientation to the south toward the headwaters of the Nile. On the rare occasions when Egypt does move through the Sinai and attacks to the north and northeast, it is in an expansionary mode. By the time it consolidates and exploits the coastal plain, it would be powerful enough to threaten Syria. From Syria's point of view, the only thing more dangerous than Israel is an Egypt in control of Israel. Therefore, the probability of a coordinated north-south strike at Israel is rare, is rarely coordinated and usually is not designed to be a mortal blow. It is defeated by Israel's strategic advantage of interior lines. \nIsraeli Geography and the Convergence Zone\nTherefore, it is not surprising that Israel's first incarnation lasted as long as it did — some five centuries. What is interesting and what must be considered is why Israel (now considered as the northern kingdom) was defeated by the Assyrians and Judea, then defeated by Babylon. To understand this, we need to consider the broader geography of Israel's location. \nIsrael is located on the eastern shore of the Mediterranean Sea, on the Levant. As we have seen, when Israel is intact, it will tend to be the dominant power in the Levant. Therefore, Israeli resources must generally be dedicated for land warfare, leaving little over for naval warfare. In general, although Israel had excellent harbors and access to wood for shipbuilding, it never was a major Mediterranean naval power. It never projected power into the sea. The area to the north of Israel has always been a maritime power, but Israel, the area south of Mount Hermon, was always forced to be a land power. \nThe Levant in general and Israel in particular has always been a magnet for great powers. No Mediterranean empire could be fully secure unless it controlled the Levant. Whether it was Rome or Carthage, a Mediterranean empire that wanted to control both the northern and southern littorals needed to anchor its eastern flank on the Levant. For one thing, without the Levant, a Mediterranean power would be entirely dependent on sea lanes for controlling the other shore. Moving troops solely by sea creates transport limitations and logistical problems. It also leaves imperial lines vulnerable to interdiction — sometimes merely from pirates, a problem that plagued Rome's sea transport. A land bridge, or a land bridge with minimal water crossings that can be easily defended, is a vital supplement to the sea for the movement of large numbers of troops. Once the Hellespont is crossed, the coastal route through southern Turkey, down the Levant and along the Mediterranean's southern shore, provides such an alternative. \nThere is an additional consideration. If a Mediterranean empire leaves the Levant unoccupied, it opens the door to the possibility of a great power originating to the east seizing the ports of the Levant and challenging the Mediterranean power for maritime domination. In short, control of the Levant binds a Mediterranean empire together while denying a challenger from the east the opportunity to enter the Mediterranean. Holding the Levant, and controlling Israel, is a necessary preventive measure for a Mediterranean empire. \nIsrael is also important to any empire originating to the east of Israel, either in the Tigris-Euphrates basin or in Persia. For either, security could be assured only once it had an anchor on the Levant. Macedonian expansion under Alexander demonstrated that a power controlling Levantine and Turkish ports could support aggressive operations far to the east, to the Hindu Kush and beyond. While Turkish ports might have sufficed for offensive operations, simply securing the Bosporus still left the southern flank exposed. Therefore, by holding the Levant, an eastern power protected itself against attacks from Mediterranean powers. \nThe Levant was also important to any empire originating to the north or south of Israel. If Egypt decided to move beyond the Nile Basin and North Africa eastward, it would move first through the Sinai and then northward along the coastal plain, securing sea lanes to Egypt. When Asia Minor powers such as the Ottoman Empire developed, there was a natural tendency to move southward to control the eastern Mediterranean. The Levant is the crossroads of continents, and Israel lies in the path of many imperial ambitions. \nIsrael therefore occupies what might be called the convergence zone of the Eastern Hemisphere. A European power trying to dominate the Mediterranean or expand eastward, an eastern power trying to dominate the space between the Hindu Kush and the Mediterranean, a North African power moving toward the east, or a northern power moving south — all must converge on the eastern coast of the Mediterranean and therefore on Israel. Of these, the European power and the eastern power must be the most concerned with Israel. For either, there is no choice but to secure it as an anchor.\nInternal Geopolitics \nIsrael is geographically divided into three regions, which traditionally have produced three different types of people. Its coastal plain facilitates commerce, serving as the interface between eastern trade routes and the sea. It is the home of merchants and manufacturers, cosmopolitans — not as cosmopolitan as Phoenicia or Lebanon, but cosmopolitan for Israel. The northeast is hill country, closest to the unruliness north of the Litani River and to the Syrian threat. It breeds farmers and warriors. The area south of Jerusalem is hard desert country, more conducive to herdsman and warriors than anything else. Jerusalem is where these three regions are balanced and governed. \nThere are obviously deep differences built into Israel's geography and inhabitants, particularly between the herdsmen of the southern deserts and the northern hill dwellers. The coastal dwellers, rich but less warlike than the others, hold the balance or are the prize to be pursued. In the division of the original kingdom between Israel and Judea, we saw the alliance of the coast with the Galilee, while Jerusalem was held by the desert dwellers. The consequence of the division was that Israel in the north ultimately was conquered by Assyrians from the northeast, while Babylon was able to swallow Judea. \nSocial divisions in Israel obviously do not have to follow geographical lines. However, over time, these divisions must manifest themselves. For example, the coastal plain is inherently more cosmopolitan than the rest of the country. The interests of its inhabitants lie more with trading partners in the Mediterranean and the rest of the world than with their countrymen. Their standard of living is higher, and their commitment to traditions is lower. Therefore, there is an inherent tension between their immediate interests and those of the Galileans, who live more precarious, warlike lives. Countries can be divided over lesser issues — and when Israel is divided, it is vulnerable even to regional threats. \nWe say \"even\" because geography dictates that regional threats are less menacing than might be expected. The fact that Israel would be outnumbered demographically should all its neighbors turn on it is less important than the fact that it has adequate buffers in most directions, that the ability of neighbors to coordinate an attack is minimal and that their appetite for such an attack is even less. The single threat that Israel faces from the northeast can readily be managed if the Israelis create a united front there. When Israel was overrun by a Damascus-based power, it was deeply divided internally. \nIt is important to add one consideration to our discussion of buffers, which is diplomacy. The main neighbors of Israel are Egyptians, Syrians and those who live on the east bank of Jordan. This last group is a negligible force demographically, and the interests of the Syrians and Egyptians are widely divergent. Egypt's interests are to the south and west of its territory; the Sinai holds no attraction. Syria is always threatened from multiple directions, and alliance with Egypt adds little to its security. Therefore, under the worst of circumstances, Egypt and Syria have difficulty supporting each other. Under the best of circumstances, from Israel's point of view, it can reach a political accommodation with Egypt, securing its southwestern frontier politically as well as by geography, thus freeing Israel to concentrate on the northern threats and opportunities.\nIsrael and the Great Powers \nThe threat to Israel rarely comes from the region, except when the Israelis are divided internally. The conquests of Israel occur when powers not adjacent to it begin forming empires. Babylon, Persia, Macedonia, Rome, Turkey and Britain all controlled Israel politically, sometimes for worse and sometimes for better. Each dominated it militarily, but none was a neighbor of Israel. This is a consistent pattern. Israel can resist its neighbors; danger arises when more distant powers begin playing imperial games. Empires can bring force to bear that Israel cannot resist. \nIsrael therefore has this problem: It would be secure if it could confine itself to protecting its interests from neighbors, but it cannot confine itself because its geographic location invariably draws larger, more distant powers toward Israel. Therefore, while Israel's military can focus only on immediate interests, its diplomatic interests must look much further. Israel is constantly entangled with global interests (as the globe is defined at any point), seeking to deflect and align with broader global powers. When it fails in this diplomacy, the consequences can be catastrophic. \nIsrael exists in three conditions. First, it can be a completely independent state. This condition occurs when there are no major imperial powers external to the region. We might call this the David model. Second, it can live as part of an imperial system — either as a subordinate ally, as a moderately autonomous entity or as a satrapy. In any case, it maintains its identity but loses room for independent maneuvering in foreign policy and potentially in domestic policy. We might call this the Persian model in its most beneficent form. Finally, Israel can be completely crushed — with mass deportations and migrations, with a complete loss of autonomy and minimal residual autonomy. We might call this the Babylonian model. \nThe Davidic model exists primarily when there is no external imperial power needing control of the Levant that is in a position either to send direct force or to support surrogates in the immediate region. The Persian model exists when Israel aligns itself with the foreign policy interests of such an imperial power, to its own benefit. The Babylonian model exists when Israel miscalculates on the broader balance of power and attempts to resist an emerging hegemon. When we look at Israeli behavior over time, the periods when Israel does not confront hegemonic powers outside the region are not rare, but are far less common than when it is confronting them. \nGiven the period of the first iteration of Israel, it would be too much to say that the Davidic model rarely comes into play, but certainly since that time, variations of the Persian and Babylonian models have dominated. The reason is geographic. Israel is normally of interest to outside powers because of its strategic position. While Israel can deal with local challenges effectively, it cannot deal with broader challenges. It lacks the economic or military weight to resist. Therefore, it is normally in the process of managing broader threats or collapsing because of them. \nThe Geopolitics of Contemporary Israel\nLet us then turn to the contemporary manifestation of Israel. Israel was recreated because of the interaction between a regional great power, the Ottoman Empire, and a global power, Great Britain. During its expansionary phase, the Ottoman Empire sought to dominate the eastern Mediterranean as well as both its northern and southern coasts. One thrust went through the Balkans toward central Europe. The other was toward Egypt. Inevitably, this required that the Ottomans secure the Levant. \nFor the British, the focus on the eastern Mediterranean was as the primary sea lane to India. As such, Gibraltar and the Suez were crucial. The importance of the Suez was such that the presence of a hostile, major naval force in the eastern Mediterranean represented a direct threat to British interests. It followed that defeating the Ottoman Empire during World War I and breaking its residual naval power was critical. The British, as was shown at Gallipoli, lacked the resources to break the Ottoman Empire by main force. They resorted to a series of alliances with local forces to undermine the Ottomans. One was an alliance with Bedouin tribes in the Arabian Peninsula; others involved covert agreements with anti-Turkish, Arab interests from the Levant to the Persian Gulf. A third, minor thrust was aligning with Jewish interests globally, particularly those interested in the refounding of Israel. Britain had little interest in this goal, but saw such discussions as part of the process of destabilizing the Ottomans. \nThe strategy worked. Under an agreement with France, the Ottoman province of Syria was divided into two parts on a line roughly running east-west between the sea and Mount Hermon. The northern part was given to France and divided into Lebanon and a rump Syria entity. The southern part was given to Britain and was called Palestine, after the Ottoman administrative district Filistina. Given the complex politics of the Arabian Peninsula, the British had to find a home for a group of Hashemites, which they located on the east bank of the Jordan River and designated, for want of a better name, the Trans-Jordan — the other side of the Jordan. Palestine looked very much like traditional Israel. \nThe ideological foundations of Zionism are not our concern here, nor are the pre- and post-World War II migrations of Jews, although those are certainly critical. What is important for purposes of this analysis are two things: First, the British emerged economically and militarily crippled from World War II and unable to retain their global empire, Palestine included. Second, the two global powers that emerged after World War II — the United States and the Soviet Union — were engaged in an intense struggle for the eastern Mediterranean after World War II, as can be seen in the Greek and Turkish issues at that time. Neither wanted to see the British Empire survive, each wanted the Levant, and neither was prepared to make a decisive move to take it. \nBoth the United States and the Soviet Union saw the re-creation of Israel as an opportunity to introduce their power to the Levant. The Soviets thought they might have some influence over Israel due to ideology. The Americans thought they might have some influence given the role of American Jews in the founding. Neither was thinking particularly clearly about the matter, because neither had truly found its balance after World War II. Both knew the Levant was important, but neither saw the Levant as a central battleground at that moment. Israel slipped through the cracks. \nOnce the question of Jewish unity was settled through ruthless action by David Ben Gurion's government, Israel faced a simultaneous threat from all of its immediate neighbors. However, as we have seen, the threat in 1948 was more apparent than real. The northern Levant, Lebanon, was fundamentally disunited — far more interested in regional maritime trade and concerned about control from Damascus. It posed no real threat to Israel. Jordan, settling the eastern bank of the Jordan River, was an outside power that had been transplanted into the region and was more concerned about native Arabs — the Palestinians — than about Israel. The Jordanians secretly collaborated with Israel. Egypt did pose a threat, but its ability to maintain lines of supply across the Sinai was severely limited and its genuine interest in engaging and destroying Israel was more rhetorical than real. As usual, the Egyptians could not afford the level of effort needed to move into the Levant. Syria by itself had a very real interest in Israel's defeat, but by itself was incapable of decisive action. \nThe exterior lines of Israel's neighbors prevented effective, concerted action. Israel's interior lines permitted efficient deployment and redeployment of force. It was not obvious at the time, but in retrospect we can see that once Israel existed, was united and had even limited military force, its survival was guaranteed. That is, so long as no great power was opposed to its existence. \nFrom its founding until the Camp David Accords re-established the Sinai as a buffer with Egypt, Israel's strategic problem was this: So long as Egypt was in the Sinai, Israel's national security requirements outstripped its military capabilities. It could not simultaneously field an army, maintain its civilian economy and produce all the weapons and supplies needed for war. Israel had to align itself with great powers who saw an opportunity to pursue other interests by arming Israel. \nIsrael's first patron was the Soviet Union — through Czechoslovakia — which supplied weapons before and after 1948 in the hopes of using Israel to gain a foothold in the eastern Mediterranean. Israel, aware of the risks of losing autonomy, also moved into a relationship with a declining great power that was fighting to retain its empire: France. Struggling to hold onto Algeria and in constant tension with Arabs, France saw Israel as a natural ally. And apart from the operation against Suez in 1956, Israel saw in France a patron that was not in a position to reduce Israeli autonomy. However, with the end of the Algerian war and the realignment of France in the Arab world, Israel became a liability to France and, after 1967, Israel lost French patronage. \nIsrael did not become a serious ally of the Americans until after 1967. Such an alliance was in the American interest. The United States had, as a strategic imperative, the goal of keeping the Soviet navy out of the Mediterranean or, at least, blocking its unfettered access. That meant that Turkey, controlling the Bosporus, had to be kept in the American bloc. Syria and Iraq shifted policies in the late 1950s and by the mid-1960s had been armed by the Soviets. This made Turkey's position precarious: If the Soviets pressed from the north while Syria and Iraq pressed from the south, the outcome would be uncertain, to say the least, and the global balance of power was at stake.\nThe United States used Iran to divert Iraq's attention. Israel was equally useful in diverting Syria's attention. So long as Israel threatened Syria from the south, it could not divert its forces to the north. That helped secure Turkey at a relatively low cost in aid and risk. By aligning itself with the interests of a great power, Israel lost some of its room for maneuver: For example, in 1973, it was limited by the United States in what it could do to Egypt. But those limitations aside, it remained autonomous internally and generally free to pursue its strategic interests. \nThe end of hostilities with Egypt, guaranteed by the Sinai buffer zone, created a new era for Israel. Egypt was restored to its traditional position, Jordan was a marginal power on the east bank, Lebanon was in its normal, unstable mode, and only Syria was a threat. However, it was a threat that Israel could easily deal with. Syria by itself could not threaten the survival of Israel. \nFollowing Camp David (an ironic name), Israel was in its Davidic model, in a somewhat modified sense. Its survival was not at stake. Its problems — the domination of a large, hostile population and managing events in the northern Levant — were subcritical (meaning that, though these were not easy tasks, they did not represent fundamental threats to national survival, so long as Israel retained national unity). When unified, Israel has never been threatened by its neighbors. Geography dictates against it.\nIsrael's danger will come only if a great power seeks to dominate the Mediterranean Basin or to occupy the region between Afghanistan and the Mediterranean. In the short period since the fall of the Soviet Union, this has been impossible. There has been no great power with the appetite and the will for such an adventure. But 15 years is not even a generation, and Israel must measure its history in centuries. \nIt is the nature of the international system to seek balance. The primary reality of the world today is the overwhelming power of the United States. The United States makes few demands on Israel that matter. However, it is the nature of things that the United States threatens the interests of other great powers who, individually weak, will try to form coalitions against it. Inevitably, such coalitions will arise. That will be the next point of danger for Israel. \nIn the event of a global rivalry, the United States might place onerous requirements on Israel. Alternatively, great powers might move into the Jordan River valley or ally with Syria, move into Lebanon or ally with Israel. The historical attraction of the eastern shore of the Mediterranean would focus the attention of such a power and lead to attempts to assert control over the Mediterranean or create a secure Middle Eastern empire. In either event, or some of the others discussed, it would create a circumstance in which Israel might face a Babylonian catastrophe or be forced into some variation of a Persian or Roman subjugation. \nIsrael's danger is not a Palestinian rising. Palestinian agitation is an irritant that Israel can manage so long as it does not undermine Israeli unity. Whether it is managed by domination or by granting the Palestinians a vassal state matters little. Nor can Israel be threatened by its neighbors. Even a unified attack by Syria and Egypt would fail, for the reasons discussed. Israel's real threat, as can be seen in history, lies in the event of internal division and/or a great power, coveting Israel's geographical position, marshalling force that is beyond its capacity to resist. Even that can be managed if Israel has a patron whose interests involve denying the coast to another power. \nIsrael's reality is this. It is a small country, yet must manage threats arising far outside of its region. It can survive only if it maneuvers with great powers commanding enormously greater resources. Israel cannot match the resources and, therefore, it must be constantly clever. There are periods when it is relatively safe because of great power alignments, but its normal condition is one of global unease. No nation can be clever forever, and Israel's history shows that some form of subordination is inevitable. Indeed, it is to a very limited extent subordinate to the United States now. \nFor Israel, the retention of a Davidic independence is difficult. Israel's strategy must be to manage its subordination effectively by dealing with its patron cleverly, as it did with Persia. But cleverness is not a geopolitical concept. It is not permanent, and it is not assured.
